Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:45 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 A full house.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry to keep you waiting. That\'s the last thing I\'d like to do on this Monday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 But I actually don\'t have any announcements at the top, so I\'m happy to start with your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Eric.\xc2\xa0 So with all the economic turmoil following the decision to exit the EU, is it important for Great Britain to begin making its transition now out of the EU quickly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, what we have said is that this will be a process for the EU to work out with the UK.\xc2\xa0 I understand that the UK will need to file its Article 50 before that process can commence.\xc2\xa0 But what we expect is for there to be an orderly process.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that the UK will need to trigger that Article 50 as the sort of first starting point for that process to commence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At this stage, it looks like it may not happen until the fall.\xc2\xa0 With all that\'s going on in the markets, is that too late?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said is that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be a process and a decision -- timeline for the UK to work out with the EU.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to remain engaged and we\'re going to watch it closely, but those are decisions that are going to be principally made by those two governments.\xc2\xa0 And again, our expectation and our priority is on making sure it\'s an orderly process, it\'s organized, it\'s transparent, and as the leadership of both the EU and the UK work out that process, our expectation is that they share those goals as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with the Supreme Court granting a reprieve today of the former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, did the Court make it easier for officials to I guess sell access to their office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, it is going to be difficult for me to weigh in on that case because even though it\'s been heard in front of the United States Supreme Court it\'s an ongoing criminal matter.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m going to have to reserve comment on that particular case and refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are U.S. officials at all suggesting or weighing in with their counterparts in the UK or EU on whether the Article 50 should be invoked right away in order to have the orderly process that you all keep talking about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, our view is that that\'s going to be a decision made by the government of the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 They obviously have to work through this process.\xc2\xa0 They should do so closely coordinated with their counterparts in the EU.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s going to be a procedure that\'s put in place by the two governments.\xc2\xa0 I understand that Prime Minister Cameron has suggested that they will invoke Article 50 into the fall.\xc2\xa0 And again, our expectation is that when this process happens it will be done in an orderly way, organized and transparent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how concerned is the White House about the political chaos that we\'re seeing in the United Kingdom right now, given that the Prime Minister is only staying until October and the opposition seems to be having some difficulties?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to be hard for me to comment about American domestic politics let alone British domestic politics.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that it\'s my understanding that it\'s not even clear if there\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be elections to succeed Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 That might happen in a conference or caucus session later in the fall.\xc2\xa0 So I understand that the experts there are working through that process and that\'s going to take some time to figure out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you, broadly speaking, that the President has said that our relationship with the United Kingdom is not only special and unique it\'s enduring.\xc2\xa0 And so we expect that the close ties between not only the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States but the people of the United States and the United Kingdom will continue.\xc2\xa0 We believe the links and ties between our two countries transcends any particular politicians, and so we expect the close ties between our two countries to endure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You told us last week about the calls between the President and two of his counterparts right after the Brexit vote, but I\'m wondering whether he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken with additional leaders over the weekend, if you can tell us about any of those calls.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, I don\'t have any additional presidential calls to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that all appropriate facets of our administration have been engaged on this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to give you a few of the highlights.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know Secretary Kerry spoke Friday with his counterparts in the United Kingdom and in the EU.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Secretary Kerry met with his Italian counterpart, and today Secretary Kerry is in Brussels, where he met with the EU President, the EU High Representative, and the NATO Secretary General.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry I believe is either on his way or is in London right now, where he\'ll be meeting with Prime Minister Cameron and his counterpart, the UK Foreign Secretary.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know Secretary Lew has been in touch with all of his counterparts in the G7.\xc2\xa0 He has spoken several times with his counterparts -- in addition to Chancellor Merkel, United Kingdom Chancellor Osborne, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also spoken with a number of financial market participants.\xc2\xa0 This is on top of a conference call that Secretary Lew participated in with all of the G7 finance ministers.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s also on top of an engagement Secretary Carter had with his counterpart with the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will also tell you that our Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, Wally Adeyemo, has been attending the G20 sherpa meeting in China, and I\'m confident in telling you that this has been a part of his conversations.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s part of the administration outreach that\'s going on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You keep on talking about this being orderly or the expectation that this is going to be orderly.\xc2\xa0 But S&amp;P just stripped the UK of its top credit rating.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering what evidence you\'re seeing that this is happening in an orderly fashion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that this has prompted volatility in the immediate term in the financial markets.\xc2\xa0 But as we move forward, it\'s important to stress that the United Kingdom, European and global policymakers have the tools necessary to not just support financial stability but also to promote economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is our experts, including Secretary Lew, are confident that the United Kingdom policymakers have the tools necessary to promote economic financial stability.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve actually taken a look recently and believe that these banks and financial systems are in much better shape compared to recent years.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s why you\'re seeing our experts speak confidently about the orderly process moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Given that this is going to be a lengthy process, what do you think is the earliest -- or what are you looking at as the time frame for when the U.S. is going to have to negotiate a trade deal -- with Britain?\xc2\xa0 Are we talking two years?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a chance, in your view, that that\'s going to happen sooner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, the economic rationale for the T-TIP agreement remains strong.\xc2\xa0 And we intend to continue working with the EU to conclude negotiations as soon as feasible. I know that our United States Trade Representative has set a goal for the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 I know that that work continues in earnest.\xc2\xa0 And quite frankly, the United States Trade Representative\xe2\x80\x99s team is evaluating what the impact of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s decision is on T-TIP.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\'ll be engaging the European Union on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will also say that heretofore our negotiations have been with the European Commission, obviously the governing structure for the European Union.\xc2\xa0 So if we have to start again with the UK, that\'s going to just be at a different starting point.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a matter of sort of sequence and factual underpinnings of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t have a new time frame to work out with you right now.\xc2\xa0 But I can say that concluding these negotiations remains a priority for this President.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\'s a process that\'s been underway for years, so we\'re obviously very -- we\'ve made a lot of progress.\xc2\xa0 We\'re quite far along in that process with the EU.\xc2\xa0 And if we have to start that with the UK, it\'s just going to be from a different starting point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But given the volatility and the shakeup that this has caused, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this set T-TIP -- and maybe you could extrapolate that out to the TPP as well -- does this kind of slow everything in terms of big trade deals that were already facing obstacles?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take each of those in turn.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to getting a T-TIP agreement has not waned in light of the decision by the British people over the weekend. So that work is going to continue.\xc2\xa0 That work is principally headed out of our United States Trade Representative\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in constant negotiations, principally with the European Commission.\xc2\xa0 So that work is going to continue.\xc2\xa0 In terms of how the Brexit decision affects those negotiations, they\xe2\x80\x99re working through that right now.\xc2\xa0 Again, if we have to start negotiating separately with the United Kingdom, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to start from a different vantage point, especially because we\xe2\x80\x99ve had years of progress and work completed with the European Commission.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of TPP, this was obviously a deal that was negotiated because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to make sure that the United States of America sets the rules of the road when it comes to trade with our partners in the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 That deal was consummated earlier this year, and now heads to the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated timeline.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, this is an issue that carries with it political complications.\xc2\xa0 The President is acutely aware of that.\xc2\xa0 He understands this has been a difficult issue in the past.\xc2\xa0 He also understand that previous trade agreements have not lived up to the hype.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s actually why he insisted on the toughest human rights, labor, and environmental standards ever to exist in a trade agreement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s confident this will pass congressional approval.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And when we heard from both the President and the Vice President last week, after the vote, they both talked about the nationalistic sentiment that led up to leaving the EU.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, the Vice President used the words \xe2\x80\x9cnationalism,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cisolationism\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cxenophobia.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So seeing that vote turn out the way it did, does this raise the possibility that those same sentiments will win out in the U.S. in November?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question and I think a lot of people have been speculating about this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to see whether a referendum in the United Kingdom can project a lot about a domestic political race in the United States five months from now.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it to pundits and my highly paid colleagues on television to offer their views on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say that, as you point out, the President and the Vice President have remarked recently and even before this decision that every country has had to cope with globalization and with international trends.\xc2\xa0 So this isn\xe2\x80\x99t something new that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with this past weekend.\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to know that the President has remarked repeatedly that in moments of uncertainty there are some who have impulses to pull back and to cower and react out of fear.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen some of these moments in our history.\xc2\xa0 There are episodes that are generally dark and that we generally regret.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has a different approach.\xc2\xa0 The President believes we succeed when we are as inclusive as possible and when we embrace not only America\xe2\x80\x99s strengths but also America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just tell you why.\xc2\xa0 We live in a smaller world than ever before.\xc2\xa0 Our national security is more closely linked than at any other time in history.\xc2\xa0 And the interconnectiveness of our global economy is evident nearly every day and sometimes even hourly.\xc2\xa0 Given these facts, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make much sense to retreat or to build barricades with other countries.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also not in our interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at what we\'ve been able to accomplish with America leading the world.\xc2\xa0 As you know, just under 200 countries signed the first-ever agreement to combat climate change.\xc2\xa0 Nearly 200 countries are taking concrete steps to make sure our planet is preserved for generations to come.\xc2\xa0 Six of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent powers -- who don\'t often see eye-to-eye -- came together to impose the most -- strictest, heaviest sanctions on Iran, which leveraged them to come to the negotiating table and ultimately found a solution to cut off Iran\xe2\x80\x99s path to a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you pointed out, we were able to secure a trade agreement with 12 other countries, which advanced America\xe2\x80\x99s interests, so that America is writing the rules of the road on trade and not China.\xc2\xa0 We assembled a coalition of *68 66 partners to combat the threat against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The Arab world is heavily represented in that coalition.\xc2\xa0 That just didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear overnight.\xc2\xa0 That didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear by itself.\xc2\xa0 It was because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to lead the international community against this threat that that coalition was formed and continues to have success to this day.</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo more examples: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on the international stage has isolated Russia more than ever before in recent history.\xc2\xa0 They violated international norms.\xc2\xa0 They violated another country\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 And the sanctions imposed on that country have led it to shrink its economy by one-sixth.\xc2\xa0 Those weren\xe2\x80\x99t just bilateral sanctions, those were sanctions that had the effect they did because of the United States working with our partners around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLastly, Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, reopening relations there have not only changed the way we interact with the Cuban people and offers that country a much brighter future, it\'s also in our economic interest, it\'s in our security interest, but it\'s also rewriting all of the relationships in the Western Hemisphere. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is proud of his record leading the United States in the international community.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s one that\'s not going to stop for the next six months.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I first wanted to go back to Roberta\'s question about the political turmoil in the UK.\xc2\xa0 I know you\'ve described some of the outstanding questions, but I think what I wanted to get at a little bit is whether the UK needs to do a better job of laying out the answers to those questions, how the election process -- or lack of election process -- is going to work.\xc2\xa0 So if you could comment on that.\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to weigh into it, is it implicitly saying that you\'re not worried that that political turmoil could continue to roil markets in a way that would threaten the U.S. economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\'re right, I\'m not going to weigh into the domestic political situation in Britain.\xc2\xa0 All I would say is the President spoke with Prime Cameron over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 They had a very good conversation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Prime Minister Cameron is a good friend of the President.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve worked together on a host issues, ranging from the fight against Ebola to fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The UK remains a valued member of NATO.\xc2\xa0 They\'re actually one of the few countries that not only committed to making 2 percent of their GDP defense-related, but have lived up that commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President deeply values his relation with Prime Minister Cameron, but he also knows that the bonds between the United Kingdom and the United States are going to endure.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any political prognostication for you to do on the British domestic process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s not prognostication as much as do you think the UK needs to say, this is the sort of time frame, this is the timeline, this is how things are going to work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that will happen.\xc2\xa0 I think the British people and the British government will lay out a time frame for that to happen.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not going to second-guess that from here in advance of them doing so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that you guys were caught by surprise by Brexit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 National Security Advisor Susan Rice spoke over the weekend, and she made clear that we have contingency plans for both outcomes.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we had hoped for a different outcome, but it would have been irresponsible to not plan for both outcomes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Secretary Lew spoke with Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 That\'s in addition to President Obama doing so.\xc2\xa0 Can you just kind of describe what you see is her role in addressing the sort of crisis that has resulted in Brexit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can.\xc2\xa0 Yes, so Secretary Lew spoke with Chancellor Merkel in the past day or so, and the President spoke with Chancellor Merkel over the weekend -- or early Friday, I guess.\xc2\xa0 And in that conversation, the President and the Chancellor expressed regret for the decision, but they also expressed respect for the decision and the acknowledgement that the British people have spoken.\xc2\xa0 And in light of that, there needs to be an orderly process for which the UK can depart the European Union.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, there\'s some sequencing there that still needs to be worked out.\xc2\xa0 But I think that obviously the President has deep respect for Chancellor Merkel and her leadership not only in Germany, but also as one of our NATO allies.\xc2\xa0 And so I expect the President to continue to be in close touch with Chancellor Merkel, but I also expect members of the administration and White House staff to be in close touch with their counterparts and the German government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 There were reports over the weekend that millions of dollars\' worth of CIA weapons were sold by Jordanian intelligence officials -- they were intended for the rebels in Syria.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you could talk about that situation, but also whether it sort of undercuts your guys\' claims that the people that these weapons were going to were carefully vetted and what the impact on the relationship with Jordan might be.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the relationship with Jordan, obviously we remain committed to Jordan\'s security and stability. We\'re proud to stand side by side with Jordan in the global coalition to counter ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Jordan has been a valuable partner in that effort, and we appreciate all of their contributions.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor questions regarding this particular episode, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is, there\'s an ongoing investigation into that particular shooting, so I would have to refer you to the FBI on the latest on that.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the International Police Training Center, that is a center that has been stood up to promote training for the Jordanians and international security forces.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a center that\'s supported by our State Department, so if you have questions about that center, that State Department would be point for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just said that National Security Advisor Rice was planning contingencies.\xc2\xa0 What were some of the concerns that had to be planned for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron, I think that we had made our views clear on this, that our belief was that a strong European Union includes the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 So obviously that\'s a view that the President had.\xc2\xa0 But we also believe that this was a decision for the British people.\xc2\xa0 So given the vote -- we had wanted this to come out in the direction, but in the weeks and months ahead of that, there\'s meetings and contingency plans built.\xc2\xa0 Those are principally an interagency process that\'s mostly at our Department of Treasury and our Department of State, but coordinated by the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of a national security concern to America is this?\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked a lot about the trade deals and economics involved, but how much of this -- how much does this affect America\'s national security that Britain is no longer going to be in the EU?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, the good news is -- Ambassador Rice addressed this yesterday as well, and she made clear that the UK will remain a key leader with the NATO Alliance, and we look forward to the UK\'s participation in the July 8th NATO Summit in Warsaw.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President will be there, and obviously this will be an item on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to continue to work bilaterally and through NATO to ensure our collective security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Carter has spoken to his British counterpart, Secretary Fallon, to affirm that the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom will remain a bedrock of U.S. security and defense policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we mentioned before, the U.S. and the UK have close ties. A lot of those ties are in the security arena.\xc2\xa0 So you look at intelligence-sharing, you look at our efforts to combat ISIL, you look at defense spending.\xc2\xa0 So those are ties that are not going to change in light of the UK\'s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I feel like the special relationship changes because of this missing economic component of it, which is significant.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, in our view, the special relationship endures.\xc2\xa0 Like I mentioned to Michelle and Roberta, the actual negotiations over the T-TIP need to be looked at.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of our economic ties with Britain, they remain strong and vibrant as they ever have been.\xc2\xa0 And so if you look at our commercial ties, our trade, if you look at cultural exchanges -- people-to-people -- those remain strong and robust, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that to wane in light of the decision by the British people from the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the economics and trade, the President famously said "back of the queue," and you have to take him at his word.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We do.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what I meant when I said that the negotiations for T-TIP have been going on for years and we are so far along that our United States Trade Representative, Michael Froman, has said he wants to close them out by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 So if we have to start from the beginning with the British people, it\'s just going to, as a matter of fact, be at a different queue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it will substantively as important a relationship between the United States and a smaller Britain.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not analogous.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a huge trading bloc of 20-plus nations versus one nation that you\'re now negotiating.\xc2\xa0 Some of this is theoretical, obviously, because it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\'re right, the departure hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.\xc2\xa0 But I guess I\'d dispute the suggestion that our relationship with Britain is going to be altered from the sort of closeness that we have now.\xc2\xa0 If you take a look at a lot of the areas where we have intense cooperation -- that\'s the counter-ISIL campaign; that\'s, again, our cooperation within NATO; again, Britain is one of the few countries to live up to its commitment to assign 2 percent of its GDP for defense spending.\xc2\xa0 That\'s robust intelligence-sharing.\xc2\xa0 That\'s bilateral trade -- existing bilateral trade.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s also cultural exchanges.\xc2\xa0 All of these links will continue even in the wake of what the British people decided on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, on Brexit.\xc2\xa0 Scotland and Northern Ireland\xc2\xa0 -- is the President going to weigh in on that?\xc2\xa0 As he said, friends should tell friends what friends think.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And he stepped into London and he said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sounds like a PSA, Ron.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point is, does he have a position on whether Scotland and Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, when this came up for a referendum back in the fall of 2014, the President did weigh in.\xc2\xa0 At the time, he said that this was a decision for the Scottish people to make.\xc2\xa0 But he also made clear that he believes a United Kingdom is a strong United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new positions to read out right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, is there any new word on the Hillary Clinton -- you anticipated it obviously -- the delayed Wisconsin event.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President and Secretary Clinton were scheduled to campaign together in Green Bay a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 In light of the terrorist attack in Orlando, that even was pulled down.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet have an update for the schedule.\xc2\xa0 I can affirm for you that the President is eager to get out there on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 I think some of you got a taste of that over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 He had a few political events where he articulated the case that he\'ll be making.\xc2\xa0 But we don\'t yet have that nailed down in the schedule yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two, following up on what Ron said.\xc2\xa0 Why is he so eager?\xc2\xa0 Is the eagerness about trying to secure or help secure votes for Hillary Clinton that are still kind of out there, weighing their options between the two presumptive nominees?\xc2\xa0 Or is it because he\xe2\x80\x99s back on the trail for one last time, even though it\'s not for himself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s neither.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot at stake in this election.\xc2\xa0 If you look at a range of national security and domestic issues, the views of the two candidates could not be further apart.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously the President has made his views known about who he wants to see succeed him in office.\xc2\xa0 I think that is based on not only a personal relationship with Secretary Clinton, but also the President\xe2\x80\x99s experience working in the Oval Office, sitting behind that desk, leading this country and facing down the challenges that he\xe2\x80\x99s faced on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you just take a couple of examples, one is the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic record -- that we have a choice in this country whether to continue the progress we\'ve made over the past seven years.\xc2\xa0 That progress includes the longest stretch of private sector job growth our country has ever seen.\xc2\xa0 That\'s probably a statistic that a lot of people in this room would have laughed at me -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t work here in 2009, but if the person who was here made that argument in 2009, I think you guys would have been rightfully suspicious of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, April, the unemployment rate has been cut by more than half and now stands at 4.7 percent, again, reaching that level far sooner than expected.\xc2\xa0 Manufacturing has added 832 [thousand] jobs over the past 75 months.\xc2\xa0 This is the fastest streak of manufacturing jobs since the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 Rising home prices have brought millions of homeowners back above water.\xc2\xa0 Health care prices have risen at the lowest rate in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 The budget deficit has been cut by nearly three-quarters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President has made a lot of progress over the past seven years.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to mention what we\'ve done in climate change.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to mention what we\'ve done in housing, on reducing the deficit, on a whole host of other areas.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to be done.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s why the President is so focused on this upcoming race.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So with all of that, all of these successes, we\'re about a month out or so from the Democratic convention.\xc2\xa0 And has the President begun to write or tell his staff what the key components that you already know -- the key components of his speech, what it will be?\xc2\xa0 And is it going to be an easy speech since you are able to tout so easily what he has accomplished, his successes, when he goes into Philadelphia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on our speechwriting process for the convention.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that generally this is a responsibility the President takes seriously; that he\xe2\x80\x99s not only President of the United States, he\xe2\x80\x99s the leader of the Democratic Party, so he wants to make sure this convention is as successful as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think that those of you who accompanied the President on this past trip got a preview of the argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be making.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how similar the text of the remarks will be to what we gave earlier this past weekend to what he\'ll speak to in Philadelphia, but I do think thematically, the President has a strong record.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of and one he wants to continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would also note I saw that Leader McConnell was on the TV this weekend and could not articulate any comfortability with his party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\xc2\xa0 He could not state that his party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee was qualified to be President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Yet Leader McConnell is the Senate architect of their strategy to hold open a seat on the highest court in the land for him to fill.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask them how they square those two positions.\xc2\xa0 But we often talk about cynicism in Washington, and I can\'t think of anything more cynical than what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re saying that right now, today, June 27th, the outline for the speech for next month is pretty much somewhat laid already -- because he kind of gave it this weekend -- kind of started this weekend?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 What I was trying to say, April, is that the argument that the President will make on the campaign trail are some of the arguments you\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean the main --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I understand -- are arguments you\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard.\xc2\xa0 The convention speech is obviously a cut above in terms of importance and in terms of prominence, mostly because of the attention that will be paid to that speech.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have an update on where we are in the speechwriting process.\xc2\xa0 Obviously when speeches are of this importance, the President spends a lot of time on them.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t be surprised if he\xe2\x80\x99s already engaged in the process.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have an update in terms of where the drafts are.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, do you have any reaction to the Supreme Court decision on the gun rights case today, and does that figure at all into the debate that\'s going on on gun rights?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw that decision.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'re pleased with it, that it\'s consistent with the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in that case.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of any sort of discernable impact it would have on the debate in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Again, I, unfortunately, saw Leader McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on John\xe2\x80\x99s network this weekend where he said when asked about this issue that it\'s time to move on.\xc2\xa0 It\'s time to move on from doing something on gun safety.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the families of the 49 killed in Orlando think it\'s time to move on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that the families of the children in Newtown think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to move on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m not sure why Leader McConnell said that, but it seems to me that when you can\'t even take common-sense steps to prevent gun violence -- like making sure that those who our homeland security officials have deemed too dangerous to board a flight, making sure those people can\'t also -- can\'t buy a firearm -- if you are not even able to tackle an issues that is so sensical sensible as that, then I don\'t know why you\'re here.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know why you were sent to Washington.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that enjoys bipartisan support amongst Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also an issue that makes common sense, and it\'s also an issues supported by our national security experts -- our homeland security experts.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I know that Leader McConnell said he wants to move on.\xc2\xa0 But we hope he revisits that decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry if this has already been asked, but do you have any reaction to TransCanada suing over the rejection of the Keystone pipeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Pam, I did see that.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t comment on pending litigation or arbitration.\xc2\xa0 But I do know that Secretary Kerry has -- well, the State Department spoke to this over the weekend and basically what they reiterated is that last November, Secretary Kerry determined that the Keystone XL pipeline did not serve the national interest.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re confident that this determination is entirely consistent with all of our domestic and international obligations, including the obligations under NAFTA. And we\'re confident that will be upheld.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Change of topic.\xc2\xa0 The leader of Hezbollah made a rather drastic statement during the weekend that they receive funds and weapons from Iran.\xc2\xa0 While it is not new, does this shock you that actually he\xe2\x80\x99s coming straightforward and confessing that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking all their money from the Iranian government?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nadia, I can\'t get into intelligence matters, but we have called on all those who fund Hezbollah to stop doing so.\xc2\xa0 We know that Iran supports terrorism, and we know that Iran supports Hezbollah.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we\'ve issued the most serious and most severe sanctions ever on Iran for doing so. So it\'s important for them to recognize their own behavior in enabling this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'ve had a conversation recently about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about access to international markets.\xc2\xa0 Well, those financial actors are looking at Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 And if Iran is going to continue to fund terrorism and continue to supply resources to Hezbollah, that is going to have impact.\xc2\xa0 Those financial actors don\'t want to do business with a country that\'s doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we call on Iran to not only stop doing this because it\'s not good for national security and they\xe2\x80\x99re supporting terrorism, but we call on Iran to stop doing it because it\'s not in their interest either.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he also said that they don\'t need the banking system, that the money that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting from the Iranians are already going to them, whether it\'s cash or other methods, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So in this case, you have little leverage in terms of what money has reached them through the banking system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that\'s true, Nadia.\xc2\xa0 We are going to continue to use all the tools at our disposal, including sanctions, to target this group that we have, of course, designated as a foreign terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 We believe our designations over the past year designating Hezbollah procurement networks, financial and commercial front companies and other entities have been highly effective.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions regime passed earlier this year further builds on that and has created a climate throughout the world where financial institutions are rejecting Hezbollah from their institutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut your point is well taken that if Iran is going to continue to support Hezbollah, Hezbollah is going to continue to have a funding stream and resources.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why it\'s all the more important that if Iran wants access to international markets they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to curb their own behavior.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJulianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President put out a paper statement on the Texas abortion case this morning, but I\'m wondering if you could just address the significance of the ruling.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As the President said, he was pleased that the Supreme Court issued a ruling protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and their ability to make decisions on their health.\xc2\xa0 This is an opinion that was consistent with not only what the Solicitor General argued in front of the Court, but it\'s also consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s values on a position that he\xe2\x80\x99s been articulating since day one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur bottom line is that a decision on women\xe2\x80\x99s health should be made by that particular woman.\xc2\xa0 And this is an individual, private matter and one that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subject to government intrusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How significant would you say --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that obviously the President believes that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to make this decision free from interference from the government is a important principle for this President, but also one that\'s been upheld by the Court in the past.\xc2\xa0 So we are pleased by today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 We think it\'s an important one in that it underscores the reproductive freedom of women across the country.\xc2\xa0 We believe that government should not intrude on these most private family matters, and that women should be able to make their own choices about their body and health care.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on the question about the rescheduling of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- is it possible because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel schedule that the President might not actually reschedule the event with Hillary Clinton and would appear at the convention with her instead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard that contemplated.\xc2\xa0 I think they will be hitting the campaign trail together.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just unable to offer you a new date for when that\'s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 But as I said, the President is eager to get out there and campaign for Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 He thinks he has a forceful case to make and he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to making that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you might know, today former Senator Brown, as a surrogate for Donald Trump, today was suggesting that Senator Warren could clear up questions about her Indian heritage if she took a DNA test.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to that suggestion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 On Zika funding, I know that the Senate is going to try to defeat that bill the White House -- you said that the President would veto it.\xc2\xa0 How do we get to a bill that the President can sign quickly?\xc2\xa0 What is your best-case scenario for moving forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a very good question, and I think the answer is that House Republicans stop playing games; that they unfortunately have turned a public health emergency into a political football, and that\'s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 Again, we talk a lot about the cynicism in Washington, and to walk away from the negotiating table so that Democrats can\'t even sign off on a bill isn\'t leadership.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a weakness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, like we\'ve talked about, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even look like the Senate could pass the bill.\xc2\xa0 So if presented with the bill, the President would veto it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to outline why.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not even clear that this could pass muster in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, our principal concerns about the bill come in four baskets.\xc2\xa0 One, it\'s woefully inadequate.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s request was for $1.9 billion, but it\'s even misleading to call it the President\xe2\x80\x99s request.\xc2\xa0 This was a document and calculations put together by our public health professionals who determined that this would be the adequate funding needed to take on this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, it steals money from other critically important public health priorities, like funding the Affordable Care Act and funding the effort against Ebola.\xc2\xa0 We have personnel I think from the CDC on the ground right now in West Africa working on prevention, working on making sure another outbreak doesn\xe2\x80\x99t occur.\xc2\xa0 I think it would be grossly irresponsible to take them off the job.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if House Republicans have figured that out, but maybe they should spend some time thinking about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThird, the bill includes an ideological rider blocking access to contraception for women in the United States, including women in Puerto Rico, even though this is a sexually transmitted disease.\xc2\xa0 That, again, makes zero sense, especially since we\'re already seeing transmission in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then, lastly, this is a bill that contains an ideological rider to gut the provisions in clean water regulations.\xc2\xa0 Again, makes no sense.\xc2\xa0 Also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong intelligence bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we call on Republicans to get serious about this, and we hope they get to work soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re willing to wait then.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We absolutely don\'t want to wait.\xc2\xa0 And let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 We submitted a proposal in February.\xc2\xa0 It was put together and drafted by our public health professionals that outlined in detail what resources the federal government needed. So nobody in the White House is waiting.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we have deployed as many resources as possible that we can do on our own. We have reprogrammed some of the money that was allocated for Ebola in order to combat this threat.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been clear that we can\'t do this alone.\xc2\xa0 This is going to require congressional action.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we requested the $1.9 billion, and that\'s why we think Congress should get to work in passing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tA few things that are not being funded right now because of Republican intransigence -- if you just look at the state of Florida, money is needed right now in the state of Florida because mosquito control, which is a central element of the efforts to combat the virus, are spotty and underfunded.\xc2\xa0 The battle to squash the virus began months ago in Florida, but over two dozen local governments in Florida are collectively seeking millions of dollars to stop the threat.\xc2\xa0 The state of Florida alone needs to hire more inspectors, buy more insecticide, lay more mosquito traps, and conduct a more effective public information campaign on this.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re unable to do so because they don\'t have the funding.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t know how the House delegation in Florida -- how hard they\xe2\x80\x99re working on this, but it seems to me that if their junior senator has stepped up to the plate to say that Florida and the United States deserves this funding, it seems to me like those House Republicans maybe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have acquiesced to the Speaker who passed a bill that does almost nothing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 There are some U.S. firms that put down roots in the UK, hoping to gain and keep access to EU markets.\xc2\xa0 They are understandably concerned now.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a plan to help them?\xc2\xa0 Or do they assume a certain amount of risk and they have to live with it now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 My understanding, Olivier -- and I don\'t know if you\'re talking about specific contracts --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, there\xe2\x80\x99s some PhRMA, there\xe2\x80\x99s some financial services that put down pretty considerable -- they invested a fair amount.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So my understanding is that existing contracts will remain legally binding.\xc2\xa0 But if you have specific questions about specific contracts, I\'d obviously refer you to the company that\'s in question.\xc2\xa0 But my understanding is, generally speaking, most of these will be legally binding.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s some talk that the UK\xe2\x80\x99s eventual withdrawal from the EU, if that happens, will weaken the consensus on sanctions against Russia.\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you about that?\xc2\xa0 And overall, do you think the Brexit vote was a victory for Vladimir Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s been some public speculation on this, but our view is we don\'t expect the UK\xe2\x80\x99s referendum to have any impact on the rollover of sanctions against Russia.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this was talked about recently at the G7 in Japan, where some of you accompanied the President to. Since the start of the crisis in Ukraine, the United States, the EU and the G7 have worked in close cooperation to develop a set of sanctions that have had a deep impact on the Russian economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our understanding is those will roll over.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, United States officials will be working on that in the coming weeks and months.\xc2\xa0 But again, all of the G7 partners in Japan issued a commitment that the sanctions will stay in place unless Russia decides to start to abide by the Minsk agreements. If they start to abide by those agreements, those sanctions can start to be rolled back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo President Putin has a choice to make.\xc2\xa0 He can either continue down this path, which has been harmful for the Russian economy -- as I mentioned, the Russian economy has contracted about one-sixth.\xc2\xa0 It\'s smaller than the Spanish economy right now.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a direct result of a number of factors, but it\'s hard to ignore the impact of the sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Again, these weren\xe2\x80\x99t just bilateral sanctions put in place with the United States, they were sanctions that, thanks to the American leadership around the world, a whole host of international partners did so as well.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the sanctions have had such impact.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, on Friday, Defense Department reported in media reports as saying the Pentagon would lift the ban on open transgender service in coming weeks after -- agreement on the issue.\xc2\xa0 Was the White House involved in getting agreement to go forward?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I saw those reports.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have official reaction from the White House on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that\'s a decision made by our Defense Department officials.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have any updates for you on that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But like aren\xe2\x80\x99t you pleased that there\xe2\x80\x99s greater -- a move towards greater inclusion in the military?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has actually spoken to this.\xc2\xa0 He was at -- he spoke recently at the Air Force commencement.\xc2\xa0 And he was deeply moved by not only the caliber of the cadets, but also the diversity of the class.\xc2\xa0 He saw openly gay students.\xc2\xa0 He saw Muslim Americans, Hispanic Americans.\xc2\xa0 He saw women graduate who would soon serve in combat.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken quite frequently about the inclusivity of our military and how that is a strength and helps make our military the greatest in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that would apply to transgender troops, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re asking about a specific policy decision made by our Defense Department officials.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t want to get ahead of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton marched yesterday in New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Pride, despite having complications with a Secretary Service detail.\xc2\xa0 Did the President miss an opportunity by not participating in a Pride parade during his administration, especially to make -- at the same time to coincide with designating the national monument in honor of the Stonewall riots?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you brought up the national monument that was announced over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on this issue is well known.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, under his administration, don\'t ask, don\'t tell was repealed; the Defense of Marriage Act was rejected; insurance companies now can\'t discriminate based on who you love, and gay marriage is the law of the land.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on this strong.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one he\xe2\x80\x99s enormously proud of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the history at Stonewall is well known.\xc2\xa0 In 1969, a few bar patrons resisted arrest.\xc2\xa0 That resistance led to protest; that protest led to a movement.\xc2\xa0 And that movement led to enormous progress towards equality.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut like you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting, the fight isn\xe2\x80\x99t over.\xc2\xa0 And the President is acutely aware of that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s worked hard on this, and that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an issue that\'s always important to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, concerning the President\xe2\x80\x99s record and his views, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he make an appearance to -- at the Pride celebration\xc2\xa0 -- to announce the designation of the national monument?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was enormously proud to announce that designation earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we were coming back from Seattle on Saturday morning.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have any second-guessing to do on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s record speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 And he was enormously proud to designate this monument over the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Brexit for just a second.\xc2\xa0 We\'re sort of awash in the minutia of what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening.\xc2\xa0 But for the average American, should they be concerned?\xc2\xa0 If so, why?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important for the average American to realize that this was a decision for the British people, and the British people have spoken.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a decision in the United States that we respect.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s also important for average people to understand that the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom remains, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a bedrock of U.S. security and foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Likewise, the European Union remains an indispensable partner of the United States in stimulating economic growth and addressing regional and global challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the UK and the EU begin the process of negotiating the UK\xe2\x80\x99s departure, we\'re going to continue our robust work both in London and in Brussels and in other EU capitals to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity both in Europe and all over the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So based on that, the average American has nothing to be concerned about or to fear based on the UK\xe2\x80\x99s independent decision to leave the EU?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that as Secretary Lew said earlier today, and as other financial experts have attested, that there are now safeguards in place in a lot of these systems -- international systems and European banks -- that buttress their resilience to be able to deal with market fluctuations or headwinds.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if you\'re worried about what comes next, I think you are absolutely right to raise the question because we are going to continue to work closely with London and with Brussels and our international partners.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of this process between the UK and the EU to figure out.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to remain engaged.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to make sure that this is an orderly process.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our expectation.\xc2\xa0 But it also seems to be a goal that\'s shared by both the UK and the EU.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the reason I ask the question is because you have Secretaries Kerry and Lew out there, and Advisor Rice out there. You have a cadre of heavy hitters out there responding to this.\xc2\xa0 And so I think people wonder if that\'s the viewpoint, if that\'s the way the White House is handling this, should we all be a little bit more concerned about it -- as opposed to, oh, that\'s just a vote over there.\xc2\xa0 Do you understand my meaning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I hesitate to bring up the</p>\n<p>\n\tcounterfactual, but I have a feeling that if our administration weren\xe2\x80\x99t out there responding, you could imagine the questions we\xe2\x80\x99d be getting for why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we responding to this.\xc2\xa0 I think that Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s travel and comments on this, Secretary Lew\xe2\x80\x99s comments on this, our National Security Advisor, Susan Rice were making important comments.\xc2\xa0 And I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to communicate with the American people what our view is, what we think the consequences are of this decision.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re going to continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about what seems to be a bit of a standoff between the White House and the House Select Committee on Benghazi over whether the President should answer questions, a series of questions about the 2012 terrorist attack that left four Americans dead.\xc2\xa0 We understand that Counsel to the President Neil Eggleston feels like the questions were inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, as an American, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President want to explain not just what was happening that night, where he was, what was happening directly as it relates to his evening, but also why not answer more specific questions about it in the interest of transparency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure, Kevin.\xc2\xa0 Today -- I looked this up -- it is the 781st day of this committee.\xc2\xa0 This a committee that has gone on longer than the 9/11 Commission, than the committee designated to look at Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President Kennedy, the Iran-Contra Affair, and Watergate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not longer than the studying of the pipeline through Canada.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was lasted about 2,000 days or something, right?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Look, the problem is this is not the first committee to look into this, right?\xc2\xa0 This has gone on for a couple years now.\xc2\xa0 But the investigations into this attack started moments after the attack.\xc2\xa0 This is actually not the second or third committee to look into this, this is the eighth. This is the eighth.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have been investigating this exhaustively.\xc2\xa0 And with each turn of the crank, they\'re unable to prove some of the wild conspiracy theories they\'ve been proffering for years.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that Republicans want to look at every possible crevice for a new conspiracy.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, when they do so, they come up with nothing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if you\'re wondering where the President was that night, there\xe2\x80\x99s an easy place to find out.\xc2\xa0 On the White House Flickr feed we actually released a photo image of what the President was doing, and he was getting briefed by his White House team on the attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I know Republicans don\'t want to believe that photo.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they think it was Photoshopped.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they think it was fake.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s 100 percent authentic.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a question we answered years ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you\'re asking about our cooperation with this committee, it is far-ranging.\xc2\xa0 We at the White House -- just the White House produced nearly 1,500 pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 The State Department produced 100,000 pages.\xc2\xa0 State Department officials sat down for 53 transcribed interviews.\xc2\xa0 The Defense Department sat down for 24 transcribed interviews, sent over a thousand pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice sent over 84 intelligence products.\xc2\xa0 The CIA produced 10,000 pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 The Director of National Intelligence has produced 429 documents.\xc2\xa0 And none of that includes the previous seven committees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t know why Republicans are obsessed with this.\xc2\xa0 But given the other priorities that we\'ve been talking about -- Zika funding.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t even mentioned Puerto Rico, cybersecurity, criminal justice reform -- given all of the other priorities pending right now before Congress, common-sense measures to combat gun violence, maybe they should get to work on something they can have actual impact on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 The President, in comments to a DCCC fundraiser on Friday, didn\'t really mention the sit-in over at the House.\xc2\xa0 That was a bit of a surprise, to be honest, because the Democrats seemed to be making a big deal.\xc2\xa0 Is it because the White House sort of wants to distance itself from that sort of sit-in, that protest?\xc2\xa0 Or does the White House simply feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that should be used to proffer in political ads and that sort of thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 The answer is not at all, Kevin.\xc2\xa0 Everyone at the White House, including the President, was hugely supportive of Congressman Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on this.\xc2\xa0 The President sent out a tweet as a small gesture of support.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on this and views on this are well known. My colleague, Josh Earnest, spoke of the Senate vote as a \xe2\x80\x9cshameful display of cowardice\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 House Republicans have found an even new low.\xc2\xa0 They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even call for a vote.\xc2\xa0 It was a humiliating moment for Republican House leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the Speaker believes that, again, someone who is too dangerous to board a plane ought to be able to purchase a firearm, he should go ahead and make a floor speech and call the yeas and nays. \xc2\xa0He should have the vote.\xc2\xa0 He should make the case.\xc2\xa0 If he believes that not everyone should be subject to background checks before purchasing a firearm, make the case.\xc2\xa0 Have a speech.\xc2\xa0 Call the vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI looked up that 85 percent of the people of Wisconsin believe in universal background checks.\xc2\xa0 He should have to answer for that.\xc2\xa0 His caucus should be accountable for what they believe.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one more question about the Brexit.\xc2\xa0 You told --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the Treasury Secretary was confident the UK has the tools to promote stability there.\xc2\xa0 Just looking at the global markets, it looks like about $2 trillion has been wiped out just since the vote.\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any concern by the administration that this action in the UK could either undo some of the progress that the administration feels it\xe2\x80\x99s made since the 2008 financial crisis, or what they think the long-term impact will be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re right, we have seen volatility in the markets.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t mean to dismiss that.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about is Secretary Lew and his team determining that the UK and other policymakers around Europe are well prepared and have the tools necessary to support economic and financial stability over the long term.\xc2\xa0 The European financial system\xe2\x80\x99s resilience has significantly improved in recent years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are in close contact with our G7 and other international counterparts, and we\'re going to continue to consult and cooperate as appropriate.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw a joint statement from G7 released in the wake of the vote.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to that statement, which also expressed confidence in the resilience of the systems in place.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that we\'ve seen progress, and we\'ve seen more safeguards built into the system since that crisis.\xc2\xa0 So I think that speaks to why Secretary Lew made those comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve also talked about the respect that the President and the administration has for the British people\xe2\x80\x99s vote on this referendum.\xc2\xa0 Some people, though, have been calling for maybe a second round of voting.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that that would be a mistake to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCULTZ:\xc2\xa0 John, like you said, we respect the vote that happened on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 The British people have spoken.\xc2\xa0 I know that the British ambassador to the U.S. was on TV over the weekend, and he talked about this being irrevocable.\xc2\xa0 So, clearly, that\'s their position.\xc2\xa0 I know that Chancellor Merkel earlier today said she deals with facts, and the facts are this is what the British people voted for.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m going to stick in that camp, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one final question, following up on Kevin\'s line on Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 Some of the questions that have kind of been, I guess, a signal that the committee had in their questionnaire, a written questionnaire, seem pretty straightforward.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I see what the counselor\'s advice was.\xc2\xa0 But just as far as the question, the administration said that the President got briefed around 5:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 The attacks started at 3:42 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Was that briefing, would you say, was that the first that he had learned about the attack?\xc2\xa0 Somebody must have said, hey, this attack happened, we\'re going to do a briefing in 20 minutes or whatever, right?\xc2\xa0 So how did he first learn of the attack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 John, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a tick-tock of the President\'s schedule from September 11th, 2012.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you that Republicans continue to try and muster and fabricate and manufacture fake conspiracies about this.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s views on this were not only articulated in the wake of the attack, but the President -- we released details -- we released photo imagery of the President from that evening.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve also seen Republicans investigate this exhaustively.\xc2\xa0 It was the former House Speaker-in-waiting who admitted that this was all a political exercise.\xc2\xa0 He said -- what everyone knew in private, he said in public -- which is the Benghazi Select Committee was a committee designated to bring down Hillary Clinton\'s poll numbers.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s not pretend this is on the level.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'ve got Republicans who previously investigated this, who found, based on their own investigations -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t Democrats, this is House Chairman Mike Rogers, a renowned and respected Republican who no longer serves in the House, but was renowned and respected when he was there -- he said, "After reviewing hundreds of pages of raw intelligence, as well an open-source information, it was clear that between the time when the attacks occurred and when the administration, through Ambassador Susan Rice, appeared on the Sunday talk shows, intelligence analysts and policymakers received a stream piecemeal intelligence regarding the identities and affiliations and motivations of the attackers, as well as the level of planning and coordination.\xc2\xa0 Much of the intelligence was conflicting.\xc2\xa0 And two years later, intelligence gaps remain."\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the aftermath of its own intensive investigation, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a majority reported that the interagency coordination on the talking points followed the normal but rushed coordination procedure, and that there were no efforts by the White House or executive branch entities to cover up facts or make alterations for political purposes.\xc2\xa0 So this is a Republican conspiracy theory in search of a conspiracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CBC is reporting that President Obama is preparing, as part of the North American Leaders Summit, to pledge that the U.S. would obtain half of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2025, which would be an extremely ambitious pledge.\xc2\xa0 It would be more ambitious than not only what we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to do, but what even Hillary Clinton has sought to do.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on whether that\xe2\x80\x99s accurate and what the President\'s plans are regarding that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t preview any announcements that will be made in Ottawa on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 I can say that we do ambitious well, here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 So I know that my colleagues will be having a call later this afternoon to talk about the contours of the summit and what the President hopes to achieve there.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of any announcements that are associated with the North American Leaders Summit, I\'m going to let the leaders announce those up there.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, on the agenda is a host of issues.\xc2\xa0 That includes trade, obviously between the three nations -- 500 million people and billions of dollars -- sorry, 500 million people are the consumer base between the three countries.\xc2\xa0 And billions of dollars exchange hands every day because of trade between our three countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the North American region is and will continue to be an economic powerhouse.\xc2\xa0 I also expect the President and his counterparts to discuss border crossings, border security.\xc2\xa0 I think you can expect the conversation to include -- to extend beyond economic interests, but also cooperating on efforts to tackle transnational organized crime, battle infectious disease outbreaks like Ebola and Zika, alleviate poverty and inequality, expand refugee protection and assistance, and combat the effects of climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\'m going to stop there and let my colleagues handle the rest.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, the Turks and the Israelis announced they were normalizing relations today.\xc2\xa0 I just had a small question.\xc2\xa0 I was curious why, when the Prime Minister of Israel called, he spoke with Vice President Biden instead of the President, who has obviously been involved in encouraging this rapprochement also.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new calls from the President to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But if that changes, we\'ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 I am happy to respond to the news and say that the President is pleased that Israel and Turkey have agreed to restore diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 The United States welcomes this important step in improving relations between two key partners in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we believe this will open up new opportunities for cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the governments of Israel and Turkey will have more to say, considering this was an agreement reached between the two of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, yes, I know that Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with the Vice President, and Prime Minister Netanyahu also met with Secretary Kerry on this.\xc2\xa0 And we believe it\'s an important milestone.\xc2\xa0 We believe there\'s important security and economic benefits for both countries and the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the Vice President particularly involved?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know he\'s spoken to the Prime Minister about this, too.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that something he\'s taken on that would explain the phone call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 You should check in with the Vice President\'s office if there is specific engagement they\'re able to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But obviously this is something that the President and the Vice President and the entire administration welcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tLauren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to this Supreme Court decision on abortion.\xc2\xa0 The pro-life folks say that the reason that the law was put -- and the restrictions were put into play was to force clinics to meet hospital-like standards, saying that the ruling would open the door to more Kermit Gosnells, who is the jailed Pennsylvania abortion provider who killed women and injured women.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House say to that argument?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 So I guess for the specific legal arguments, I would refer you to our Solicitor General\'s brief and oral arguments.\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, in this case, though, we believe that a woman\'s right to make decisions about her reproductive health is sacrosanct.\xc2\xa0 And those decisions should not be subject to government intrusion, and that any obstacle in the path of a woman\'s reproductive freedom is unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 We remain strongly committed to the protection of women\'s health, including protecting women\'s access to safe, affordable health care, and her right to determine her own future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think it\'s important to note that, broadly speaking, if you\'ll just look at data, it\'s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows in this country.\xc2\xa0 This administration has, in fact, worked to ensure that every woman has access to the health care she needs.\xc2\xa0 This includes signing the Affordable Care Act into law and ensuring that women can\'t be charged more just because they are women for health insurance.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act has also led 20 million more people getting covered, putting the uninsured rate in single digits for the first time on record.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the protections in place for women and women\'s health in the Affordable Care Act were important to this President, and that\'s why he\'s spoken out so often on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Zika, why not compromise?\xc2\xa0 Everybody talks about Ronald Reagan and Tip O\'Neill, and the old era where people got things done.\xc2\xa0 And here you have the President saying $1 billion is just not enough.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Because a compromise between Tip O\'Neill and Ronald Reagan suggests that this is a partisan issue.\xc2\xa0 This is a public health emergency.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a Democratic cause to help protect women and unborn children from birth defects.\xc2\xa0 This should be something that actually enjoys bipartisan support in Congress.\xc2\xa0 This one shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be complicated.\xc2\xa0 This one shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be partisan.\xc2\xa0 This one shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ideological.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\'re so profoundly disappointed that House Republicans just threw up their arms, walked away from the negotiating table, and now we\'re on vacation.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Turning back to Europe and the aftermath of Brexit, you\'ve seen a lot of movements spawn in the wake of the Brexit vote.\xc2\xa0 There\'s Brexit, Grexit, Swexit, and Chexit -- (laughter) -- all of these countries who have movements --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Can you say that five times fast?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear that.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have an opinion on this mounting movement of exits from the European Union from countries other than Britain?\xc2\xa0 And I might add, recent polls show, for example, in France, more than 60 percent of voters want an exit, and in Greece it\'s over 70 percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 John, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President offer comment about these other countries contemplating that.\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to those nations if they have views or how they\'re working through that, or even to the EU.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, earlier, every nation is working through globalization trends, and every nation needs to tackle that -- because, again, our world is smaller than ever before.\xc2\xa0 We are a more interconnected global economy.\xc2\xa0 Our security is more linked than ever before.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it\'s important to not ignore these trends, but actually work through them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President\'s record -- some of the data I spoke of before -- is really strong on this.\xc2\xa0 We brought back the U.S. manufacturing industry.\xc2\xa0 We brought back the U.S. auto manufacturing industry.\xc2\xa0 We have put in place policies that have enabled a steep decline in the unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something we feel proud of.\xc2\xa0 Wages are starting to go up, not at the pace that we\'d like; we want to do more around that.\xc2\xa0 But these are all issues that every country has to work out itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also believe, as I mentioned, there are going to be impulses to retreat and to cower.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that, for the United States, that\'s not only not in our interest, it\'s a betrayal of our values.\xc2\xa0 We are a nation founded on basic freedoms.\xc2\xa0 We are a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 Our diversity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make us weaker, it makes us stronger.\xc2\xa0 It\'s fundamental to the fabric of who were are.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a defining characteristic for the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I spoke earlier of how deeply moved the President was of the class at the United States Air Force Academy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not just a snapshot of the U.S. military, it\'s a picture of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And again, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make us weaker, it actually makes us the strongest nation on Earth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Now, one other thing, though.\xc2\xa0 It would seem from you say, then, that he would not look kindly on movements like this that would break up the union that is the European Union.\xc2\xa0 Can I assume that from your remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You can assume that in the month leading up to the vote that occurred last Thursday, the President had the opportunity to weigh in on that decision.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he also made clear at every instance he spoke of that this was a decision by the British people.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, he wanted it to go the other way.\xc2\xa0 But the British people have spoken.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him articulate views about other countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing was, there were polls showing that many Britons -- more Britons than not said they would vote "leave" because of the President\'s remarks that \xe2\x80\x9cremain\xe2\x80\x9d -- that there was a backlash to it.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen any of the polls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have not.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s my understanding that Prime Minister Cameron at the time expressed great gratitude for the President making his views known.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Cameron and his team expressed those comments privately to us, but also, I think, they said so in public.\xc2\xa0 The other thing I\'ll add is that the President decided to weigh in not only because he thought this was in the best interest of the United Kingdom, but it was in the United States\' best interest; that there\'s a number of reasons why the United States\' interests are advanced when a strong United Kingdom is in a strong EU.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President made the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJared, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Eric.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to take another stab at John\'s question about a reversal on Brexit.\xc2\xa0 You said that you were dealing with facts, but you also said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We try to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, sure.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve also said that you hoped for a different outcome.\xc2\xa0 This is a reflection of the will of the people, but there are many parts that come up in the next two years that aren\xe2\x80\x99t referendum-controlled -- a new government formed after Prime Minister Cameron steps down; the Article 50 process writ large the negotiation with the EU -- the potential avenues for something different to happen.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration at all hopeful that one of those paths will lead to some kind of reversal of the will of the people that was expressed that last week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that contemplated.\xc2\xa0 Our view is that the British people have spoken.\xc2\xa0 This was a decision for the British people.\xc2\xa0 Their ambassador said over the weekend that this was irrevocable.\xc2\xa0 And so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anything to the contrary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last year, after the shooting at the Oregon Community College, the President used language that was perhaps the most political he\'s gotten about gun violence.\xc2\xa0 He talked about the need to politicize these issues.\xc2\xa0 And most specifically, he talked about that voters should use this as a single-issue lens, a litmus test for who they decide to support, and that he would be using it for candidates that he would support on the campaign trail himself.\xc2\xa0 Of all the things that the President has said, the many instances he\'s spoken out since Orlando, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said that.\xc2\xa0 Josh has said it from the podium, but the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said it.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder why.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He absolutely stands by that pledge, and let me tell you why.\xc2\xa0 He believes that Congress should take the common-sense steps to prevent gun violence.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve listed a couple already today.\xc2\xa0 That includes universal background checks. That includes making sure the people who are deemed too dangerous to board a flight not be able to purchase a firearm.\xc2\xa0 That includes making sure our ATF has the resources they need to enforce the current laws on the books.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a current talking point.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an ever-growing talking point by the Republicans on this, yet they\'ve done nothing to make sure that ATF has those 200 additional staffers.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that we\'ve asked for that Republicans have declined to move on.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President wants Congress to move on all those things. But to your point, he\'s acutely aware of the politics.\xc2\xa0 He\'s acutely aware of the realities of Congress right now, and none of those are likely to move with this particular Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he has called for a national debate on this, and that\'s why he\'s leading by example.\xc2\xa0 He has said he will not campaign for, he will not fundraise for, and he will not support candidates who don\xe2\x80\x99t support these common-sense measures to reduce gun violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President is acutely aware of the politics, and that\'s why he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said that this should be a litmus test issue since Orlando?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Oh, Jared, I think the President has spoken up quite frequently in light of Orlando.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the last two weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has spoken up quite unequivocally about the need for our politics to change on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect the President more or less as we get nearer to the election to say that this should be a litmus test issue for voters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think the President spoke of this at some of the political events over the weekend, so I do think he\'ll be making the case on this --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In public?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 In public and in private.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, all.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
