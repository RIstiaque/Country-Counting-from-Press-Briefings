GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will do two quick announcements before we get to one other topic.\xc2\xa0 Normally we do -- as you all know, at the end of the last Friday of every month we have been doing the\xc2\xa0 look-back WAVES requests, before starting the policy at the beginning of the year.\xc2\xa0 So that would normally have been the Friday after Thanksgiving.\xc2\xa0 We instead will, the next couple hours, release the October requests for pre-September 15th WAVES information.\xc2\xa0 So that will come over the threshold in a couple of hours, so nobody was stuck having to do this on Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many names is it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sixteen hundred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The second piece of information -- the President will address the nation on Tuesday at 8:00 p.m. from the Military Academy at West Point, on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So that is your second tidbit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s going to be the press --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are just at the very beginning of logistics on that, so we will -- I will make sure that Katie Lillie et al get information out quickly on that.</p>\n<p>Third, the President will travel -- as you all know, on December 10th will be in Oslo; December 9th, will stop in Copenhagen, around the climate change conference there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have with us today Mike Froman and Carol Browner to walk through the efforts that the President has been undertaking recently, particularly on his trip to China.\xc2\xa0 And Carol can go over some of our domestic efforts as it relates to clean energy and climate change that have happened over the course of the past year -- to walk us through a little of this announcement.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Well, as you -- as we\'ve talked about before, you know the President has helped reestablish American leadership on the climate change issue through a number of actions this year.\xc2\xa0 He relaunched in March the Major Economies Forum, which has met several times -- six times, I believe,\xc2\xa0 plus, at the summit level in L\'Aquila, Italy; and have worked through a number of issues related to the U.N. negotiations around mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance; in addition -- with a meeting during the summer, there was a major step forward with a number of provisions of a statement that developing and developed countries agreed to that helped move the ball forward on the Copenhagen negotiations, including developing countries agreeing to take significant mitigation actions and agreeing to a peak here and agreeing to take actions that would create a significant deviation from business as usual.</p>\n<p>This fall at Pittsburgh at the G20 summit, again under the President\'s leadership we agreed to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, which has a significant impact on greenhouse gases, somewhere between 10 and 12 percent reduction of global greenhouse gases in 2050, which is, as you know, is about 20 percent of the overall target of a 50 percent reduction.\xc2\xa0 So a significant step forward.\xc2\xa0 And at APEC two weeks ago, the APEC countries embraced that commitment as well, and so it\'s been further internationalized.</p>\n<p>In China, the President made some significant progress with the Chinese leadership on climate change -- it\'s reflected in the joint statement -- a number of steps forward there, including with regard to full transparency as to the implementation of commitments, a commitment to take significant mitigation actions and to stand behind those commitments.</p>\n<p>And yesterday here with Prime Minister Singh, he made further progress with the Indian leadership as well on climate change, also reflected in the joint statement.</p>\n<p>Based on all of those developments and on the recent progress he made the decision that it made sense to go to Copenhagen, as Robert said, on the 9th, to give momentum to the negotiations there.</p>\n<p>In addition to the President -- and we\'ll be putting out I guess a release later this morning -- there will be a number of Cabinet officers who will be participating in various parts of the Copenhagen negotiations and making presentations there, and you\'ll see the details of that in the press release later this morning.</p>\n<p>At this point, with two weeks left before Copenhagen, the focus is on how to create an accord that has immediate operational effect and covers all the major areas of the negotiation.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a comprehensive accord that can get a quick start at dealing with the climate change issues.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working very closely with Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark, the chairman of the conference, and his team toward that end, and we\'ll be working with other countries as well to maximize the chances that the negotiations can make progress towards an accord in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>At this point, it\'s critical that all countries, all major economies come forward with their mitigation actions -- and Carol will have more to say about that -- to maximize the chance of progress in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, the President believes that the foundation of a successful international agreement has to begin with domestic actions.\xc2\xa0 And in that vein, from the first day in office we have sought to take aggressive actions towards a clean energy economy and to put a cap, or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n<p>The Recovery Act was the first significant step in that direction, $80 billion in clean energy investments that are rolling out across the country.\xc2\xa0 We have proposed the first-ever greenhouse gas and the toughest fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks.\xc2\xa0 Congress said get to 35 miles per gallon in 2020; we have proposed 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016.\xc2\xa0 We have promulgated rules to promote the development of offshore wind and energy.\xc2\xa0 And the Department of Energy has set aggressive new energy appliance standards and continues to move forward on setting more standards.</p>\n<p>Now as the Copenhagen meeting comes into view, and based on the progress that we have made, as Mike spoke to, in the last couple of days and weeks, and in the context of an overall deal in Copenhagen that includes robust mitigation contributions from China and the other emerging economies, the President is prepared to put on the table a U.S. emissions reduction target in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels in 2020, and ultimately in line with the final U.S. domestic energy and climate legislation.</p>\n<p>In light of the President\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you repeat that again?\xc2\xa0 That\'s a lot of detail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 There\'s more detail coming.\xc2\xa0 Okay, it\'s in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels in 2020, and ultimately in line with the final legislation, U.S. legislation.\xc2\xa0 As you are aware --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By 2020, you would reduce it --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 -- 17 percent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the Waxman-Markey level?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re saying is in the range of 17 percent.\xc2\xa0 Waxman-Markey, as you all are aware, passed 17 percent.\xc2\xa0 The debate is not completed yet in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 When the debate is fully completed then we will adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p>Let me give you the rest of the numbers so you see the whole thing, okay?\xc2\xa0 I know they\'re just dying to -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Here comes a lot of numbers.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 A lot.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll read really slow.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>In light of the President\'s goal to reduce emissions 83 percent by 2050, the expected pathway set forth in pending legislation would entail a 30 percent reduction below 2005 levels in 2025, and a 42 percent reduction below 2005 levels in 2030.</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 There will be a test on this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me do that again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The poor guys trying to find the symbol function on their BlackBerry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 You have to go to the second set of symbol functions to do that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Okay, we\'ll do it again.\xc2\xa0 In light of the President\'s goal to reduce emissions 83 percent by 2050 -- okay, 83 by 2050 -- the expected pathway set forth in pending legislation would entail a 30 percent reduction below \'05 levels by 2025.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Both the Senate and the House bills include interim measurements.\xc2\xa0 They\'re slightly different, but they\'re fairly similar.\xc2\xa0 So it would entail a 30 percent reduction below \'05 levels in 2025, and a 42 percent reduction below \'05 levels in 2030.\xc2\xa0 Everybody got it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 83 percent is also measured against 2005?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s the G20 part adopted in L\'Aquila, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your larger point is that the House and Senate ranges are similar to what the President --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Right, the interim is out to 2050.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the House\'s is completed at 17 percent.\xc2\xa0 The Senate is still debating.\xc2\xa0 But when you look at the bills, what the House did and what\'s been in discussion in the Senate -- those interim measurements out to 2050.\xc2\xa0 In 2050 they\'re the same, and then in between they\'re fairly close.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just repeat that one more time, Carol?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 The whole thing?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have paper on it</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Eighty-three percent by 2050, which entails a 30 percent reduction below \'05 levels in 2025 -- it\'s all \'05 -- I\'ll make it simple for you guys.\xc2\xa0 It\'s all the baseline, okay?\xc2\xa0 So the 83/2050 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s 30 percent reduction --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 -- 30 percent in 2025, and 42 percent in 2030.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are those figures that he will propose, that you will propose in Copenhagen, that the U.S. will do?\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And again, on the 17 percent, just to be clear, it\'s in the range of 17 percent and we will obviously make adjustments when we complete the domestic legislative work.</p>\n<p>Let me just finish.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we now hope that other major economies are going to put forth ambitious actions of their own. We think those will be a necessary component of any accord in Copenhagen.\xc2\xa0 As I said at the beginning, we believe this is a very serious step.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we need to complete the domestic legislative agenda here.\xc2\xa0 We have been working hard to do that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already concluded work in the House, and we will continue to work in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What countries are you looking to that hopefully will commit as much as the U.S. is?</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think all major economies will need to make submissions as to what they\'re prepared to do for there to be an accord.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the starting point of the negotiations, or is this the max that this administration is willing to do, since obviously a lot of these other countries are coming forward with 1990 baselines that are going to be much more dramatic reductions?</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 This is the U.S. position on what we will be submitting in Copenhagen as to our commitment.\xc2\xa0 And as the President has always said, we want to make sure our international commitments very much follow in line with our domestic legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are these mitigation efforts the result of China and India?</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The decision to announce this, is it a result of mitigation efforts by both China and India?</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 It was based on that long list of actions that have been taken over the last nine months that have led to this point, but including over the last two weeks constructive discussions and progress we felt was made with them over climate change, and it\'s reflected in the joint statements both in Beijing and here yesterday.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And I think as well as the progress we\'ve made on domestic legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we interpret this as a prod to the Senate to get going on this early next year?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve had we think very good conversations with the Senate.\xc2\xa0 As you\'re aware, two committees have now acted.\xc2\xa0 Others are preparing to act.\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that you have a bipartisan group of senators -- Senator Kerry, Senator Graham, Senator Lieberman -- all announcing that they are working together, working with their partners, to craft leadership legislation is obviously something we find extremely encouraging.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you guys have consultations with any of the members of the -- of Congress before announcing these numbers?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 We\'re in -- I mean, we talk to members virtually every day about a whole list of things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, you told them about -- that these numbers were what you guys were putting on the table?</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been in close consultations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President do anything else besides this address?\xc2\xa0 Will there be bilaterals, multilaterals?</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 We are -- there\'s no schedule yet established.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working with the Danes to ensure that his visit there, his time there is maximally productive and gives maximum momentum to the ongoing negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this overnight in Oslo?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we have the itinerary yet.\xc2\xa0 Well, the 9th here and the 10th in Oslo.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t the slightest idea where we\'re spending the night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 9th here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In Copenhagen -- sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It will be just during the day, then, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\'s not an overnight in Copenhagen -- or we don\'t know?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We haven\'t picked a hotel yet.\xc2\xa0 We were focused on the target.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, on the 9th, will there be a number of other world leaders there?\xc2\xa0 Because it\'s a long summit and obviously there\'s going to be times when most of the leaders --</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking with the Danes, again, about how that day might be structured.\xc2\xa0 So we -- at this point we don\'t know what -- who else will be there or what the program will be at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you got any kind of ballgame estimate of what the economic impact of these targets would be?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the Waxman-Markey bill was scored by CBO prior to final passage, and for the average family of four, full implementation of the bill I think was about $173 a year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 20 --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 What was the year for the score in the CBO?\xc2\xa0 Do you remember?</p>\n<p>MS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s 2020.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 In 2020.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s your reaction to the British e-mails that have come out recently?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve read them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that I have a reaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Copenhagen talks are going from December 8th to the -- or 7th to the 20th -- 18th, something around that.\xc2\xa0 And 65 heads of state will be attending at the end.\xc2\xa0 Will the fact that Obama does not plan to be there make any agreement politically binding -- or a political agreement at that point less legitimate?</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think the President going to Copenhagen will give positive momentum to the negotiations, and we think will enhance the prospects for success.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who will go then at the end?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 We\'re releasing it today -- we have a whole delegation of Cabinet members and other top officials who will be in attendance throughout the conference.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Al Gore go?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 You\'d have to ask him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But not as part of the delegation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where he\'s spending the night, either.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 The U.S. delegation is made up of Cabinet members and senior White House officials, and we\'re releasing that list today.\xc2\xa0 Are we releasing when they\'ll be there, the main --</p>\n<p>MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they\'re coming at various different times throughout the two weeks, so you\'ll see all of that.\xc2\xa0 I think we have, what, six or seven Cabinet members going.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hate to back you up on this, but those e-mails -- I know they\'re controversial, but they\'re actually feeding the run-up to Copenhagen.\xc2\xa0 You might have read them, but you know basically the gist of them, which is being used by opponents of this deal to say that the whole thing is made up.\xc2\xa0 But you have to have more than just "I don\'t have any reaction."</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we\'ve all seen bits and pieces, we haven\'t seen the full e-mails.\xc2\xa0 But I think more importantly there has been for a very long time a very small group of people who continue to say this isn\'t a real problem, that we don\'t need to do anything.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, we have 2,500 of the world\'s foremost scientists who are in absolute agreement that this is a real problem and that we need to do something and we need to do something as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What am I going to do, side with the couple of naysayers out there, or the 2,500 scientists?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sticking with the 2,500 scientists.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these people have been studying this issue for a very, very long time, and agree that the problem is real.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect the President to outline an exit strategy in his speech?\xc2\xa0 And do you still want to engage the so-called moderate Taliban elements in this new strategy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get, again, far ahead of what the President will talk about on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I will say that throughout this process, the President has repeatedly pushed and prodded not simply for, as I\'ve said, how are we going to get a certain number of troops in, but what is their strategy -- what has to be implemented ultimately to get them out.\xc2\xa0 We are in year nine of our efforts in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to be there another eight or nine years -- which is why the -- a lot of the focus in these meetings has been on training for the Afghan security forces comprised of the army and the police; how do you ramp up this training as you are securing different areas that will ultimately be transferred back to the Afghans so that when that transfer occurs there is a security force that can keep the security gains that have been made.\xc2\xa0 That is imperative -- that is imperative in this strategy.\xc2\xa0 In terms of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President actually made up his mind on troop levels?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s not told me a final decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Hold on, hold on, let me address the second part of the question.\xc2\xa0 In terms of reintegration, I would point you to any number of statements that General Petraeus, Central Command, has made about efforts that are needed to reach out to elements throughout the population in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to ask his allies for more troops?\xc2\xa0 Because yesterday he seemed to emphasize the global fight against terrorism.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, first of all, there is a robust international force presently in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 This is not one country or one region of the world\'s problem alone.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that the national security team and the President will begin to talk to our allies about different parts of his decision as well as contributions that could be coming forward from them. I think you\'ve heard or seen the NATO Secretary General talk about this as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this what the President meant about finishing the job, ramping up security operations by Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 Is there a Taliban or al Qaeda component of finishing the job?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m going to let the President outline the fullness of his strategy and all of the components to it.\xc2\xa0 Our training of security forces is obviously one that is ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there\'s a report that the President on Tuesday will be meeting with 31 members of Congress who he previously met with in regard to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 And could you give us an idea of kind of the rollout, you know, the role of Cabinet members, et cetera?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, some of this obviously is still being finalized.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate the President will meet with members of Congress, just like he will talk to allies and others about the decision that he\'s made.\xc2\xa0 He did a similar meeting -- did a similar set of meetings earlier in the year around earlier decisions on Afghanistan and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know -- I have not seen a final list of who the members will be, but I do anticipate that he\'ll certainly brief members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the speech?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Before the speech, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- the second part of your question, in terms of -- I do not -- I have not seen a finalized schedule for testimony.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate -- again, we\'ve all watched this in -- happen a few times, particularly in Iraq, and I anticipate some -- the relevant committees will invite and testimony will occur.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a schedule on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear, Robert, on Tuesday the President will meet with members of Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Tuesday he will meet with members of Congress in the White House prior to traveling to West Point to deliver the speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you have any reaction to Speaker Pelosi\'s comments?\xc2\xa0 And more broadly, can you talk --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What are -- I didn\'t hear --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just that there\'s going to be, I think, unrest in the Democratic Caucus over this decision on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And more broadly, can you talk a little bit about what --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me give the -- let me let the President announce his decision before we -- I don\'t want to play the Jeopardy version of "unrest."\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but more broadly, can you talk a little bit about what you think the challenges are, in particular with the sort of communicating and convincing members of the President\'s own party on Capitol Hill, and more broadly in the country, on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this probably speaks for everybody in the country regardless of where you are in the political spectrum.\xc2\xa0 And this is what the President will do Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Again, we\'ve been here -- we\'ve been in -- we\'re in the 9th year of efforts in Afghanistan, right?\xc2\xa0 The American people are going to want to know why we\'re here.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to want to know what our interests are.\xc2\xa0 The President will want to walk through his decision-making process and give people a sense of the importance of our efforts, but reiterate for them that this is not -- this is not -- the President does not see this as an open-ended engagement.\xc2\xa0 Our time there will be limited, and I think that\'s important for people to understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he give a time frame?\xc2\xa0 Will he give a timeline?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want you guys to have something to write on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ll find something.</p>\n<p><br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t doubt that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say you\'re not going to be there for another eight or 10 years -- does that make sense -- I mean, the time --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, you should thank Mark for following up on his question.\xc2\xa0 No -- again, I don\'t want to get ahead of, again, what exactly the President is going to say.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would simply reiterate throughout these meetings you\'ve heard the President say this:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to be there forever.\xc2\xa0 We are -- it is unsustainable to think that, for any number of reasons: for the impact that it has on the thousands of men and women that serve, on the overall health of our force, on the sheer cost in monetary terms of what this means.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President has taken the time to meet with the national security team in order to get a strategy that gets this right, so that this can ultimately be handed off, and the responsibility for security of the Afghan country can rest and lie with the Afghans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with McChrystal before he announces it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Pardon me?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with General McChrystal in person before he announces --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We may have more on that later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, speaking of the cost, will the President actually in any degree explain to the American people how much it will cost, how much it will be -- how will it be paid for?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, guys, it\'s a billion dollars -- it\'s a million dollars a troop for a year.\xc2\xa0 It\'s -- 10,000 troops is $10 billion.\xc2\xa0 That\'s in addition to what we already spend in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 That also does not include training, and it doesn\'t include the maintenance of -- the maintaining of a security force.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very, very, very expensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there will be a supplemental?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to let the President make a decision before we go get the budget for the decision to implement what he does.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s -- again, I don\'t know what you guys would do on Tuesday if I just blurted it all out here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just a question -- so does the President lay that out to the American people?\xc2\xa0 Will he say --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just laid it out for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but I mean in that speech, will he actually say this is very, very, very expensive --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If Ben could show me that paragraph in his speech, I would have a better answer.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has throughout this process talked about the cost in terms of American lives and in terms of the cost to our Treasury, and I think he\'ll continue to talk about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, will the President be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- satisfied at this stage that his new effort will be received --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he feel fully satisfied at this stage that this new effort wouldn\'t be seen as --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Will not be seen?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will not be seen --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, another thing that we\'ve spent a lot of time working through is, with civilian and defense, is -- and as the President has said and as the President has told Karzai -- there has to be a new chapter in Afghan governance.\xc2\xa0 And that is something the President will talk about on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will it be cadets, military personnel?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cadet -- both?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, have you lined up television coverage yet?\xc2\xa0 Do we know that this is going to be carried by the networks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speak for the networks, but we have -- we talked to them yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President is reelected, are you basically saying the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Have a good Thanksgiving.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n10:37 A.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
