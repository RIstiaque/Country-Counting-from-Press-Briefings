Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:25 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the tardiness.\xc2\xa0 The last thing any of us would want to do is prolong this week.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to withhold any announcements and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go right to your questions, Darlene.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the White House is expecting out of the talks Secretary Kerry is having with his counterparts in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, as you pointed out, I believe Secretary Kerry recently concluded his conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov and several of their counterparts.\xc2\xa0 I believe Secretary Kerry said it was a constructive conversation where productive ideas were put forward.\xc2\xa0 I believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to meet again next week.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any further details beyond that readout and beyond the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment to reconvene next week</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this group the group that the White House would be looking to come up with a political transition in Syria that you all say is needed there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, if we take President Putin at his word, he is the one who said that a political transition is absolutely needed in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that the recent red carpet that was rolled out for Mr. Assad in Moscow was counterproductive to that goal.\xc2\xa0 This is someone who has used heinous chemical weapons against his own people.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s lost the legitimacy to lead.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s allowed his country to devolve into a sectarian civil war where extremists can flourish.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s also caused the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II.\xc2\xa0 So we do believe that Mr. Assad must go, and that is very high on Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any concerns about Russian lawmakers being in Syria today to meet with Assad just days after he went to Moscow to meet with Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report.\xc2\xa0 But as we have said, efforts to prop up Assad are not only counterproductive, but they\xe2\x80\x99re probably on the wrong side of history.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, can you preview a little bit the message the President is going to deliver this afternoon to the DNC Women\xe2\x80\x99s Forum?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have remarks to extensively preview for you at this time.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the President takes his role as head of the Democratic Party very seriously.\xc2\xa0 He has worked, as you all have observed, and traveled a lot of miles to make sure that our Democrats, whose names are on the ballot, which does not include him in 2016, have the resources they need to succeed and wage effective campaigns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think you can expect the President to make a pretty stark contrast between the economic vision that he\xe2\x80\x99s proffered for the past seven years, our record of accomplishment, and how Republicans want to roll a lot of that back.\xc2\xa0 That includes taking away health care from 17 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 That includes rolling back Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 And that also includes taking away the bold action this President has led on climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about the power plant regulations.\xc2\xa0 Twenty-four states today filed a petition to block the plan, as you no doubt know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how concerned is the White House that these challenges are going to delay or block implementation.\xc2\xa0 And what impact could the challenges and sort of the uncertainty surrounding the challenges have on the Paris talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, we are confident that this plan is on strong legal footing, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain why.\xc2\xa0 The Clean Power Plan is consistent with the text history and structure of the Clean Air Act, and it also gives the states the flexibility they need to implement it, and reflects unprecedented public engagement, and finally, is responsive to all of the feedback we receive from stakeholders during this very long engagement process.</p>\n<p>\n\tOverall, since you mentioned Paris, the President has made clear that we need to take bold action on climate change.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to his leadership, more than 150 countries have stepped forward and committed to reduce global carbon pollution, and work to slow the impacts we are seeing in terms of more extreme weather, impacts to public health, and the economic and national security interests at stake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how concerned is the White House that those countries and others will look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here with the court challenge and also with the efforts by lawmakers on a CRA to block the rule?\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House that other countries will look and that and go, well, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of uncertainty in the United States, why should we do something?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I am not surprised that our Republican critics have rushed to the courts to try and prevent something they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to do legislatively.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown an inclination to do on other issue areas.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that this approach has been shaped by data, shaped by science, and represents a balanced, pragmatic view of how to tackle this.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, our critics show up on the floor of the United States Senate with snowballs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seems to me that this is a plan that doubles down on flexibility and choices for states and utilities by mirroring the way energy production is already changing around the country.\xc2\xa0 This Clean Power Plan provides national consistency, accountability, and a level playing field, and again, really reflects our pragmatic and transparent approach to this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, can you preview for us what the President hopes to accomplish during his visit on Monday with Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s President?\xc2\xa0 Particularly when it comes to climate, is he looking for something concrete or additional from Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s President on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will welcome President Joko Widodo of Indonesia to the White House.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders will hold bilateral meetings in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 This will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s first visit to Washington since taking office.\xc2\xa0 And I do expect them to discuss climate.\xc2\xa0 We believe that this is, as two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracies, an area where the two countries can work together, as you point out, in advance of Paris.\xc2\xa0 I also expect them to discuss areas where they can expand cooperation, such as trade, such as defense, and pursue new areas of growth, like maritime cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if -- because there are a lot of American retirees down in Mexico and that coast, and because of the storm that is approaching there, what is the United States doing to reach out to Mexico now in preparation?\xc2\xa0 And what aid might it offer after the storm hits?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jim.\xc2\xa0 While it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear that Hurricane Patricia will make landfall in the United States, we are indeed closely monitoring the storm and are in close communication with the government of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 The State Department and USAID would be the lead agencies for any international request for assistance.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ll be point if and when those requests come in.\xc2\xa0 But I do know that the State Department has reached out to -- via our embassy in Mexico, reached out to any American citizens there with the appropriate warnings.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this something the two Presidents might talk about, as well?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect any kind of phone calls between them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any phone calls to preview at this point, but I can tell you that United States government officials are absolutely in touch with our counterparts in Mexico.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First I wanted to start with yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s testimony by Secretary Clinton in the Benghazi Committee.\xc2\xa0 Some congressional Democrats are talking about disbanding the committee after the hearing.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering both what your reaction to Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s testimony is, or if the President had a reaction?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, if you\'re supportive of the effort by some House Democrats to disband the committee.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 My reaction to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s testimony is that Leader McCarthy was proven right; that if you go back to when this committee was stood up by Republicans about two years ago, a lot of Democrats at the time charged that this was going to be a partisan exercise.\xc2\xa0 It took a little while but eventually leaders of the Republican caucus acknowledged the same thing.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday, if you review the videotape of 11 hours of testimony, you can be heartened by the fact that Leader McCarthy hit the nail on the head.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think Democrats should walk away from the committee?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that that was a question that was in play when Republicans stood up this committee about 532 days ago.\xc2\xa0 Democrats at the time were discussing whether their participation would lead credence to the committee or whether they should just not participate since it was going to be a partisan exercise.\xc2\xa0 So at the time, we deferred to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats to make that decision, and we would keep that same posture today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some congressional Republicans are saying that they don\'t believe Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s November 3rd deadline for the debt ceiling, and independent projections saying that it could be as much as a week later.\xc2\xa0 Orrin Hatch today in a letter asked the CBO for more guidance on this because Treasury is not giving them a day-to-day update on cash flows.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can say definitively whether the U.S. won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to meet all of its commitments on November 4th, and also if Treasury -- why Treasury isn\xe2\x80\x99t providing those day-to-day updates.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that Secretary Lew has made clear that extraordinary measures will be exhausted on Tuesday, November 3rd.\xc2\xa0 But I also want to be clear that given the volatility in this process and given the tens of millions of dollars the flow in and out of the government regularly, that if there is updates to those dates, Secretary Lew takes very seriously his responsibility to update Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then in his address earlier this week, Vice President Biden spoke about the moonshot to try to cure cancer.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could put any meat on the bone.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see a concrete legislative proposal out of the White House on this?\xc2\xa0 Is there a price tag involved?\xc2\xa0 Is this just sort of something that the Vice President threw out aspirationally, or this something that we\'re actually going to see you guys put forward?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what are the details on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I don\'t have a new policy proposal to unveil to you right now.\xc2\xa0 I would draw you to our Fiscal Year 2016 budget which does include significant investments in this area.\xc2\xa0 A lot of research is done specifically at the National Institutes of Health.\xc2\xa0 So I know that this President under this administration has increased significant the amount of funding for this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything new to announce in light of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in the Rose Garden yesterday [sic].</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a moonshot suggests kind of a new program of singular focus.\xc2\xa0 Even if you don\'t have the details now, are we going to hear something beyond kind of the regular budgetary ask on this?\xc2\xa0 Or was this not -- is this not actually something that\'s going to happen?\xc2\xa0 Kind of a unique and singular focus.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific, new policies or white paper to read out to you right now.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to curing cancer is matched in what he has asked Congress to fund.\xc2\xa0 And we can get you -- the Office of Management and Budget can get you the specific breakdowns, but I did have a chance to take a look at this yesterday and there has been a significant increase under this administration.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about Russia and its increasing role in the region, and in particular I want to ask you about what appears to be a new alliance with the Jordanians.\xc2\xa0 And when you add it all up, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s supposed partnership with the Iraqis, perhaps, to help fight ISIS, their continued support for the Assad regime in Syria and now this latest alliance with Jordan -- how concerned is the White House about Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s increasing role, and in particular this new alliance with Jordan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I saw news reports on that this morning.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to just back up and let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the overall context of where we were and where we are now.\xc2\xa0 If you take a look at, like you said, the region, Russia is a country that used to have two very reliable client states -- the Ukraine, which recently has flexed its independent muscle, and Syria, which is falling apart.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t look at this as a sign of strength by the Russians; we look at this as a sign of desperation -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost considerable influence in the region, and that puts aside the significant contracting their economy has done.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s now smaller than the economy of Spain.\xc2\xa0 And so we don\xe2\x80\x99t view this as any signs of strength by the Russians, but rather signs of weakness that they\xe2\x80\x99re losing influence in the region.\xc2\xa0 So it would follow that Mr. Putin would want to help prop up Mr. Assad.\xc2\xa0 We just think, as I said, that that\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong side of history.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about this partnership -- or budding partnership with the Jordanians?\xc2\xa0 Any concerns about that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to my friends at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I do know that the Jordanians are part of our anti-ISIL coalition.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve contributed significantly to that.\xc2\xa0 One of the touchstones for the President on building that coalition was to make sure we had a number of Arab states involved, so we appreciate the Jordanians\xe2\x80\x99 efforts on this.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department in terms of any specific communications we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And last, I want to just take you back to the hearing yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a great sense among many that it was political, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also the obvious -- people died.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be a number of people who are still concerned about the narrative that was coming from the administration in the hours thereafter.\xc2\xa0 New records show that Mrs. Clinton wrote within 24 hours of the attack that it was, in fact, al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 She told the Egyptian Prime Minister there was no connection to the film that we heard talked about a great deal yesterday and at that time.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, how do you square that with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s statements that we heard from the podium and other places?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, we had 11 hours of questions and answers along these very lines, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to mostly refer you to Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s responses on that.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that you are right that this was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0 Four Americans put their lives on the line to keep us safe and to advance the nation\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a very dangerous place.\xc2\xa0 They were killed on the line of duty on September 11th, 2012.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of discussion about that yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to watch the whole thing, but the parts I saw there was very limited conversation about that.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you in terms of the charge that you are mentioning -- that somehow talking points were politicized -- has been debunked time and time again.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence November 2014 report, which was signed by Mike Rogers, a well-respected member of Congress, a well-respected Republican, who wrote that the process used to develop the talking points was flawed -- a conclusion that we would absolutely agree to -- but that the talking points reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis.\xc2\xa0 This was a fluid time.\xc2\xa0 This was a difficult time where intelligence that we were receiving was conflicting and evolving, some of which turned out to be true, some of which, unfortunately, turned out to not be true.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is still no evidence to suggest that anything the administration did in talking about the attack was anything but based on the talking points and the guidance we received from the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t have to take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 The CIA has said just that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so to button it up -- and this is the last one I have.\xc2\xa0 Then is it your suggestion that her opinion in her conversations with others, that it was, in fact, al Qaeda -- even though that was not what was being said by the administration -- it was just her opinion?\xc2\xa0 Did she not get the same guidance?\xc2\xa0 Or did that guidance come out after or separately from what she was telling other people?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure out why they seem so divergent.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I think in your question, I think you got to it, which is the sequencing of this is difficult and it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\xc2\xa0 And at the time, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very fluid, difficult situation.\xc2\xa0 And our intelligence community is receiving intelligence in real time, and that is being vetted and looked at.\xc2\xa0 And then the administration in real time must answer questions from you and your colleagues.\xc2\xa0 So we were doing the best we could based on the intelligence that was coming in.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as my counterparts in the intelligence community will tell you, they were doing the best job they could.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pam.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, on the debt ceiling again, Kevin McCarthy said today that Republicans will demand spending cuts in any bill that avoids default.\xc2\xa0 Does that set up a situation where the government will wind up defaulting on the 4th?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I certainly hope not.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear and this White House has been clear that we\'re not going to negotiate over the debt limit, that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t asking Congress to do anything extraordinary or special.\xc2\xa0 This is asking the Congress to pay bills that it\xe2\x80\x99s already incurred.\xc2\xa0 And so this is something that we don\'t negotiate.\xc2\xa0 We urge them to do this immediately and without any drama or delay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would the President veto a bill that comes with these cuts on it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the House also, for the 50-somethingth time, passed a bill that would repeal a lot of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 If the day ends in Y.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you that if a Republican President takes over in 2017, that it actually will be repealed or changed dramatically?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are confident that a Democrat, we think, will take over the White House in 2017.\xc2\xa0 And if Republicans do win and choose to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they\'re not going to have to answer to us; they\'re going to have to answer the 17 million people they want to take health care away from.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As of June 30th, 9.9 million people were enrolled in the insurance marketplace for 2015 coverage.\xc2\xa0 The rate of health care increases is the lowest it\xe2\x80\x99s been in decades.\xc2\xa0 Over 13 million additional Americans were covered under Medicaid expansion and Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program.\xc2\xa0 Young adults are getting covered.\xc2\xa0 Hospitals are saving billions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 So we feel very good about our record on the Affordable Care Act, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be Republicans who have to answer why they want to take all that way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any update on states that may expand Medicaid now -- that there were some that looking at it?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any news on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have the latest state-by-state breakdown.\xc2\xa0 As I think you\'ve mentioned, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been heartened by the fact that a number of both Democratic and Republican-led state governments have decided that this is the right course of action.\xc2\xa0 That\'s obviously something we believe.\xc2\xa0 Our door is always open for anyone else who wants to do this.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any updates on the state-by-state breakdown.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks.\xc2\xa0 To follow up a little bit on yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the House Transportation Committee reported out a six-year transportation bill.\xc2\xa0 But the package isn\xe2\x80\x99t final and ready, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be by next week.\xc2\xa0 Will the White House veto a short-term funding patch for the highway bill?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, as you just alluded to, the Surface Transportation Authorization expires next week.\xc2\xa0 And I think the unfortunate reality is that due to congressional inaction, will need to pass another short-term extension of these authorities to keep federal funding for America\xe2\x80\x99s transportation systems.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President has said many times, that this country cannot continue to rely on short-term patches as an approach to funding our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 So the House and Senate should use this time to finally complete its work on a long-term bill like the one you mentioned.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he will support that then, just in order -- if they --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the unfortunate reality is that that\'s the only option at this time.\xc2\xa0 Republicans in Congress have chosen to use their time looking at other things.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anita.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the Benghazi hearing yesterday, I know that you were asked yesterday when I was not here, when I was over there --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We missed you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was there for 11 hours.\xc2\xa0 Somebody had asked you if the President watched, and at that point you had said you didn\'t know, or he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet, or it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on his plan.\xc2\xa0 Since it was 11 hours, and there was many hours of opportunity, I wonder if he did tune in, or if he saw anything later in the news reports, and also if he had a chance to call Secretary Clinton at all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Anita, I know that this was a seminal television moment for a lot of people in this room, and a lot of people elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 But we had a lot of business to do yesterday, so we were busy hard at work advancing the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.\xc2\xa0 I have not in truth spoken to the President about the hearing on Benghazi yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I am sure, given the ubiquitous coverage, he\xe2\x80\x99s seen a little bit of that, but I don\'t have any personal reaction or any communications -- or any conversations with Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t know either way if he called her?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Ron.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another Benghazi question.\xc2\xa0 Given 532 days of it --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s now the formation of a select committee to look at Planned Parenthood, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction is to that.\xc2\xa0 And following up the previous question about the Democratic role in this, would you advise -- or would the White House suggest that Democrats not participate in this?\xc2\xa0 Or what posture do you think they should take towards this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 In the Planned Parenthood?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think of all days for Republicans to stand up another select committee, they\xe2\x80\x99ve picked a very special one.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'re going to leave it to Democrats in the House of Representatives to decide if they want to participate.\xc2\xa0 That was our approach in May of 2014 when Speaker Boehner decided to stand up the Select Committee on Benghazi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying that because this is the day after Benghazi or because of something else then?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say because I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that yesterday you really gleaned a serious sense of purpose from Republicans who conducted that hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then you would suggest that this is the same thing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of participation, we\'re going to defer to the House Democratic leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Benghazi, as well, there were a number of recommendations that were made about embassy and consulate and other security at various outposts.\xc2\xa0 Are there specific things that you can tell the American public that have been done since that incident?\xc2\xa0 And is the White House now confident that -- I know you can\'t say that nothing like that will ever happen again -- but are you reasonably -- how confident are you that changes have been made that will prevent something like that from ever happening again?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, because in the wake of this tragedy the State Department did stand up an Accountability Review Board led by two of the most respected names and individuals in national security affairs.\xc2\xa0 And they developed -- they took a hard-nosed look at this.\xc2\xa0 I think anyone who has read the report will characterize it as unsparing.\xc2\xa0 And they came up with 29 recommendations.\xc2\xa0 The State Department committed to adopting all of them.\xc2\xa0 I believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve closed out on 26 of them, and there\xe2\x80\x99s three that are in process or near completion.\xc2\xa0 You should check in with the State Department for details on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a few examples of, like the ones you\'re asking about, they\xe2\x80\x99ve hired more security personnel and enhanced their training.\xc2\xa0 With congressional support, the department created or funded 151 new diplomatic security positions.\xc2\xa0 The department has procured new personal protective and breathing equipment for fire safety for high-threat and high-risk posts.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented the Vital Presence Validation Process, which articulates a very clear mission based on U.S. interests, and weighs the needs of U.S. foreign policies against the risks facing U.S. personnel.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve also expanded the Marine security guard program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 2012, Ron, Marines were at about 150 posts.\xc2\xa0 We have signed assigned detachments to 21 more posts, with 14 more scheduled in the coming months.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And despite all that\'s been said about this issue, is the administration much more -- or how would you describe the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view about embassy, consulate security now around the world, especially in hostile areas?\xc2\xa0 Is the administration more confident?\xc2\xa0 Are there still things that you want that you\'re not getting?\xc2\xa0 Where are we?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I would describe our concern for the safety of those serving in diplomatic posts as paramount.\xc2\xa0 These are men and women who oftentimes out of the limelight put their lives on risk.\xc2\xa0 They serve in places that are sometimes tranquil and sometimes very dangerous.\xc2\xa0 So that is something we are constantly looking at, and we are constantly evaluating security situations regionally and very locally.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You all have reported sometimes when the State Department issues an advisory or a security change -- level of change for an embassy or a post.\xc2\xa0 So I think that should be evidence to you that this is something we take seriously.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something we try and be very vigilant about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last quick one.\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to the family of Master Sergeant Wheeler?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, as I mentioned yesterday, our thoughts and prayers are with Master Sergeant Wheeler\xe2\x80\x99s family and friends and colleagues.\xc2\xa0 Our sincerest condolences go out to his family.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific calls to read out to you, but I know, broadly speaking, the administration has been in touch.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President would do or routinely does?\xc2\xa0 Routinely is a bad word, but does on these occasions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to preview for you, but I do know that we have been in touch.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the President extends his thoughts and prayers to his family.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related to that, Eric, the Pentagon described this as an enabling mission that went out to rescue these prisoners.\xc2\xa0 It happened, as you told us yesterday, without the President\xe2\x80\x99s direct sign-off.\xc2\xa0 The Defense Secretary was authorized to do that.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to recast the rhetoric about boots on the ground an actual threat or jeopardy that American military personnel are exposed to in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Because an enabling mission carries with it a sort of sense, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s maybe not dangerous.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it was.\xc2\xa0 It was fatal for this Master Sergeant.\xc2\xa0 There could be more enabling missions in the future.\xc2\xa0 There are boots on the ground, there are active military operations, and the United States is participating.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the American public deserve a clearer assessment of what the actual risks are and the fact that there could be more casualties of this kind in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Major, when the President laid out the rationale and the plan for Operation Inherent Resolve, he absolutely made clear that these men and women were going to be serving in a dangerous place; that they do, as you point out, put their lives on the line.\xc2\xa0 That this is not a safe place to be.\xc2\xa0 That when they assume these roles, there is inherent danger.\xc2\xa0 And like the operation that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, the loss of any American servicemember is tragic.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we offer our condolences to Master Sergeant Wheeler\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The operation that the President has authorized, known as Operation Inherent Resolve, is consistent with our goals to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The actual mission and operation that you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing that was authorized by the Secretary of Defense; that is consistent with our mission to train, advise and assist Iraqi forces under this very operation.\xc2\xa0 That mission is limited in scope, but does include supporting our partners on the ground.\xc2\xa0 This was a Peshmerga-led operation, which falls under the authorities of Operation Inherent Resolve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that this needs to be explained in any more clarity or precision about what actually U.S. military personnel might face on the ground in this operation or any other future operation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think the American get that it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous and somebody could die on an enabling mission when that sort of phraseology hadn\xe2\x80\x99t cropped up before?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I do think the President has made clear, and all of us who speak for the administration will continue to make clear that he does have no intention to authorize long-term, large-scale ground combat operation like our nation has conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a specific, narrow operation that the President has laid out for our engagement in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 And the specific operation that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about was authorized under Operation Inherent Resolve\xe2\x80\x99s mission to train, advise and assist Iraqi forces.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Samantha Power said yesterday, \xe2\x80\x9cSince Russia began its airstrikes, the Syrian map has shifted in ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that?\xc2\xa0 And how strategically important is that reality for the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated map or assessment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But your U.N. Ambassador said that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to defer to my counterpart at the United Nations, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment to offer you from here at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that there is no doubt that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Syria are counterproductive to its stated goal of wanting both a political transition and to attack ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re productive, she says, for ISIS.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 My point is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the strikes we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in total are not pursuing the goal that they stated.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We asked you this yesterday and you were reluctant to even weigh in on it.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration involved in any conversations about a one-year debt ceiling increase?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Our position on this --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know what your position is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 -- hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one day more dire, but our position is that the debt limit should be raised.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something you\xe2\x80\x99re open to?\xc2\xa0 And has that been in any way, shape, or form conveyed or proffered as a possible way out?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any guidance on that?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, our position is the debt limit should be raised.\xc2\xa0 And the reason we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to attach specifics and caveats and negotiate this is because it\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple proposition.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been done under Presidents of the Republican Party and Democrat Party.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you is if Republicans suggested that to you, and are you open to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re open to is the debt ceiling being raised, because that\xe2\x80\x99s their responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that leaves open a week, six months, a year?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything specific about this that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to if not embrace, at least acknowledge -- considering the gravity of the situation, which you apparently think is large.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I agree with that myself.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that the debt limit should be raised.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not even negotiating with our partners on the Hill, so it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard for me to negotiate with you because we believe that this should be done without negotiation, without drama, without delay.\xc2\xa0 Major, Speaker Boehner did this a couple times in past years without negotiating, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the same position we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have on this instance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing, on Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 It was suggested by some Democrats that a wider lens might have been more appropriate for the committee itself and for yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration supportive of a lens that is so wide that it brings in the former CIA director, David Petraeus, and ask questions about CIA operations in Benghazi and/or just the number of personnel there, what was their relationship to the State Department outpost in Benghazi, things of that nature?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 So in terms of the scope of this committee\xe2\x80\x99s investigation --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were some members who suggested that would be a productive line of questioning.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if you agree.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a position on where this committee should go from here.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, they\xe2\x80\x99ve lived up to Leader McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s view that this was a political instrument to take down the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of who they should interview from here and what other hearings they should have, it\xe2\x80\x99s seems like they\xe2\x80\x99ve had a pretty exhaustive try of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you deem that irrelevant, or something that would be counterproductive to an inquiry about Benghazi itself -- the tragedy and the things that can be learned from it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to just largely defer to members on this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s their inquiry, it\xe2\x80\x99s their investigation.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this particular one be politicized.\xc2\xa0 But if they have other people they want to interview, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be up to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the more than 500 days and $4 million and 11 hours of Clinton testimony, do you feel that there was anything good or positive or productive that came out of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I think we saw a former Obama administration official take seriously her responsibility to lead the Department of State.\xc2\xa0 I think we saw Democrats on this panel come to that hearing with a serious sense of purpose.\xc2\xa0 And I think we saw unfortunately a conversation that got politicized.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what about the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not so much talking about the kind of effect while Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was going on, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the investigation itself.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that there was anything productive or that we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from this particular investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Not really.\xc2\xa0 I think that, as Ron mentioned, in the wake of this tragedy, under Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, an Accountability Review Board was stood up, led by Ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mike Mullen, two public servants of renowned reputation.\xc2\xa0 They did a very deep dive on this.\xc2\xa0 They spent months and months interviewing State Department officials, leaving no stone unturned in their investigation.\xc2\xa0 They actually came up with 29 concrete recommendations to make sure our posts abroad were more secure, and to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again.</p>\n<p>\n\tI haven\'t seen such concrete or constructive recommendations from House Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think that this particular investigation that we\xe2\x80\x99re still seeing, it\xe2\x80\x99s a complete waste of time and money?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a political exercise, as the Majority Leader said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the latest poll that we had showed that 59 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way Secretary Clinton handled Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 So what do you think of what we saw yesterday -- what effect do you think that that could have on those numbers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave the political tea reading to all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact that that many Americans feel like there was something missing.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to square how you see it as -- there were deep dives before; this one went deeper.\xc2\xa0 Americans still feel dissatisfied over the subject in general.\xc2\xa0 Do you find any sense of maybe those two extremes meeting after this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 After the 11 hours of testimony?\xc2\xa0 Hopefully.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you my observation from yesterday, which I think anyone objectively looking at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s hearing will see a former Secretary of State who exhibited a deep sense of responsibility for what happened, a deep sense of responsibility for making sure our diplomats who serve abroad in dangerous places are protected, and someone who likes to hold herself accountable when things go wrong.\xc2\xa0 So those are some of the attributes of why the President selected Hillary Clinton in the first place, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of her record as Secretary of State.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say that a lesson has been learned here about talking points in general, though, on the part of the administration?\xc2\xa0 This in particular really publicly highlighted that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, almost every other question.\xc2\xa0 So the American public, if there was confusion over that before, over what was said when, now they get it.\xc2\xa0 So what would you say from the perspective of the administration on any lesson to be learned there on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by the premise of your question, which is half of an 11-hour hearing was dedicated to talking points.\xc2\xa0 That should tell you all you need to know about the value of the hearing.\xc2\xa0 But this has been something that\xe2\x80\x99s been -- I understand we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this eighth investigation, but the preceding seven looked at this too and they found no evidence of the Republican conspiracy theory that these talking points were politicized.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 In July 2011, the President said he would not negotiate the debt ceiling -- raising the debt ceiling limit.\xc2\xa0 He said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate with a gun to his head. And we ended up with quite an extensive negotiation, resulting in the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are going to look at that and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to listen to what you have said and what the President has said about absolutely no negotiation, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to say, well, they said that before.\xc2\xa0 So do you really mean it this time?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I would tell you that the President absolutely believes that raising the debt limit is the bare minimum that Congress can do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking them to do anything extraordinary or anything special.\xc2\xa0 They just need to pay the bills for a tab they\xe2\x80\x99ve already incurred.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we all go out to dinner at restaurants, we pay the bill -- that\xe2\x80\x99s all we\xe2\x80\x99re asking Congress to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly simple.\xc2\xa0 As you all -- and let me just be extra specific that raising the debt limit does not increase spending or authorize new spending.\xc2\xa0 All it does is pay bills that Congress themselves have already incurred.\xc2\xa0 So we do absolutely encourage Republicans to get their act together and figure out a way to do this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there will be no negotiation this time, despite the fact that that pledge has been broken in the past?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No negotiations, period.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99ll split the difference between a question that Cheryl asked earlier and Mike just asked now.\xc2\xa0 Because when she was asking about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in the right spot for that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It works out perfectly, and so I wonder what your answer will be.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You gave Cheryl an inch on transportation funding, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give Mike a mile on debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So in the other one on --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like those SAT questions -- if the train is leaving -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see how you do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Not well.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 December 11th, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got CR.\xc2\xa0 You described to Cheryl that it was the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 inaction and their inability to get more done that gives the President a loophole on transportation.\xc2\xa0 So will you give them the same pass -- so when it comes to a CR, could we see a short-term CR sign, despite the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise earlier that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President was clear, when he unfortunately had to sign the last CR, that Republicans and Democrats in Congress should take this time that was afforded to them to come up with a long-term spending bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was also clear about other spending as well.\xc2\xa0 And Cheryl talked about transportation.\xc2\xa0 So why is that special and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, as he said at the time, that this was the last CR short-term extension he was going to sign.\xc2\xa0 And he said that for a good reason, which is this country is experiencing tremendous, significant economic growth that includes the longest stretch of private sector job creation in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 And there is no reason why our friends at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue can\xe2\x80\x99t roll up their sleeves and figure out a way to fund the government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking them to do something that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly extraordinary or special or requires a whole lot of extra analysis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re asking them to keep the government open.\xc2\xa0 It should be fairly simple.\xc2\xa0 Republicans ran very hard in the last several midterm elections in order to have the responsibility to lead those chambers of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s part and parcel of that responsibility to keep the government funded.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it was your characterization that because of choices that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made, the President has to countenance signing a short-term or at least won\xe2\x80\x99t veto a short-term transportation.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that could possibly extend.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans continue to run out clocks on things like maybe a speaker election or a few other things that\xe2\x80\x99s going to eat up some time, is that going to apply to the CR negotiation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take place or has to take place in the next few weeks because that runs out on December 11th?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jared, the President was absolutely clear he is not going to sign another short-term CR.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President this morning named Brett McGurk as his new envoy for countering the Islamic State.\xc2\xa0 Is his brief to continue the work of General Allen, or should we expect some kind of change in tack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Change in?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Change in tack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you all received the written statement from the President earlier today, noting that General Allen has done an outstanding job with an enormously complex assignment.\xc2\xa0 He himself has built from scratch a robust international coalition that is undertaking a wide range of political, diplomatic, military, economy and other efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyone who has been fortunate enough to work with General Allen knows he is a true American patriot and one of our greatest leaders.\xc2\xa0 The President is very grateful that General Allen once again postponed his well-deserved retirement to build and lead our counter-ISIL coalition. As you know, this was initially supposed to be a six-month term.\xc2\xa0 He, due to a lot of arm-twisting, agreed to stay on for an extra six months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd by the same token, the President is very pleased to welcome Brett McGurk as the new Special Presidential Envoy.\xc2\xa0 Brett, as you point out, has served as General Allen\xe2\x80\x99s deputy since the beginning of this campaign and has long been one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted advisors on Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has also asked Brett to work closely with our national security team to strengthen our partnership with Iraq and work extensively with regional partners to bring an end to the civil war in Syria, which continues to fuel ISIL and other extremist groups.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given what you say about Brett McGurk -- I mean, his experience is in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He knows the tribes in Anbar.\xc2\xa0 He knows the country extremely well.\xc2\xa0 Should we take his appointment as a sign that the ISIL campaign will now be more focused on the Iraqi theater than it has been in the past year or so?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see that as a sign.\xc2\xa0 In fact, if you take a look at Brett McGurk\xe2\x80\x99s record, he has got a proven track record and is held in high esteem within our government, and with coalition partners across the world.\xc2\xa0 Over the last year, he\xe2\x80\x99s worked shoulder to shoulder with General Allen providing firm advice and a steady voice in the most senior meetings.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you point out, his precise specialty is Iraq, but he\xe2\x80\x99s spent a lot of time both in the region and studying it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is gratified he\xe2\x80\x99s going to accept this post.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a final question.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a position yet on whether Iran should face additional sanctions as a result of the ballistic missile test?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Andrew, I believe that this was brought up at the United Nations earlier this week from our ambassador, Samantha Powers.\xc2\xa0 I believe she submitted this resolution as a violation.\xc2\xa0 We firmly believe it is a violation.\xc2\xa0 But that process needs to work its way through the United Nations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A violation would mean more sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge the result of that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Goyal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as Prime Minister Sharif Nawaz of Pakistan visit was concerned, he was met with many demonstrators outside the White House, and also this morning at the USIP, from Balochistan.\xc2\xa0 They\'re talking about human rights and also that Nawaz Sharif was friend of Osama bin Laden and so forth in supporting terrorism in Pakistan against other countries, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the question is about the terrorism, human rights in Pakistan, and second, what he was saying, that -- almost every week there is a statement from Pakistan against India that their nuclear program is not as wedding gift, but it will be used against India someday or one day.\xc2\xa0 My question is here, human rights in Pakistan, and if and how much safe is their nuclear program from the terrorists?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Goyal.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, as you point out, President Obama did have the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Sharif.\xc2\xa0 They met for about an hour and a half in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 President Obama underscored that the United States is committed to a broad, sustainable, and enduring partnership with Pakistan that delivers progress for the Pakistani people and reinforces Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s democracy and civil society.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on terrorism, as you brought up, President Obama and Prime Minister Sharif both noted that our two countries are threatened by terrorist groups, and that the Pakistani people have suffered greatly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These leaders committed to continue bilateral counterterrorism cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama highlighted the importance of Pakistan undertaking effective action against terrorism -- against terrorists that seek to undermine peaceful dialogue and destabilize the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One piece that was important to the President is that Pakistan not discriminate against terrorist groups.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear in the past and was reiterated yesterday in the bilateral meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as Prime Minister Modi\xe2\x80\x99s visit was last month here at the White House and the United Nations, two senior senators from the Capitol Hill wrote a letter to the President for -- a resolution about 12 points they made -- Senator John Cornyn and also Senator Mark Warner.\xc2\xa0 One, if the President received this letter because they are seeking this resolution on U.S.-India Investment Treaty and also defense treaty among others.\xc2\xa0 And where do we stand now, as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned after the visit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Goyal, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that letter, so I don\'t know --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that letter so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that if it was addressed to the President we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s processed in turn.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President deeply values his relationship with Prime Minister Modi; that the United States and India have worked together very closely.\xc2\xa0 They have a strong partnership specifically on expanding economic opportunities.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something the President has worked hard on.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s directed his team here at the White House and throughout the administration to focus on our relationship there and seek opportunities to expand cooperation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Decker, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Interesting news this week on the Democratic front in terms of the race for the Democratic nomination, Lincoln Chafee dropped out of the race today.\xc2\xa0 Jim Webb dropped out earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 And we saw the announcement by Vice President Biden in the Rose Garden earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 Does it make it easier for the President to endorse Hillary Clinton much earlier in the process now that Vice President Biden has decided that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to run for President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 John, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s been a discussion of that here.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you the President actually addressed this question, I believe last week in the Rose Garden, when he said he\xe2\x80\x99s going to cast a ballot in the Illinois primary on the Democratic side for President.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s going to be up to him whether he wants to make that public of not in advance of casting that ballot.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he pleased that a former member of his administration is the clear frontrunner for the Democratic nomination?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s pleased that Democrats running to work here in the White House in 2016 are largely recognizing the record of this administration over the past seven years.\xc2\xa0 This is an administration that took the country from economic crisis to resurgence.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, we\'re proud of that record on the economy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re proud of our record strengthening relations around the world.\xc2\xa0 We\'re proud to extend health care to 16 million Americans and make sure those costs rise at the slowest rate in decades.\xc2\xa0 We\'re proud to institute new reforms governing banks on Wall Street to make sure that the financial crisis that this country had to endure in 2007 and 2008 never happens again.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s one final question for you.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a Friday afternoon question for you.\xc2\xa0 I, obviously, like others, had some time to kill while waiting for you to come out -- (laughter) -- and I was listening to the President\xe2\x80\x99s Spotify list.\xc2\xa0 I found an opportunity to listen to that.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m curious, with so much on his plate, both on the domestic front and the foreign policy front, how did he have the time to come up with that list?\xc2\xa0 Did he have some help in putting together that Spotify list?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that that was a project the President took very warmly to, and with great enthusiasm was excited to share his musical preferences with all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will attend Senator Daschle and Senator Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s lunch at the Metropolitan Club here in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday afternoon, the President, as we talked about, will welcome President Joko Widodo of Indonesia to the White House.\xc2\xa0 President Widodo will make his first visit to the United States since becoming President.\xc2\xa0 President Obama looks forward to charting with President Widodo a new phase of the U.S.-Indonesian partnership.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President will welcome the United States Women\xe2\x80\x99s National Soccer Team to the White House to honor the team in their victory in the 2015 FIFA Women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup.\xc2\xa0 The visit will continue the tradition begun by President Obama of honoring sports teams for their efforts to give back to their communities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon, the President will travel to Chicago to address the International Association of Chiefs of Police at the 122nd Annual IACP Conference.\xc2\xa0 The event is the largest gathering of law enforcement leaders in the world, with more than 14,000 public safety professionals attending.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Later in the day, the President will attend a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event and a Democratic National Committee event.\xc2\xa0 The President will remain in Chicago overnight and return to Washington on Wednesday, October 28th.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will be here in Washington, will participate in a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee roundtable event.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd on Friday, the President and First Lady will welcome local children and children of military families for one of our favorite events here at the White House, the annual Trick-or-Treat at the South Portico.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, guys.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:17 P.M.
