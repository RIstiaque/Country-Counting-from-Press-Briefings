(Local)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 As promised, Mike Froman is here to run through just some basics on the G20 for the next two days.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about what our plans are, what we\'ve done so far, and take some questions.\xc2\xa0 If you can sort of focus on the next two days while he\'s here, that would be helpful.\xc2\xa0 And I can help manage some of the Q&amp;A at the end if there are a lot of hands raised.\xc2\xa0 Thanks so much.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And this is on the record, pen and pad, so no cameras.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I know some of you are deep experts in the G20 and I imagine some of you are just getting into the issues for the first time, so why don\'t I give some context.\xc2\xa0 And then we can go as far or as deep as you like.</div> <div class="legacy-para">It\'s no surprise to anybody that we\'re gathering the G20 at a time of the most severe economic and financial crisis in generations.\xc2\xa0 These 20-plus countries represent about 85 percent of the global economy and they come together at a time when incomes are falling, unemployment is on the rise, trade has collapsed and financial markets are strained in all of their countries.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">To put this a bit in historical context, international cooperation at times of crises is very important.\xc2\xa0 Most people agree that the Depression was made great by the lack of cooperation, that the Latin American debt crisis of the \'80s lasted a decade in part because there was difficulty in formulating a common approach.\xc2\xa0 But historically, it\'s proven difficult to cooperate around international crises because nations controlled their own fiscal policies, their monetary policies were dependent on independent central banks, and their regulatory policies were shaped by their own culture and national traditions.\xc2\xa0 And if you look back at the history of summits, there have been very few examples of summits that have achieved significant gains in terms of international cooperation during times of crisis.</div> <div class="legacy-para">This has become all the most important now because of the interconnectedness of the economy now, of markets now, and of this crisis -- in particular, financial problems in one country spread quickly to others, and exports to all countries are dependent on the ability of demand in each country to rebound.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">There was a global economic summit here in London in 1933.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. President did not attend and the summit failed to provide what at the time was seen as good direction to try and get out of the Depression at the time.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The stakes for this summit are very high.\xc2\xa0 They are magnified by the fact that much has happened since the last G20 summit in November.\xc2\xa0 The last summit focused largely -- and importantly -- on a number of regulatory issues.\xc2\xa0 But the economy has declined in November and December, the crisis has spread, and the countries of the G20 have been focused on restoring demand and restoring growth.<br/> <br/>  And that really is the agenda here.\xc2\xa0 It\'s really two tracks: restoring growth, on one hand, and engaging in broad and deep regulatory and institutional reform on the other.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">On the restoring growth side, it\'s really a four-part program:\xc2\xa0 putting in place significant stimulus, fiscal and monetary; fixing the financial system to get lending going again; avoiding protectionism; and taking steps to minimize the spread of the crisis to emerging markets and developing countries by making sure that there are both the resources and the tools available at the international financial institutions.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">That\'s the first track, the restoring growth track.\xc2\xa0 The second track, which is equally important, equally urgent, is regulatory reform.\xc2\xa0 And here there will be a number -- there are a number of areas that have been worked on since November and a number of accomplishments that will be announced at the summit.\xc2\xa0 There is agreement, for example, to expand the scope of regulation to any institution, market, or product that\'s systemically important to the international financial system, and that could include hedge funds.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Secondly, there\'s an effort to encourage offshore financial centers or tax havens, to sign on to and implement a number of standards of international behavior and bring them into the regulatory environment.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Third, there will be work done on capital, and capital for financial institutions to make sure the capital requirements prevent crises like this from developing again, and once they do develop, don\'t make them worse.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Fourth, there will be a number of changes, as I mentioned, on the institutional front to encourage supervisors to work together from different countries to deal with cross-border issues and institutions that operate globally.\xc2\xa0 Also on the institutional side there will be the expansion of the Financial Stability Forum.\xc2\xa0 This is a group that had been largely -- well, it was largely the G7 before and it will now incorporate all of the G20.\xc2\xa0 And for the first time -- and this is really quite significant -- for the first time there\'s a recognition that the major emerging markets in developing countries have a critical role at the table in helping to manage the international financial system.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Related to that, there will be a big push for the reform of the international financial institutions, including giving greater voice and vote to emerging markets in developing countries and have those institutions reflect the reality of the current global economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Even before the leaders gather here on -- tomorrow night, it is important to note what\'s already been done.\xc2\xa0 Since November, as the economy declined in November and December, the G20 -- and I believe it\'s all G20 countries -- have either adopted or are in the process of adopting significant stimulus plans.\xc2\xa0 By some estimate, it reflects about 1.8 percent of GDP for this year.\xc2\xa0 It\'s about $2 trillion over -- $2.5 trillion over 2009 and 2010.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Each country has done so in their own way, but that coming together, that concerted action among the countries representing 85 percent of the global economy to adopt proactively stimulus measures is a remarkable development in international financial cooperation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Secondly, as you know, in November they agreed to resist efforts to -- resist protectionism and resist the erection of new trade barriers.\xc2\xa0 And while the record is not perfect, the general assessment is that since November, whatever barriers or whatever measures have been taken have not had a significant impact on global trade, and that countries are very much trying to comply with the spirit of that pledge.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Third, on the regulatory reform side, much progress has been made on the agenda I laid out -- as I mentioned, the Financial Stability Forum being expanded to all the G20 members.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at our own country, in the United States, on all these major elements of the program, the United States comes here obviously prepared to listen, but also to lead, and to lead by example.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">On stimulus, the President and Congress have adopted the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 On fixing the financial system, the Treasury Department has announced significant pieces of a financial stability plan.\xc2\xa0 On regulatory reform, Secretary Geithner laid out last week his proposals regarding systemic risk oversight.\xc2\xa0 And on protectionism, the President has stood firm in a number of instances about the importance of avoiding actions that would reduce trade.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So the U.S. comes here well positioned to talk about what we\'ve done, to talk with the other countries about what they are doing, and to fulfill what is really a remarkable agenda for international cooperation at a critical time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">It reflects a number of changes in the international system -- the fact that there\'s an agreement that the IMF should play a role on evaluating what\'s needed to restore growth in the international economy and to monitor what the countries are doing in that regard, and whether the G20 is doing enough to restore growth.</div> <div class="legacy-para">There\'s an element of accountability in every element of this program.\xc2\xa0 The IMF will be asked to monitor the stimulus efforts.\xc2\xa0 The WTO and others will be asked to monitor the anti-protectionism effort.\xc2\xa0 The Financial Stability Forum and others will be asked to monitor efforts to fix the financial systems in each of the countries.\xc2\xa0 So it is both a series of commitments, a series of actions, many of which have already been taken, and a series of steps looking forward to monitor what\'s going on and to be prepared and come back and take further action if necessary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Let me just mention a last point.\xc2\xa0 At the meeting of the G20 -- you\'re all aware that in addition to the leaders meeting there\'s an ongoing process of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors who meet regularly.\xc2\xa0 The most recent meeting was three weeks ago, I think, in Horsham, UK, where they issued a statement committing that they will all do what is necessary to restore growth; they will do it over a sustained effort -- they will have a sustained effort over a period of time in order to restore growth; and that they will agree to have the IMF monitor what\'s needed to restore growth in what each of them are doing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And it\'s that three-part commitment that gives us comfort that while all countries are taking action now and implementing their plans, there\'s an eye towards the future towards doing whatever is necessary until global growth is restored.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Why don\'t I stop there and am happy to take questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the offshore tax havens -- and you mentioned this on Saturday, there\'s going to be a communiqu\xc3\xa9 to encourage compliance with international standards.\xc2\xa0 Why not -- are there any tools in the toolbox to actually force compliance?\xc2\xa0 And does the G20 have anything available that they can clamp down on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 The G20 is looking at a number of different approaches to that.\xc2\xa0 When I say incentives for offshore financial centers to adopt and implement these rules, there are a number of things in the toolbox that might be available, and that\'s part of what\'s being discussed this week.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- incentives, carrots and sticks, or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, incentives.\xc2\xa0 I\'d just leave it at that, that there are ways of encouraging countries to adopt these standards.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, is the communiqu\xc3\xa9 going to try to do anything more than was done in November on trade?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you say the nations are living up to the spirit, but the WTO counts 17 of the G20 doing something that\'s protectionist -- 47 different instances of it.\xc2\xa0 Is this communiqu\xc3\xa9 going to try to be more robust in discouraging future acts of protectionism, considering the global scope of exports and how they\'ve declined and how that\'s hurting every member of the G20?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I think every -- I think all of the G20 are seized with the importance of avoiding steps that would further reduce or distort trade.\xc2\xa0 My sense is there will be a reaffirmation and perhaps an extension of that commitment, and perhaps a bolstering of the role of the WTO in monitoring the implementation of that commitment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Mike.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 Mike, could you talk about what French President Sarkozy said apparently today about being upset that the regulatory efforts that were going to come out of this were not strong enough?\xc2\xa0 And second, could you talk about the sense in some parts of Europe that the United States is to blame for this economic crisis, and how that dynamic could play out over the next couple of days?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen a specific comment from President Sarkozy, so I won\'t comment directly on it.\xc2\xa0 All I can say is we\'re working closely with all of the G20 on a robust regulatory reform agenda.\xc2\xa0 The President, by the way, has been personally involved in this.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the G20 preparation going back to the transition, when he first met with President Calderon, his meetings with Prime Minister Harper, with Prime Minister Aso, Lula, and then phone calls that he has had even in the last week with President Sarkozy, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Brown all around these issues.\xc2\xa0 And our impression from those phone calls and other interaction we\'ve had is that there\'s a great deal of consensus and agreement among the leaders and their teams on what\'s necessary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I\'m sorry -- your second question was about the U.S. blame?\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think President Obama has been fairly -- very open in sort of saying what he believes the causes of this crisis are and that some of them rest in the weakness of the regulatory environment in our own country, our gaps in regulation.\xc2\xa0 He talks about the era of irresponsibility.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think we are at all averse to having an open dialogue about the causes of this crisis.\xc2\xa0 The causes are many, they\'re not limited to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 But we -- we\'re not here to be defensive or to shirk any responsibility.</div> <div class="legacy-para">My sense is, is that the focus of this dialogue is much less around the causes of this crisis as it is about lessons to be learned from this crisis and how to prevent future crises -- how to manage this crisis and mitigate its impact on one hand, and how to prevent future crises like this from developing in the future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Tom.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting more progress this time than you thought you would have in November?\xc2\xa0 And how much sensitivity is there among the leaders to the fact that if the markets think you haven\'t accomplished much, there could be a complete tumble?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\'t here in November so it\'s hard for me to answer that first part.\xc2\xa0 I would just say that there was a robust work program that was launched in November, and progress has been made on a number of those items.\xc2\xa0 What\'s changed since then is that the crisis has -- the crisis over the course of November and December -- significantly deteriorated.\xc2\xa0 And so it has required a new and more proactive approach to managing the particular elements of this crisis, and that adds another dimension to the summit, which I think makes it a broader and deeper agenda.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of the market reaction, I think the leaders will do their best to come up with what they think are the most sensible approaches on all of these issues.\xc2\xa0 And my sense is that it will be a credible and legitimate package of steps both on the restoring-growth side and on the regulatory-reform side, and how the market reacts to that remains to be seen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Ann.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would appear that the G20, which is relatively new, because of the breadth of its membership, has really kind of now replaced the G8 as the major economic forum.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair assessment?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think there are different roles for different groupings of countries.\xc2\xa0 And the G20 at the leaders level is a new -- is a relatively new innovation.\xc2\xa0 It existed at the finance ministers and central bank level, I think, going back to the \'90s, and has been useful since as a forum for international cooperation.\xc2\xa0 I think every G has its value and -- (laughter) -- one can spend a lot of time debating what we affectionately called "Geometry," but I think at this point there\'s a role for the G8, there\'s a role --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for this crisis you need the 20 at the table.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not enough just to have the Western democracies, but for a crisis of this -- this breadth, you need all 20 of those countries.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think for the financial -- economic and financial crisis of this nature, having the major emerging markets and developing countries at the table is critical.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI: Jonathan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, could you talk a little bit about the bilateral meeting tomorrow with the Chinese and the Russian heads, and how much will -- how much OF that will be about economics and how much will be the much broader agenda?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this -- I am less involved in those bilaterals than others who are not here.\xc2\xa0 This will be the first meeting between the President and each of those leaders, first face-to-face meeting.\xc2\xa0 And our sense is that it will be a very broad agenda touching any number of issues -- economic, political, strategic, et cetera.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just elaborate on what you think that -- I mean, I know it\'s not your issue -- but what do you think the stakes are in both of those meetings?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'d rather not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\'re able to get Mike McFaul or Jeff Bader or somebody tomorrow around those, they\'re better --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You\'ll get many of those people to preview of what\'s to come.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 There you go.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Ed, did you have a question?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was going to ask about Russia, so I\'ll pass.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Rich.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of the communiqu\xc3\xa9 is still sort of up for grabs?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there anything that you -- since November you\'ve been working on this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering, is there anything that would surprise you, or are there any elements on protectionism or anything else that really do come down to the discussions on Thursday, as opposed to fait accompli?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think there is broad consensus on the principal planks of what will ultimately be reflected in the communiqu\xc3\xa9.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s a evolving process; 48 hours is a long time in this environment.\xc2\xa0 And of course when you get 20-plus leaders in a room, there\'s -- there is opportunity for additional dialogue that could have an effect, as well.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not locked down, but I think there is broad agreement and consensus around the basic parameters.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you -- just following on from Andrew\'s question, really, could you just explain how you think the G20 format has measured up, whether it\'s measured up to some of the expectations which were around a couple of months ago, whether they can approve -- where you are right now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if that\'s a better question to ask after the summit.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, sure, but --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I just think it\'s too early to tell.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have to see how the summit goes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but do you think it -- some people have said it\'s a very unwieldly format.\xc2\xa0 Have you felt it to be unwieldy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 We have a -- there are various channels of dialogue -- the finance ministers, there are deputies, the\xc2\xa0 central bank governors, there are sherpas -- so there\'s a lot of dialogue between the 20 countries or 20-plus countries to prepare for this meeting.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I wouldn\'t necessarily say it\'s cumbersome, but it is 20-plus countries, so it does take a certain degree of coordination. And I commend the British for having done a very good job of managing the preparatory process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a question coming back to the communiqu\xc3\xa9 once more.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you said before that no number was sacrosanct, but since you also said restoring growth is so important and so, I guess it\'s not irrelevant what numbers these are at the end of the day.\xc2\xa0 And so I was wondering if you could tell us what you\'re hoping for?\xc2\xa0 And also to follow up on the tax havens once more, what would you say to suggestions to publically name the tax havens?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think on the -- the question was about restoring growth, and the second was on tax havens.\xc2\xa0 On the restoring growth, what\'s important is that there is agreement to do whatever is necessary until growth is restored; there\'s agreement to take sustained effort until growth is restored; and there\'s agreement to ask the IMF to monitor both what\'s necessary and what\'s being done by the G20, and to report back on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">To us, those are the three key elements of the commitments around the fiscal stimulus.\xc2\xa0 And when I said no number was sacrosanct, it\'s because every country has adopted stimulus.\xc2\xa0 They\'re in the process of implementing it.\xc2\xa0 Every country is different and has more or less capacity to adopt stimulus.\xc2\xa0 And at this level, what\'s important is that just everybody commits to do whatever it takes until growth is restored.</div> <div class="legacy-para">On tax havens, I think it will -- this will get worked out over the next couple of days -- exactly how those incentives are created, including how countries are referred to.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One European argument is that they already have the welfare state the United States tried to become with the help of its stimulus package.\xc2\xa0 So the Europeans don\'t need this large welfare -- stimulus package.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about this argument?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Many European countries have automatic stabilizers that kick in times of downturn that help cushion the blow of an economic downturn, as do we in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Some of the ones in Europe are more generous than they are in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And when the IMF looks at the totality of what\'s been done, they look at both discretionary spending like a stimulus package and they look at it with automatic stabilizers.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So one can look at it in both ways and see what\'s been done to help stimulate demand and what further -- what might be done if growth is not restored.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Do you have any other questions?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Right back there.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Oh, sorry, didn\'t see you -- go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can IMF do if they find out the stimulus wasn\'t enough?\xc2\xa0 What can IMF do if they find out the stimulus of each country weren\'t enough?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 The IMF is providing an independent assessment of what\'s necessary to restore growth and what each country has done to stimulate their economy, and they will report back to the countries on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 It\'s up to the countries, each country, to decide from there what makes the most sense for itself to do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the IMF be making recommendations on these --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'d have to ask the IMF exactly how they\'ll reflect that in their report.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Anybody have any last questions while Mike is still with us?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the next G20 meeting?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 There\'s been no decision as to whether there will be another leaders meeting, and if so when or where.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on that point, though, I mean, do you regard it as important?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously you regard it as important that the process carries on -- is your official position that it might be helpful to have another leaders meeting in a year --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think the G20 at the leaders level has proven very helpful in terms of addressing particular elements of this economic and financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not it has a continuing role in that regard I think is up for the leaders to decide.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I just follow up on the discussion about fiscal stimulus?\xc2\xa0 You said you take comfort in the fact that the agreement will say that everyone agrees to do whatever is necessary -- but if you have countries like France and Germany that actually don\'t believe right now more stimulus is necessary because of the other problems it may cause, how does that give you comfort?\xc2\xa0 In other words, isn\'t it all in the definition of "whatever is necessary"?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, because I think nobody -- and this -- despite the back-and-forth in the press, nobody at any point had any expectation that countries would come to this meeting tomorrow and say, I\'m going to do another point of stimulus or I\'m going to do another two points of stimulus.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what these summits are about.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t a pledging conference.\xc2\xa0 This is --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about going forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 But that -- and that\'s my point, is that right now you\'re absolutely right, there is vigorous debate in Europe as to whether more stimulus is necessary or prudent.\xc2\xa0 And in our point of view, countries have done stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Those stimulus plans are still being implemented.\xc2\xa0 And all that\'s necessary from our perspective is, down the road, if growth is not restored, how will countries react in that instance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, thank you, Mike, for joining us.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get around the transcript to everybody as soon as we have that ready as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  3:42 P.M.
