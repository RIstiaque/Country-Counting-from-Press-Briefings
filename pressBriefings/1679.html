EST</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\'s going on, guys?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any opening statement at all?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that the administration has decided to give GM another $4 billion?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will double-check, but I believe that that is the case.\xc2\xa0 But let me emphasize that that was part of the original -- I believe that was part of the original agreement that was made at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We anticipate that later today the administration will receive the reports that Congress requires detailing restructuring plans for both of Chrysler and GM.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the administration looks forward to analyzing them, understanding that the auto companies represent a huge part of our manufacturing base, and to have a strong and viable auto industry is tremendously important for the future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the foreclosure plan, you probably don\'t want to give out too many details before tomorrow, but in putting together the plan, how did the President balance the need to address the problem of foreclosures without bailing out speculators or people who were irresponsible with how they access loans?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, without getting into proposal details which we\'ll have for you guys tomorrow, obviously, as the President spoke about throughout the campaign, bailing out speculators or those that were trying to game the system is not what this plan is going to try to do.\xc2\xa0 Instead it\'s to stem the rising tide of foreclosures, as well as people that are at risk for foreclosure based on the fact that their housing value has dropped as a result of this economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ten thousand people face foreclosure every day in this country.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s a problem that not only affects the individual homeowner and their family, but oftentimes has a direct impact to home values in the neighborhood that that house or homes are on.\xc2\xa0 This is a tremendously important part of what the President believes has to be done next in order to move our economy forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think today will represent a big step forward for a recovery -- for the Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, which will be signed into law, in beginning to move aid to families and states, and in long-term investments that will create jobs and put people back to work immediately.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, going back to the automakers, can the obviously enormous amount of restructuring that\'s going to be required take place without them going into bankruptcy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me not prejudge plans that have yet to be turned into the administration as required by actions that were taken at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are different paths that can be chosen and we\'re anxious to see what type of restructuring details each of the automakers themselves have put together in conjunction with their bond holders, their employees.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I just want to reiterate that it is tremendously important for our economy to have a strong and viable auto industry and that the cars of tomorrow are built in America for Americans.\xc2\xa0 So let me not prejudge their plans until we have a chance to look at them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Their plans aside, you -- the administration has not closed the door to a government-backed bankruptcy, though?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I wouldn\'t close the door -- I wouldn\'t preclude policy choices, particularly since we haven\'t seen details on what they think is ultimately going to be most helpful for them.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ve had teams of people working on this through the beginning of the transition and I think they\'re anxious and eager to see what type of details the companies will put forward today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President want to see an auto industry bankruptcy on his watch, though?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President of the United States wants to see a strong and vibrant auto industry that\'s employing tens of thousands of hardworking Americans, and building the cars of tomorrow for Americans right now.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what this President wants to see.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what are the prospects for another economic stimulus package following this one?\xc2\xa0 I mean, have you guys ruled out that you would do something of this -- another step of this significance?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I think we believe that the steps contained in this piece of legislation that the President will sign in a few hours will be the beginning of getting our economy back on track.\xc2\xa0 Whether it is creating jobs, creating -- or investing in our infrastructure, putting money directly into people\'s pockets, ensuring that states and localities don\'t have to lay off firefighters and teachers, represents a strong start toward economic viability.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And investments that are contained in this piece of legislation, some of which we\'ll showcase today in Denver, provide the foundation for sustained, long-term economic growth through investments that we\'ve neglected, quite frankly, over the past many years.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think we\'re anxious and eager to implement the plan that the President has called for, ensure that the money is given out in a transparent and accountable way, and that it creates and saves the jobs that we believe it will before we go any further on an additional stimulus bill.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President has spoken many times about the need for many other things to happen in this economy.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'re working on a financial stability plan to increase lending to small businesses and families.\xc2\xa0 The home foreclosure aspect is something the President will detail tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And then, most importantly -- and you\'ll hear him talk about all these things today -- or not most importantly, but as important is a plan to enforce the rules of the road so we don\'t find ourselves in this economic dead-end again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems like you\'re almost taking a wait-and-see kind of approach to this, but not closing the door to another step.\xc2\xa0 Would I be incorrect in interpreting it that way?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, without -- let me give you two answers.\xc2\xa0 One, the President is going to do whatever he thinks is necessary to get our economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look back at the -- well, in just four weeks since -- four weeks since the President was sworn into office, we\'re going to sign the largest economic recovery package in this country\'s history that will do many of the things that I\'ve enumerated -- most importantly, we think, save and create 3.5 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our focus, and I think there\'s obviously a lot of work to be done in ensuring that this money gets out quickly and gets into the hands that -- and in the hands of people that need it the most.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the President is going to do what\'s necessary to grow this economy.\xc2\xa0 But there are no particular plans at this point for a second stimulus package at the moment.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t foreclose it, but I wouldn\'t say, at the same time, there\'s -- we\'re readily making plans to do so.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, though, is it a fair read to say that if your economics team has any concern about this bill at all, it is that it is, in fact, too small, not a big enough pot to really stimulate the economy the way the President originally envisioned?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President originally envisioned a $675 billion to $775 billion plan, in meeting with his economic team in December, and I think today we\'re signing a $787.2-billion plan.\xc2\xa0 A little bit --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And $90 billion in tax cuts.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, tax cuts that will put money into people\'s pockets that we believe they\'ll spend on goods and services that will stimulate this economy.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that the framework of this bill is -- was done in a way that will stimulate economic growth, and that we\'ve landed on a size that will create jobs and get people back to work.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did he want to do this announcement in Denver?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Denver is lovely this time of year.\xc2\xa0 No, I think partly what you\'ll see today is we want to highlight -- we want to highlight specific things that are in the bill, particularly I think you\'ll see a company today that\'s likely to, under provisions in this bill, be able to expand its operation in clean energy jobs, not lay off people but instead hire people, and go many steps further in reducing our dependence on foreign oil at a time in which we have to desperately do so.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think today\'s event will encapsulate many of the things that we hope to get out of this recovery plan, which is incentives that will put people directly back to work, create and save jobs immediately, but also lay the path for sustained economic growth through important investments that will help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- I think that\'s a plan that the American people wanted; I think that\'s a plan that the President will sign into law today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President initially had some concerns about the appointment of Roland Burris by Rod Blagojevich.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if he has any reaction to the disclosure over the weekend that there were actually more extensive contacts than Burris initially let be known.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know whether we have or he has seen anything related to the affidavit.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Robert, Harold Ford\'s name has been bandied about for possible Commerce Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Is he under consideration?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you guys know that with the existence of this many microphones, I\'m very reticent to play the name game.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any sense, without playing the game, of how close you are to filling these key jobs, especially the Health and Human Services Secretary?\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got the budget coming up; health care reform is important to the President.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your time frame?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- obviously we\'re in the process of reviewing candidates for both of -- both very important jobs.\xc2\xa0 But let me say something as it relates to health care.\xc2\xa0 I think the steps that we\'re going to take today in signing this bill, in moving forward the very important provisions on medical technology that will sharply reduce paperwork that doctors have to produce, will speed up a system that otherwise is notoriously slow, and save people money in the process, is a great down payment on the type of reform that the President talked about throughout the campaign, and represents one of the biggest steps forward in reforming our health care system that this country has seen in quite some time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, as we seek to fill these important jobs, the President is taking steps in ensuring that reform of the health care system is moving forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When are you sending the budget up to Congress?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I\'m not mistaken, I think it goes up later next week.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I want to say the 26th, but I\'ll double-check on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s correct.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s the Thursday -- oh, look at that.\xc2\xa0 Five points for me.\xc2\xa0 Thursday after --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want to go for 10?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t want to -- I\'m not going to risk my winnings on double jeopardy on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s the financial conference, the joint speech to Congress, and then the budget?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate, honestly, that the joint session of Congress will focus heavily on a series of -- a series of things related to the economy.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he\'ll talk about the Recovery and Reinvestment Plan.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about the system to stabilize our financial system.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about reregulation and ensuring we have concrete rules of the road going forward.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll talk about a budget, and this will be on the heels of a fiscal responsibility summit -- because as we move forward, our budget deficits, most people recognize, are unsustainable.\xc2\xa0 So I think a series of those things, including home foreclosures, are what will dominate that address.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about that fiscal summit that you\'re having?\xc2\xa0 When is that, and what\'s the theme of that thing?\xc2\xa0 Is that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me pull some more information on that.\xc2\xa0 If I\'m not mistaken, that is Monday, the 23rd.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that\'s at the White House or it\'s at Blair House.\xc2\xa0 Let me pull some specific info on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The news in Pakistan, the concessions announced in the Swat Valley -- is the administration concerned that this is a beginning of a broader push into other parts of Pakistan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything particular on that except to say that we\'ve seen those reports and we\'re in contact with the Pakistani government.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you just summarize for us, to the extent that you can, what the program he\'s announcing tomorrow is supposed to accomplish?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Reducing home foreclosures.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Since I got 63 million votes less than the President of the United States, I\'ll wait 24 hours and let him do it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President had a chance to review the Leahy truth commission proposal since his press conference?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I -- I don\'t have anything to add to what he said last week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another on the joint address.\xc2\xa0 How much of it will be foreign policy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there will be -- I mean, I think you\'d have a hard time talking about our economy without talking about our commitments around the world, the health of our force structure, and obviously what is going on in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So obviously that will be a part of the address.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Afghanistan decision ready yet?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Soon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports that President Obama is going to keep all 93 U.S. attorneys; he\'s not going to fire any of them.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that at all?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that report.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember if that\'s quite right, so before I get out there I will -- I\'ll check when we land.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did the President invite any members of Congress to fly with him today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I don\'t think there are any members of Congress on this flight.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I just wondered -- usually -- I know he promised change from President Bush, but President Bush would often bring members of Congress with him aboard the plane to their own districts.\xc2\xa0 And I wondered --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see if anybody is on board from Colorado.\xc2\xa0 I know Ken Salazar -- Secretary Salazar is on board.\xc2\xa0 I think part of that was -- part of members of Congress might have been dealt with largely because a lot of them are out of Washington and out of town and have left on recess.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 12:55 P.M.
