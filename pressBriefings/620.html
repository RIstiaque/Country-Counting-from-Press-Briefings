Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>2:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 I hope you had a chance to hear the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in the Rose Garden about this historic day, the first day that Americans across the country, millions of Americans, are taking advantage of the opportunity to shop for affordable health insurance that they could not attain before now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and also to hear what he had to say about the fact that the Republicans in Congress chose to shut down the government last night.</p>\n<p>Before I take your questions, I had a couple of announcements.\xc2\xa0 First, the President, earlier today, received an update from Alyssa Mastromonaco, the Deputy Chief of Staff; Sylvia Burwell, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Jack Lew, the Secretary of the Treasury, on the shutdown and, with regards to Secretary Lew, obviously the fact, as previously announced, that in just a few weeks the Treasury runs out of the measures it can take to continue to pay our bills and thus the prospect of default becomes more real if Republicans in the Congress, pursuing the strategy they pursued when it comes to funding our government, decide to adopt that strategy to threaten default for the first time in our country\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that is not the strategy they choose.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 As the debt ceiling closes in, I wonder whether the President will encourage or allow Congress to combine both a CR and debt ceiling measures, working in parallel tracks.\xc2\xa0 And will he now negotiate some aspect of a budget deal on the CR that would give Republicans the ability to say that they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten something for this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Republicans have twisted themselves into pretzels in this effort to try to attach partisan demands to their simple responsibility to fund the government, keep it open, and their simple responsibility to make sure that the United States does not default, that the United States pays its bills.</p>\n<p>The President has been abundantly clear that he will not negotiate over Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to pay its bills.\xc2\xa0 He has been clear all year long that he is willing to negotiate with serious-minded Republicans in Congress about our budget priorities and how we should fund them, and what ways we should invest in our middle class and in our economy, and how we can continue to reduce the deficit -- continue the progress we\'ve made reducing the deficit.</p>\n<p>But he won\'t do that under threat of shutdown.\xc2\xa0 And he won\'t do that under threat of default.\xc2\xa0 This is irresponsible, reckless behavior.\xc2\xa0 As the President just said, Congress ought to open the government, return people to work, and without drama and delay fulfill its responsibility to make sure the United States pays its bills.</p>\n<p>We\'ve never defaulted in our history, and the mere threat of default, as we saw in 2011, had terrible impacts on our economy and on our middle class.\xc2\xa0 People didn\xe2\x80\x99t get jobs because of the threat of default that was put forth by Republicans in 2011.\xc2\xa0 The economy slowed down.\xc2\xa0 Markets went down.\xc2\xa0 This was the low point of our recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And that only happened with the threat of default.</p>\n<p>And unfortunately, now you see Republicans embracing a strategy where they say, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get -- we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get what we wanted through the congressional process -- so the Affordable Care Act passed the House, passed the Senate, was signed into law, was upheld by the Supreme Court, was validated in a national election -- so we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it that way, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to attach it to our responsibility to make sure the United States pays its bills.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s wildly irresponsible, and it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t a shutdown itself a pivot point where, as you say, the public might have been blaming Republicans going into it, that now the public might be looking at the President for leadership to get out of it and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here is what the President is offering Republicans.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s offering them no conditions attached to reopening the government; no conditions attached to raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 If he were to play the Republican game, he might say, you know what, I won\xe2\x80\x99t sign a bill that funds the government unless you pass legislation that 90 percent of the American people support, which is to expand background checks on gun purchases.\xc2\xa0 But he won\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xc2\xa0 He believes that kind of thing should be done through the legislative process, the normal legislative process, and we had that fight.\xc2\xa0 And he continues to press for Congress to pass an expansion of background checks, but he would not do that.\xc2\xa0 He would not attach an unrelated priority to this and threaten a shutdown or threaten default.</p>\n<p>Congress has the responsibility to keep the government open.\xc2\xa0 Congress has the responsibility to pay the United States\xe2\x80\x99 bills.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s enshrined in law.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s enshrined in the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And the President is not making any demands associated with it.\xc2\xa0 Only the Republicans are.\xc2\xa0 And what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do, as the President said today, is deprive those folks that the President had with him today, and millions more like them, of the opportunity to get affordable health insurance for the first time in their lives, or for the first time in a long time, or else they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have the government shut down and maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll default.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow the President is -- go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you read it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This just in.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Let me get this.\xc2\xa0 There is an announcement I missed which is, on Thursday, the President will visit M. Luis Construction, a local construction company, to discuss the need for Congress to act to pass a budget and pay the bills it has racked up.\xc2\xa0 M. Luis Construction is a local small business that has grown in recent years thanks to increased access to capital through President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to help small businesses.\xc2\xa0 The President will highlight the impacts that a shutdown and default would have on our economy and our nation\xe2\x80\x99s small businesses.\xc2\xa0 If Congress fails to pay its bills and default for the first time in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, it would significantly hurt the economy, meaning fewer customers for small businesses, likely higher borrowing costs for everyone, making it harder for businesses like these to get a loan.</p>\n<p>The President will urge Congress to do its job and do the things -- rather, the kinds of things that invest in our small businesses, increase jobs, and grow the economy, instead of setting it back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that visit will obviously be an opportunity for the President to speak about the issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that in D.C.?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, where is it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you still expect the shutdown continuing on Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans have the opportunity to reopen the government five minutes from now if they wanted to take that action.\xc2\xa0 We hope they do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And where is the -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the location?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the District of Columbia.\xc2\xa0 Local.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the President is meeting with members of the Financial Services Forum, which is top Wall Street CEOs.\xc2\xa0 In the context of the shutdown and the looming default, what does the President want these CEOs to do on behalf of that effort?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House, does the President believe that they still have influence with Republicans like they once may have?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re correct that he will meet with members of the Financial Services Forum here at the White House tomorrow while they are in town for their annual meeting.\xc2\xa0 And the meeting will be on a broad array of economic issues, but among them will be the disastrous impact that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise the debt ceiling, without drama or delay, would have on their businesses and on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s and world\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think these business leaders know very well what the consequences were of the mere flirtation with default that Republicans engaged in, in 2011.\xc2\xa0 That was a setback to our recovery.\xc2\xa0 It was a setback to all kinds of businesses, and it was a setback to middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Doing it over again, and going even further and actually defaulting if that\'s what the Republicans decide to do would have even more catastrophic consequences.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that would be of great concern to business leaders around the country as it is, and would to average folks around the country, who would see interest rates rise dramatically, would see credit dry up potentially for their small businesses.\xc2\xa0 And in many ways, the consequences of default are unknowable with any specificity because we\xe2\x80\x99ve never defaulted before.\xc2\xa0 What we do know is they would be catastrophic for the economy, and it would cast into question the bedrock foundation of the global economic system, which is the United States economy and the United States currency and the faith and credit of this nation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think the views of these CEOs matter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think lawmakers of both parties understand that -- at least should understand that when business leaders like these say that default would be terrible for business, would be terrible for the economy, would be terrible for the American people, they know what they\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope that members of Congress, especially Republicans, would heed that warning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Asia trip still on?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no changes to announce to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal being floated right now on the Hill to pass a series of small funding bills that would reopen certain agencies or programs.\xc2\xa0 Would the President sign that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Daily now, hourly, we\xe2\x80\x99re asked to respond to floated proposals, some of which never come to fruition because of opposition either within the Republican Party or rejection by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I can say is even that proposal shows the utter lack of seriousness that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 If they want to open the government, they should open the government, and then we can negotiate about how we fund our budget priorities in the future.\xc2\xa0 A piecemeal approach to funding the government is not a serious approach any more than it would be a serious way to try to deal with the consequences of default and the absolute necessity to maintain the full faith and credit of the United States.</p>\n<p>Again, Republican lawmakers, because they are responding to one faction of one party of one house of one branch of government and being driven by them, are twisting themselves into pretzels.\xc2\xa0 They\'re contortionists now in terms of all the ways, the different ways that they have tried to avoid their fundamental responsibility which is to keep the government functioning and to negotiate in a serious way.</p>\n<p>Remember, the President put forward a compromise budget early this year and had many discussions with Republican lawmakers about the need to find common ground, and urged them to make similar proposals that replicated his demonstrated willingness to make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 And we have not seen that all year.\xc2\xa0 But hopefully we will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have said and the President has said he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make changes to the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that could be part of a deal to break through this logjam?\xc2\xa0 Or is the White House offering that as a --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for later, is that something that you\'re offering to the Republicans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President made clear in his interview with NPR that he\'s willing to have a conversation with anyone who\'s serious about measures that might strengthen or improve the Affordable Care Act, make it better, make it more efficient in achieving its goal, which is providing insurance coverage, affordable insurance coverage to millions of Americans who don\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we\'re not going to negotiate under threat of shutdown or under shutdown in order for the Republicans to achieve their partisan agenda goals here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, we get it.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t like the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t like Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 They have tried again and again and again to repeal it, defund it, delay it, undermine it.\xc2\xa0 And they are obviously entitled to and welcome to continue to try to do that through the normal legislative means.\xc2\xa0 But what they should not do, because it\'s irresponsible, is shut down the government over that partisan pursuit, nor should they allow the United States to default in order to achieve what they could not achieve through normal means.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the consequences -- and I think really -- well, one theory that seems reasonable to me about why there is such an obsession now among Republicans with pursuing this avenue, despite the cries of protest from members of their own party in the Senate and also in the House, but outside, about what a terrible thing it is to do to the economy and to do to the party, is because they know that beginning today, the fundamental portion of the Affordable Care Act becomes real.\xc2\xa0 And instead of it just being President Obama\'s signature piece of legislation that they oppose and want to get rid of, it is the program that is providing and will provide benefits to millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>And I\'ll tell you, if you\'re a mom or a dad with a modest income and a couple of kids, and you\'re self-employed and you haven\'t been able to get affordable insurance, and you\'re worried to death about your kid\xe2\x80\x99s asthma condition or your wife\'s fear of getting breast cancer or some other -- maybe your own preexisting condition -- you may have voted Republican, you may have voted against President Obama, you may support the idea of repealing Obamacare, but when you go on the website available in your state and look at the options that you have now to provide insurance for your family for the first time, and you see that they\'re affordable, and you see that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of money there are subsidies to make it affordable, you\'re going to do the right thing by your family.\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to add that -- you\'re going to want that security for your family.</p>\n<p>And I think Republicans are worried that beginning today, it\'s not about opposing President Obama when it comes to this fight over the Affordable Care Act, it\'s about opposing the millions of Americans who are benefiting from it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House worried that this government shutdown could last a long time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are obviously concerned about the impacts of the shutdown -- the hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans who couldn\'t show up at work today and aren\'t being paid, and the hundreds of thousands more who aren\'t being paid even though they\xe2\x80\x99re working, and the effect that has on our economy and our middle class.</p>\n<p>So we hope that the House Republicans listen to the suggestions of members of their own party as well as the President and others, and simply open the government, pay the bills of the United States, do the responsible thing, and then continue to engage in serious debate and discussion about how we move forward as a nation with our economic priorities.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President out in the Rose Garden noted that some conservatives ran, or at least told their constituents that they were in Washington to repeal or shut down the government or in some way protest Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 And he noted that that, for them, was a victory.\xc2\xa0 You have indicated a sort of a ramped-up tone here about debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that doing this and succeeding has wetted their appetite instead of persuading them that this is the wrong direction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to read their minds.\xc2\xa0 What I think we\'re all concerned by, and anybody who has a concern about the American economy worries about, is that the same faction of one party in one house of one branch of government that seems to be driving the train up there in the House of Representatives, and therefore preventing Congress from doing the simple and right thing, which is opening the government and raising the debt ceiling, will employ the same tactic when it comes to raising the debt ceiling that they\xe2\x80\x99ve used so far with the simple proposition that the government should be funded and remain open.</p>\n<p>And the shutdown has its negative consequences and they\xe2\x80\x99re real and they\xe2\x80\x99re concrete for a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said today, as time passes, those consequences will grow more severe.\xc2\xa0 Default is exponentially worse.\xc2\xa0 And it is irresponsible in the extreme to even suggest that if you don\'t get what you want, you don\'t get your political scalp, that you\'re going to allow the nation to default for the first time.</p>\n<p>And, look, that\'s a genuine concern.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a concern because we\'ve been there before and we know that the only time in history that any party in Congress has ever flirted with actual default was in 2011, and we saw what happened.\xc2\xa0 The United States was downgraded for the first time.\xc2\xa0 And job creation slowed, economic growth slowed.\xc2\xa0 And what that meant, of course, was that fewer Americans got jobs and fewer businesses opened.\xc2\xa0 Real consequences.\xc2\xa0 And that was just with the flirtation with default.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to add on, other than the CEOs, are there any other powerful voices that the White House wants to enlist between now and 16 days from now to ramp up the pressure, to bring home the message that you just delivered?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any events or conversations or efforts to preview for you.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure American business leaders are very concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of Republicans in Congress, in the Senate and also in the House are concerned about it as a proposition and as a strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I think hopefully that combination of voices will succeed in prevailing upon House Republicans, and especially the leaders of the House Republican conference to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been pointed out by Republican congressmen that there is a significant majority in the House of Representatives to pass a clean CR today.\xc2\xa0 All Speaker Boehner has to do is put it on the floor.\xc2\xa0 According to some GOP members of the House, he\xe2\x80\x99d actually get a lot of Republicans to vote for it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s pretty good, right?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about 10 or 12 or 15.\xc2\xa0 According to, again, Republican predictions, it would be significantly more than that to do the right thing.</p>\n<p>So what we know is the government shut down even though a majority of the Senate and a majority of the House, including a significant bipartisan majority in the House, opposes that approach.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty easy option available to the Speaker, which is to reopen the government, and then there will be a fairly simple and responsible option available to Congress, including the Speaker, and that is to raise the debt ceiling without drama or delay -- even the flirtations with default.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long is the President willing to wait for House Republicans to pass a clean CR?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that means, because that suggests that the President could take over the House and pass one himself, and he can\'t.\xc2\xa0 He cannot order or force, call out the National Guard to get the Speaker of the House to put a clean CR on the floor.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that the Speaker and the other leaders in the House will do the right thing sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That suggests no movement on his part then towards their position.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, his position is that he is asking nothing from Republicans, no concessions to doing their job, which is funding government, and that they should go about the business of doing that.\xc2\xa0 He won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere.\xc2\xa0 And then they should go about the business responsibly -- without drama, without delay -- of raising the debt ceiling and making sure that we continue to pay our bills, as we have as a nation since the birth of the nation.</p>\n<p>And then we can proceed with the very serious, substantive negotiations about our budget priorities that the President has been trying to engage with Republicans on all year long, and around which the President has actually put on the table concrete proposals.\xc2\xa0 Republicans were very insistent upon some of the things that the President included in his budget proposals when it came to entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 That used to be what animated them.</p>\n<p>And now, apparently, what really matters most to them is not deficit reduction, or responsible -- getting control of our entitlement spending, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply doing away with a law that provides affordable health insurance to millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>Having been here at the time and having thought about it a little bit of late, I remember in the disputes between the Republican Congress and the Democratic President in the mid-1990s that led to a shutdown, you can argue whether or not that was the smart political play or substantive play by Republicans then, but at least there was a coherence to it.\xc2\xa0 It was around spending and deficits.</p>\n<p>The problem Republicans have I think now is that they\'re making this about whatever animates them politically, and most notably it\'s the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 But we saw earlier when they were attaching things, more and more conditions to what they would demand in return for doing their jobs, it was preventing women from getting contraceptive care unless their bosses said it was okay, it was other types of items that are on their partisan wish list.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- there\'s not a logical coherence to this, and it\'s not -- it\'s certainly not expressive of what had been the goals of the Republican Party in the past, when it came to at least the stated goals, even if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually practice it, which was to drive down deficits and debt.</p>\n<p>And maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s because in part, under this President, deficits have dropped 50 percent, and he\'s put on the table the only serious compromise proposal that would reduce them further and would address our medium-term debt challenges.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the Rose Garden, he used the brand "Republican shutdown" a couple of times.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to use that label when he hasn\'t even really been in contact with Republicans for over a week?\xc2\xa0 He called them last night --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He spoke to the Speaker yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was it for only -- for about a week.\xc2\xa0 I mean, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he have to take some ownership of this shutdown when you don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to the other side for a week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has had multiple intense conversations with the Republican lawmakers about our budget priorities all year long.\xc2\xa0 He has spent -- this goes to Ed\'s question yesterday -- hour upon hour with Speaker Boehner over the years, since John Boehner became Speaker, to discuss our and try to negotiate a compromise on our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 And again, he spoke with him last night.</p>\n<p>But what he can\'t do is force the House to do the simple thing, which is to keep the government open.\xc2\xa0 That is what the House has to vote on in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And he will sign it when they do.</p>\n<p>But again, his position is, I\'m making no demands, I\'m attaching no wish list items to clean legislation that would simply keep the government open.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s suggesting that the responsible thing to do on the other side is to take the same approach -- a clean CR and a bill to raise the debt ceiling without drama or delay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker said he called last night and said, I\'m not negotiating, I will not negotiate, even -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to impersonate President\'s voice.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we heard him say that in January and February.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President will not negotiate over Congress\'s responsibility to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President say to the Speaker, okay, let\'s work this out, and then I pledge to you after we get through this, you and me, we\'re going to sit down, we\'re going to talk about the budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President did say that.\xc2\xa0 He has said that.\xc2\xa0 He is willing and eager to sit --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said that last night?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He said it on NPR.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the transcript of his phone conversation with Speaker Boehner, but Speaker Boehner knows that.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner knows that the President met with Republican lawmakers repeatedly earlier this year, as did senior members of his staff, to talk about how we could move forward on our budget priorities.</p>\n<p>What he won\'t do is negotiate under the threat of shutdown or under actual shutdown.\xc2\xa0 They should just do their jobs, open the government.\xc2\xa0 The President is not asking for increased spending.\xc2\xa0 He\'s saying he\'ll go along with the continuing resolution that keeps spending levels at what they were, and then move forward to try to negotiate a bigger budget agreement that invests where we need to, protects the middle class, and reduces our deficit in a responsible, balanced way.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you have no scheduling announcements.\xc2\xa0 Just as a practical --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have -- well, I did make one for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you, and beyond that.\xc2\xa0 But as a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a practical matter, is it possible for the President to travel internationally if the government is shut down?\xc2\xa0 I mean, have you looked into that?\xc2\xa0 Do you have the personnel to do it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would -- we are currently scheduled to travel.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that in the time between now and the President\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled departure, that the Speaker does the right thing, puts on the floor of the House a bill that will overwhelmingly pass, according to Republican congressmen -- a clean CR -- and reopen the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The logistics of that I think are best addressed to the agencies involved and to OMB.\xc2\xa0 But right now, the trip is scheduled, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping -- it\xe2\x80\x99s only Tuesday -- that the government will open because the Speaker will respond to the majority of the House over which he has dominion and to the wishes of the American people, to get about the business of responsible governance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see that a shutdown would prevent the trip?\xc2\xa0 You know of nothing right now that would make that possible?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I have no new information to provide on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President bear any responsibility whatsoever for what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, for this mess?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you mean.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he bear any -- does he have any blame for the government shutdown?\xc2\xa0 Any at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President is President of the United States and it is his responsibility to try to work with Congress in a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- spirit of compromise.\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s -- look, has he or has he not put forward a compromise budget proposal?\xc2\xa0 The answer is yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he bear any responsibility?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple question.\xc2\xa0 Does he bear any responsibility for this mess?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He certainly did not vote to shut the government down.\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, no, he did not vote to shut the government down.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if he bears any responsibility.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, he did not -- Republicans in Congress chose to shut the government down.\xc2\xa0 The option to keep it open was available to them.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an option that a majority of the House of Representatives supports, a bipartisan majority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President failed to create an environment where this stuff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 By having multiple meetings and dinner --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s had multiple meetings and dinner --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s done nothing wrong in all of this?\xc2\xa0 This is all the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 doing on their own that the President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, you can do an essay or decide for yourself and make those judgments.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you is that this year, the President, in a very public way, reported on by all of you, reached out to Republicans and offered to find common ground on budget issues -- and didn\xe2\x80\x99t just talk about it; put --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- hold on -- put those ideas in a concrete budget, causing a lot of consternation in his own party, because some of the choices he made and some of the decisions he was willing to embrace were not popular among all Democrats, or Democrat support groups.\xc2\xa0 But he was willing to do it because he knew that that\xe2\x80\x99s what it would take to reach a compromise with Republicans who are also willing to compromise.\xc2\xa0 And he had very good conversations with a number of Republican senators and members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 He had Paul Ryan in here at one point during that process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen, unfortunately, is a commensurate willingness by the Republicans to put on paper a proposal that represents a compromise, that moves off their insistence that -- represented by the Ryan budget.\xc2\xa0 But the President is open to doing that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s open to having those conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But when it comes down to here\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not asking for anything in return; the government should remain open.\xc2\xa0 Congress has the power to fund the government.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s asking for nothing in return for Congress fulfilling its responsibility to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s asking that they do not do anything else.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Jay, what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, nobody doubts that the Republicans have a lot of responsibility in what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, looking back -- I mean, the President is not happy with where he is right now.\xc2\xa0 So looking back over this whole process, is there anything he looks back and says, \xe2\x80\x9cGosh, if I had done this, or tried to do this, or tried to build this relationship or that relationship\xe2\x80\x9d --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there nothing that he did or didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that he --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, the President has tried in serious ways to find compromise with Republicans, and he looks forward to doing it again once the Republicans in the House do the responsible thing and open the government and stop threatening to default on our obligations for the first time in history.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you give us an evaluation of the first day of the health care exchanges?\xc2\xa0 The consumer experience on the websites -- some have had glitches, some have been slow, as the President mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Is that entirely a product of over-expected use, or are there some internal mechanistic things you have to fix because they\xe2\x80\x99re not quite ready?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on web design, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t glitches that are just technical in nature.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are, as we said there would be, as with any large-scale rollout of a policy like this.\xc2\xa0 It was true of Social Security, Medicare, Medicare Part D under the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what is unquestionably the case is that there has been an enormous amount of interest, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen by the number of people who have visited the website.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like people trying to get tickets to the first Pirates home playoff game, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you know when you go on the site and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to load the page that it\xe2\x80\x99s because a lot of people like you want to find out if tickets are available, and the great news about this is it\xe2\x80\x99s not one game, it\xe2\x80\x99s not one night; the seats are unlimited and the availability will be there for every American family that wants affordable health insurance.</p>\n<p>So we take this, as Bill Clinton used to say, as a high-class problem.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the absolute interest out there around the country in exploring these options, because a lot of families out there -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the 15 percent out there who are uninsured and those who don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance through their employer -- who want the opportunity to purchase affordable health insurance and have that security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And you heard from the President about this today:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a life-changing event.\xc2\xa0 An amazing statistic, which he cited, that if you have health insurance and you\'re diagnosed with cancer, you are 70 percent more likely to live five years than if you don\'t have health insurance.\xc2\xa0 That is a direct correlation between being insured and living.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a big deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you have some general projections about how many people are likely to sign up, and talked to some of your health care experts on that.\xc2\xa0 But I want to ask you on the record here, for the next six months, as this enrollment period is open, what is the main metric for the White House measuring its success?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some people in the White House talk about it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a number, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a ratio -- meaning the higher and a greater ratio you have of younger, healthier Americans without insurance getting in the system, the more successful you will view that.\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate representation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That you need to get younger, healthiers into the system.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question that it is important to the successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act and to having it work in a way that allows for those with preexisting conditions never to be denied coverage, that younger, healthier Americans have insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the Affordable Care Act is written in a way that allows for subsidies for younger people who may have low incomes but may not qualify for Medicaid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the purpose is to give them the option of affordable health insurance, an option that may not have been available to them in the past.\xc2\xa0 And by doing that, you expand the pool significantly, you add millions of people to the ranks of the insured, and you make the whole system more affordable.</p>\n<p>The President talked about all of the dire predictions that we heard from Republicans back when we were debating.\xc2\xa0 I saw one senator say we never debated Obamacare, which is a rather remarkable statement given the months and months of debate over Obamacare when it was moving through Congress.\xc2\xa0 But there were a lot of dire predictions, including exploding health care costs, that have not turned out to be true; in fact, when it comes to the growth in health care costs, the opposite is true.\xc2\xa0 The last three years have been -- have represented the slowest pace of growth in our health care costs in half a century.</p>\n<p>So since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the opposite of what the critics predicted has happened.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, millions of Americans are -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know, necessarily, it\'s from Obamacare, but they\'re enjoying the fact that their kids can stay on their insurance policies until they\'re 26.\xc2\xa0 They\'re enjoying the subsidies for prescription drug costs that the Affordable Care Act provides.\xc2\xa0 They\'re enjoying the rebates that the Affordable Care Act demands insurance companies pay their customers when they spend too much on overhead and CEO pay, and not enough directly on health care.</p>\n<p>And then, beginning today, the other big component of the Affordable Care Act becomes reality.\xc2\xa0 And day after day, from now until January 1st when insurance kicks in and from that day ever after, millions of Americans who did not have insurance and did not have access to affordable insurance will have it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as they look at their choices, young Americans who don\xe2\x80\x99t have coverage will see a variety of plans, but many of them will come with high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses that will be one of the reasons that their premiums are generally affordable, because that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the tradeoffs in insurance for everyone -- it will be a tradeoff for young Americans who don\xe2\x80\x99t have coverage.\xc2\xa0 Since it\'s important for this to succeed, to have that ratio of younger Americans sign up, how nervous are you about the central tension that they will see on these websites that if you\'re going to get coverage, you\'re going to have a lot of out-of-pocket expenses, and many of them may say, you know what, even with the subsidies, it\'s still not worth it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are great questions, and I think the answer to that question is one of the reasons why we\'ve been encouraged by the premium rates that have been established going into this enrollment day, and by the fact that the options available to everyone in every state is looking at plan availability are many and varied, and that everybody can make the choice for himself or herself about what kind of coverage they can afford, and what fits best for their security and for their family, or for themselves, if they\'re an individual.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And remember, the alternative here is not some -- we had this discussion, Ed and I did, before -- not some mythical insurance that\xe2\x80\x99s available now for less, because that insurance --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying they may have made -- might make a decision not to do it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Even if it were available, though, if you\'re a kid, a young person -- 27 now, because you can\'t -- you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to be on your parents\' insurance anymore -- making a very modest income, but maybe you have available to you insurance on an individual market.\xc2\xa0 But the fine print tells you that you can have yearly caps, you have lifetime caps, you have huge deductibles, you can be banned from coverage if you have a preexisting condition -- all of these things that will no longer be true because of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>So I think that the -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re counting on is that Americans out there will review this, look at their options and decide that this is a good deal.\xc2\xa0 And it makes sense that having health insurance adds to their security and to their quality of life, and that the option of rushing to the emergency room when something happens is hardly superior to the option of having insurance, quality affordable insurance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how do you pry those who are up to 26, say 20 to 26, who are on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plan out of there and get them into the exchanges?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that -- this is an effort.\xc2\xa0 And this is a good point, that today makes not the end but the beginning of an effort to provide Americans with a huge amount of information about the options available to them and the benefits that the Affordable Care Act provides.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re very confident about how it\xe2\x80\x99s going thus far and what\xe2\x80\x99s available to the American people that has never been available before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, the foreign minister -- you may have seen --went on Twitter last night and had started attacking the President and suggesting -- it seemed like he was not happy with the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments in the meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He accused the U.S. of \xe2\x80\x9cillegal threats and sanctions that are disrespectful of a nation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmacho and wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He accused the President of flip-flopping.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t read every last detail.\xc2\xa0 But how do you react to that, number one?\xc2\xa0 And what does that mean about the state of these talks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along that the important measuring stick when it comes to pursuing this diplomatic opening with Iran is action -- what actions are being taken by Iran to demonstrate that they are interested in fulfilling their obligations to the international community.\xc2\xa0 And the President was clear in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly:\xc2\xa0 There will surely be important obstacles to moving forward and success is by no means guaranteed.\xc2\xa0 But he believes we can reach a comprehensive solution.</p>\n<p>And there is no question that we have heard and seen from the new government in Iran a different approach and a new approach.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying all along, it is absolutely worth exploring -- because the window of opportunity remains open -- a diplomatic resolution to this problem, to the problem that the whole international community is organized around, which is the need to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we are united with our allies and partners on this issue, and we are united in the idea that we should pursue this opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome all the indications that we\'ve seen from the new Iranian government that they\xe2\x80\x99re serious about pursuing it.\xc2\xa0 But this will be something we can measure through the P5-plus-1 process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Positive indications, but then when there are rants like this, does that not make the point that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been making at the U.N. today and yesterday here at the White House and elsewhere that -- I think one of the things he said today is that Iran is really a wolf in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s clothing and that they\xe2\x80\x99re saying some positive things and the next day they say something really negative.\xc2\xa0 I hear you reacting to the positive things they\xe2\x80\x99ve said, but then they were slamming the President last night --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think we have been consistent, the President has been consistent.\xc2\xa0 He took office in January 2009, making clear his willingness to have bilateral discussions with Tehran, if Tehran was willing to address seriously the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because of the position he took, it became clear at the time that the United States was not the issue here, it was the behavior of Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that clarity allowed for the building of the most comprehensive set of sanctions that the world has ever seen, and the implementation of those sanctions, which, in turn, has led in part to where we find ourselves today, which is with a new government in Iran that has indicated willingness to negotiate a solution to this problem, diplomatically.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, as the President made clear, words here are meaningful, but actions are most meaningful.\xc2\xa0 And it is only through verifiable, transparent resolution of this challenge where the international community can be confident that Iran has given up its nuclear weapons ambitions that we can get a resolution.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be very firm on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick points on the budget.\xc2\xa0 You talked earlier about Boehner and saying that the President can\'t send the National Guard to get him to pass this bill.\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Ronald Reagan find a way to work with Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill?\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Bill Clinton?\xc2\xa0 Newt Gingrich was extremely difficult.\xc2\xa0 Personally, they sometimes had a tense relationship, Gingrich would go on his ideological efforts as well, and yet they somehow came together in the end.\xc2\xa0 So is it really fair to just say, we can\'t send the National Guard after this guy?\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t the President sit down with him the way Reagan did with O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, the way Clinton did with Gingrich?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, the President has sat down with and met with and talked to John Boehner extensively over the time that Speaker Boehner has held that office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Recently?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He talked to him yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked to him many times this year.\xc2\xa0 I think you know as well as I that the Speaker indicated earlier this year that he would never negotiate with the President again.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a position the President held; that was a position articulated by the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 It seemed like a little irrational to us, but that\'s what he told reporters.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, Tip O\'Neill never threatened to default.\xc2\xa0 Tip O\'Neill never allowed the most radical elements of his caucus dictate what Democrats in the House would do.\xc2\xa0 And we need a willingness by the leadership in the House to listen to the majority of lawmakers in the House, including a significant and sizeable portion of Republicans in the House as well as in the Senate, as well as Republicans outside of Congress, and simply open the government no strings attached, no partisan strings attached.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Going back to Jon\'s question, we\'re not attaching any partisan baubles to this tree here.\xc2\xa0 Just do your job, and then we can have the serious negotiations that the President has been engaged in and willing to engage in all year long.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 I think Jim asked you yesterday about calling the Republicans "terrorists" -- not you personally -- "arsonists."\xc2\xa0 You used the word "extortion" yesterday, which is obviously a pretty serious charge.\xc2\xa0 My question is -- a few moments ago, you were saying that it\'s time for the Republicans to get serious about the budget; you used the worst "serious" a few times.\xc2\xa0 How does it help you get serious, how does it help you get a deal if you\'re calling Republicans "extortionists" and "terrorists?"\xc2\xa0 How does it help?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think they are attempting to extort the American people in many ways, and the economy, in order to get their partisan objectives.\xc2\xa0 And I can only echo a Republican House member who accused his colleagues of being "suicidal lemmings."\xc2\xa0 I mean, that was what he said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the name-calling from here -- (laughter) -- the changing the tone -- let them call whatever they want to call themselves.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we can all establish that some of the harshest criticism of Republicans happening in Washington right now is coming from Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let them shoot each other.\xc2\xa0 My question is, what about changing the tone from here?\xc2\xa0 No, really.\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t you rise above that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because this is a -- look, we are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s serious, yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are not -- again, we\'re not asking anything from Republicans in Congress in return for them fulfilling their fundamental responsibilities, raising the debt ceiling without drama or delay, not threatening default, opening the government, and continuing to fund it at, again, levels that hardly represent the demands or wishes of the President or the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s a simple proposition.\xc2\xa0 And if you\'re suggesting, by your question, that they\'ve shut down the government because their feelings are hurt -- I think a lot of Americans would be shocked and dismayed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I unfortunately have the live shots, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make it fast.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, please.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Robert Gibbs said today on MSNBC, "I think if you\'re the White House you just sit back and watch."\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate way to describe the thinking moving forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that Robert was on MSNBC as a commentator expressing his advice, or what he would do.\xc2\xa0 But I think it does reflect the fact that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have control here over what the House leadership does, even though we wish we did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\'s up to the House leadership to do the right thing, pass a clean CR, open the government, do the right thing, pass without drama or delay a bill that would raise the debt ceiling and ensure that we do not even think about default.</p>\n<p>So I think that just represents a reality here, which is that it would be irresponsible to negotiate under partisan threat the full faith and credit of the United States.\xc2\xa0 That would set a precedent for Presidents of any party in the future, dealing with Congresses of any party in the future that would be enormously damaging to the economic strength of the United States and the economic security of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So that is a long-term bad idea, so the President won\xe2\x80\x99t engage in it, and he\xe2\x80\x99s right to take that position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we can expect him to go out and hold these events like he did today at the Rose Garden, but not necessarily --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President said the other day he would be talking with leaders of Congress with some regularity.\xc2\xa0 He spoke with them yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll update you when he has conversations or meetings again.</p>\n<p>But again, he can\'t -- as much as he probably wishes he could, he can\'t simply appoint himself Speaker for the day and bring a bill to the floor.\xc2\xa0 He wishes that this could happen so the Republicans and Democrats in a substantial and sizeable vote in the House could vote to reopen the government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just quickly, of the million people who you cited who logged on to healthcare.gov today, do you have a sense of how many of those actually were able to go through with it given the glitches that were reported?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to HHS for details.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is day one.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the run-up to day one, we expect in the early period of enrollment that, as with anything like this, there would be a lot of window-shopping, a lot of plan comparisons, and that as people gathered more information about their options, more and more people would choose to enroll.\xc2\xa0 And we see that unfolding as the days and weeks continue over the six-month enrollment period.</p>\n<p>Remember, whether you enroll today or in December, your insurance takes effect on January 1st, and then after, the middle of December I think, it begins commensurate with when you enroll.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we will I\xe2\x80\x99m sure have some data on that periodically available.\xc2\xa0 But on day one, all we know is that there have been many, many visitors to the site, and we think that is evidence of a great deal of interest in the possibility of purchasing affordable health insurance for Americans around the country.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nakamura.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, part of the reason the President was going to go to Asia or is going to go to Asia is part of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s pivot to Asia and the shift to Asia to try to show that region of the world, and countries especially in southeast Asia, that emerging democracies and American values is the right way to go, especially compared to other systems, maybe like China and others.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious whether the President, as he prepares to go on this trip, is concerned that what\'s happening in Washington this week undermines that argument.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President has made clear through his travels and his policies that he believes it\'s essential for us to rebalance our approach to foreign affairs, and that that pivot towards Asia has been in the process of being carried out since he took office, and continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, this is an enormous opportunity for the United States economically and for the American people, and he will continue to pursue it.\xc2\xa0 He does believe that it is part of his job as Commander-in-Chief and President to travel to Asia and elsewhere to help create more economic opportunity for the American people, and also to create more national security opportunity for the United States.\xc2\xa0 And so he -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why he makes trips like these, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s also trying to show off the American values and American system to folks over there or countries over there.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask it another way.\xc2\xa0 If he goes on this trip at a time the government is shut down, would he have a sense of embarrassment about Washington and what\'s happening right now -- on the world stage?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'re certainly hoping that Republican leaders make the right decision in the coming days to reopen the government, extend funding at current levels so that we can get about the business of having serious negotiations about longer-term budget deals.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s my way of saying I\'m not going to accept the predicate there.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that, certainly, dysfunction in Washington is an unfortunate thing.\xc2\xa0 But we also live in a democracy, and democracies can be messy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s been messy for a while, and this seems like a larger step in the mess.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it depends on what you\'re talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First time in 17 years the government has been shut down.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When it comes to shutdown, the impacts are serious and they\'re consequential, and they\'re not good.\xc2\xa0 Default is a whole other proposition.\xc2\xa0 And what is disturbing about what we are seeing unfold on Capitol Hill with those Republicans who are most fervent and seem to be leading all the other Republicans in the House, is their willingness to engage with the proposition of default in order to achieve their partisan aims.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A lot of them ran, promising to repeal Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 And keeping with their promises, they have voted many times to repeal or defund or undermine Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 And you may argue whether that was a sensible use of their time -- because it wasn\'t successful -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly fine in terms of what their responsibilities are fulfilling the promises they made on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 But I doubt that any of them seriously said, I am going to repeal Obamacare or else I\'ll send the world economy into global recession and middle-class families around the country will suffer because of it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I heard that on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>Carol, and then Mara, and then Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any direct reaction to Prime Minister Netanyahu\'s speech at the U.N. today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a direct reaction.\xc2\xa0 I actually saw it on my screen but I was in a meeting, and so I haven\'t heard that much about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 You have to ask me a more specific question.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch all of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it was pretty aggressive towards Iran.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve said all along, as the President has said, we understand, and it is entirely justifiable, that Israel is skeptical about Iran and Iran\'s intentions.\xc2\xa0 After all, this is a country whose leadership, until recently, was pledging to annihilate Israel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So their security concerns are understandable.\xc2\xa0 Their skepticism is understandable.\xc2\xa0 And we share with Israel and with Prime Minister Netanyahu the same goal and the same firm policy, which is, Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday\'s meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama represented just the latest in a series of meetings and conversations that the President has had -- the two leaders have had in which this issue has been a topic of conversation, in which information has been shared and perspectives have been shared.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the two leaders and the two countries agree on this challenge and agree on the policy objective has been shared.</p>\n<p>So again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I wasn\'t able to listen to the Prime Minister\'s speech with any detail.\xc2\xa0 But as the President has said, it\'s understandable why Israel has concerns about Iran\'s nuclear weapons program.\xc2\xa0 We share those concerns.\xc2\xa0 And in Israel, obviously, the concerns are more intense because of the neighborhood they live in and because of the threats that previous leaders of Iran have made towards Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you share the skepticism?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying we share Israel\'s skepticism, or just the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said all along that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Netanyahu said that this is a ruse, that the opening is a ruse.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Iranian leadership has, very publicly -- and everyone here has reported on it -- changed their approach to resolving this issue with the international community.\xc2\xa0 We will not know if they\'re serious about it until we test the proposition, until we see, through the P5-plus-1 negotiations, how willing they are to reach an agreement with the international community in which they meet all their obligations, and demonstrate in a convincing, verifiable, transparent way that they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>So this is about actions.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not about words.\xc2\xa0 What we have said -- again, what we have said -- you guys keep asking me to respond to a speech that I haven\'t -- I wasn\'t able to hear, but I understand the basic sentiment.\xc2\xa0 And what we have said is that there is a window of opportunity to resolve this diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 Resolving it diplomatically is preferable, as a general matter, but obviously because it\'s the best way to assure that Iran cannot pursue a nuclear weapon and does not have a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as long as that window is open -- and now we have a government in Iran, apparently with the sanction of the Supreme Leader that is engaging with the international community in a more serious way than we\'ve seen in recent years -- we ought to pursue that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just -- as one more follow on that -- is Israel\'s aggressiveness on this and Netanyahu\'s rhetoric, does that undermine what you guys are trying to do diplomatically, given the closeness of Israel and the U.S?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we have an extremely close relationship with Israel.\xc2\xa0 We have an absolute commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and we share Israel\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to making sure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>We believe -- and the President and the Prime Minister discussed this yesterday -- that we ought to pursue this diplomatic opening because the window of opportunity remains open.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along that it won\xe2\x80\x99t remain open forever, but this opportunity is here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s here in part because of the policy positions the President took that allowed for the implementation of the most comprehensive set of sanctions in history, which, in turn, has had an obvious and serious effect on the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 And it is understandable why Iran would want relief from those sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And we will have discussions with -- through the P5-plus-1 -- Iran and see whether or not Iran is serious about, in a verifiable way, giving up their nuclear weapons ambitions and demonstrating --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a yes or a no?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was better than both.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, Mara.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought I was next.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said Mara then Mark.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a similarity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara, Mark, Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question, just to go back to the clean appropriations bills that they\'re talking about doing, D.C., veterans and parks, is that a good sign?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the fever is breaking?\xc2\xa0 How do you evaluate that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the increasing number of voices on the Republican side calling for the leadership in the House to do the sensible thing and pass a clean CR is a good sign, if it has an effect.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out whether or not the leadership is serious about opening the government when they do it.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t think the partial --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it doesn\'t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a particularly serious way to address this.\xc2\xa0 If they want to open the government, they ought to open the government.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a simple way to do it.</p>\n<p>Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not asking -- nobody is asking -- Democrats aren\xe2\x80\x99t asking, the White House isn\xe2\x80\x99t asking for any partisan objectives to be attached to a bill that would extend funding for the government, and neither should the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And we should just reopen it, make sure that those hundreds of thousands of Americans can go back to work and be paid so that they can meet their obligations, and then, even more significantly, that Congress ought to very deliberately, without drama, without delay, pass an increase in the debt ceiling so that we can remove from the table any thought or fear that the United States might default.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Durbin said that he thought that negotiations separate from a shutdown and a default, but negotiations on the budget that had the repeal of the medical device tax might be a way to solve this, provide some kind of fig leaf for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Are you pursuing that in any way?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about negotiating on the shutdown.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about a separate track.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating with anybody to reopen the government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating with anybody for the Congress to pass the bill that would reopen the government on any partisan condition.</p>\n<p>What the President has said, as he said yesterday to Steve Inskeep, is that he\xe2\x80\x99s always been willing to have conversations with lawmakers of both parties who have ideas about how to make the Affordable Care Act better, more efficient and more effective for millions of American families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, one of the ironies of this -- again, of the spaghetti that\'s been thrown on the wall here by Republicans -- one of the ironies of this proposal is that it would increase the deficit significantly if it were passed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You would have to offset it somewhere else, but --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, have you heard Republicans --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are those negotiations underway?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They are not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Congress has a responsibility to fund the government, so they should open the government.\xc2\xa0 Congress has a responsibility to pay the bills of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Raising the debt ceiling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add a dime to the deficit, has nothing to do with even a nickel of new spending.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about paying that bill you get every month after you\xe2\x80\x99ve bought things with your credit card.\xc2\xa0 Congress made these purchases.\xc2\xa0 The bill is now due, or will be, and they ought to pay the bills -- because the United States has always paid its bills.</p>\n<p>Separate from that, we\'ve always been willing to have serious conversations about finding compromise on our budget challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is it fair when you say that raising the debt limit is just about paying bills?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about authorizing more government borrowing, which leads to more government spending and an expansion of the national debt.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The debt limit talks about authorizing more borrowing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To pay bills that have already been charged.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve already -- you, Mark, bought a car last month, put it on your credit card.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been driving that car.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been receiving the benefits of that car.\xc2\xa0 And now, since you put it on a credit card, the credit card says you got to pay the bill.\xc2\xa0 So this is not about buying a new car.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not even about putting gas in the car, or adding a spoiler.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about -- (laughter)\xc2\xa0 -- which maybe you would.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s about going to you and saying, my good friend, Jay, will you lend me money to pay for my car.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s about telling --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about borrowing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it is about borrowing money to pay the bills that Congress has already charged.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Treasury can\'t pay any bills unless it borrows more money.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct, and we go into default.\xc2\xa0 But these are old bills.\xc2\xa0 This is not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They only go into default if you don\'t borrow the money to pay the bills.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, if we don\'t pay the bills we go into default.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but if you get -- if the debt limit increase is authorized, then you can borrow more to pay the bills.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the problem.\xc2\xa0 You do not, by refusing to raise the debt ceiling -- I mean, in addition to causing global economic calamity, you don\'t reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t eliminate new spending.\xc2\xa0 You do that by having serious, compromise-oriented negotiations in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President has done throughout his presidency, resulting, by the way, in a halving of the deficit on his watch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Remember, he took office -- economic crisis, financial crisis, massive recession, huge job loss, talks about the banks being nationalized, talk about 25 percent unemployment, and the new President inherited the largest deficits in history in this country.\xc2\xa0 Spin forward nearly five years, and the deficit has now been halved on his watch, we are reducing our deficits at the fastest pace since demobilization in the wake of World War II.\xc2\xa0 And the President is eager in a responsible and balanced way to do more, as we ensure that we continue to invest where necessary so that the middle class gets a fair deal.</p>\n<p>But imagine if the shoe were on the other foot.\xc2\xa0 Imagine if this President or any Democratic President was saying, I will shut down the government, or I will default on our obligations if you don\xe2\x80\x99t raise corporate taxes -- and then flip it around --\xc2\xa0 what\xe2\x80\x99s next from the Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Well, if they get what they want in order to reopen the government or not default for a few months or a few weeks, next they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, okay, undo the increase in tax rates for the wealthiest of Americans, for millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t give a tax break to millionaires and billionaires, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go into default.\xc2\xa0 That could be next.\xc2\xa0 Or it could be contraception, or it could be something else.</p>\n<p>No President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying on that point, but when you say that raising the debt limit is just about paying bills, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the government borrowing more money and increasing the national debt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about paying bills that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That have already been incurred.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, Mark, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re disagreeing at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re borrowing more money to do so, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have to borrow money to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you always skip that point.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 When Congress votes, as it has more than 40 times since Ronald Reagan took office, without drama or delay, until 2011 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To authorize borrowing more money.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY: -- they authorized the Treasury --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To borrow --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to borrow money to pay bills.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because we, the United States, have never defaulted.\xc2\xa0 We pay our bills.\xc2\xa0 And the option on the table is that if the Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t get to undermine Obamacare -- in other words, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get to take insurance away from the families that were out there in the Rose Garden today, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to default for the first time in history. I mean, some Republicans have called that crazy, Ed.\xc2\xa0 Just crazy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But one last thing.\xc2\xa0 But to avoid default, you need to borrow more money.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this raising the debt limit is all about.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 To pay the bills that the United States has incurred, that Congress has incurred, we have to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To borrow more money.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, we agree.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick things I want to clarify.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re telling us that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell us in these coming days when the President speaks to the Speaker and the leaders.\xc2\xa0 So he has not spoken to them --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sometimes the Speaker and the leaders beat us to the punch, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 Not always, though.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that over the years, there have been numerous conversations and meetings between the President and the Speaker that haven\xe2\x80\x99t always been announced by the leaders in Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has not spoken to any of the four of them since midnight, since the shutdown?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out here for a little while, but I have no conversations to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And second, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little confused about one thing:\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid said yesterday that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want -- the Senate was rejecting conferees because they want to have a clean CR for whatever period of time that was, one or two weeks first, before they would sit down and negotiate on the big issue.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to -- that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate; he wants the clean CR just to keep the government -- or reopen the government.\xc2\xa0 So is he not negotiating now, he\xe2\x80\x99s not calling them over because he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for a clean CR first before he goes into those other issues?\xc2\xa0 Because you say he won\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate on those broader issues.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I get where you\xe2\x80\x99re heading.\xc2\xa0 The President will not negotiate with Republicans over the responsibility to keep the government open at current funding levels under threat of shutdown or under threat of continuing the shutdown.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s reckless and irresponsible behavior by Republicans and I think many Republicans have called it worse.\xc2\xa0 So, one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Two, I think that this particular proposal that you mention demonstrates the utter lack of seriousness -- tweeting out photos that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.\xc2\xa0 I mean, all year long -- when it comes to the conferencing, right?\xc2\xa0 All year long -- I mean, prior to the budget deal at the end of the year, on January 1st, the Republican mantra was the Senate won\xe2\x80\x99t pass a budget, the Democrats in the Senate won\xe2\x80\x99t pass a budget; we need to return to regular order; we, House Republicans, have responsibly passed a budget every year and the Senate Democrats haven\xe2\x80\x99t; we demand, as part of this deal, that the Senate pass a budget and that we return to regular order, and that means House budget, Senate budget, conferees are appointed by the leaders of each, and they work out a compromise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President said, okay.\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid and Senator Murray said, okay.\xc2\xa0 They passed a budget, acceding to the demands of the Republicans in the House.\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan demanded it. John Boehner demanded it.\xc2\xa0 Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy, they all said they have to do this.\xc2\xa0 So they did it, and what have the Republicans refused to do ever since?\xc2\xa0 Appoint conferees.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to sit at the table to negotiate and reach a compromise over the differences between the Senate budget and the House budget.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to engage in regular order.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to do what they said must be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think, again, that represents a lack of seriousness in their approach, you might say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I ask one more?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A Hill report -- Steve.\xc2\xa0 Go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the debt ceiling, we\xe2\x80\x99re a couple of weeks away.\xc2\xa0 The President in the past and Jack Lew in the past have talked about the possibility of Social Security payments being delayed.\xc2\xa0 Should folks out there who rely on those Social Security payments be worried that given the inability of Congress to just keep the government open, that they\xe2\x80\x99re also not going to be able to hit that debt ceiling, and that those checks might not be in the mail at the end of the month?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any specific predictions about the consequences of default -- others are better able to do that -- except to say that the consequences of default would, I think, as universally recognized by credible economists and men and women in the business community, be devastating.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say this will happen or that will happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans have talked about passing legislation to make sure that Social Security is walled off in the same way that troop pay was.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President would sign.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, relying on my memory from past experience, is that what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is the full faith and credit of the United States.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cFaith\xe2\x80\x9d is an important word there.\xc2\xa0 Faith is the assurance that investors around the world have that the United States will always pay its bills.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why our economy is so strong.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why it is relied upon.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why our currency is so important to the functioning of the global economic and financial system.</p>\n<p>And so I think the idea that you pay some of your bills but not others would not reward that faith particularly well.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is there should be no diversion from what has been true throughout our history, which is that the United States, in many ways unique among nations, is always good to its word, that it pays its bills.\xc2\xa0 It is the safest investment in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that is an important place to occupy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether the White House, given we are a couple weeks away and given there is no clear path to passing a debt limit increase --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the clearest of paths.\xc2\xa0 The simplest of paths.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I understand -- doing what you want.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not what I want.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President said.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about what he wants.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But given that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you said it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that we could be going over this cliff, has there been any -- with Mr. Lew this morning, with other people -- any team in the administration sort of planning what would happen on October 18th?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Treasury Department on that one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:16 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
