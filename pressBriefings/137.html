In addition to working to cut carbon pollution, build a clean energy economy and protect our natural resources, the Administration has taken unprecedented steps to better prepare communities across the country for the increasingly destructive impacts of climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, the Administration is announcing historic commitments to building climate resilient communities, including announcing the winners of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\xe2\x80\x99s (HUD) National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC). 13 states and local communities across the country will receive a combined $1 billion in disaster recover funds to rebuild and better prepare for future extreme weather and other climate change impacts. To build on our continued commitment to investing in the resilience of the most vulnerable communities, the Administration is also today announcing the expansion of the Resilience AmeriCorps and Climate Action Champions programs. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will commit an additional $4 million over three years to expand the Resilience AmeriCorps program to the 27 finalists that did not receive funding through the NDRC competition.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>HUD Announces Winners of the National Disaster Resilience Competition</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced nearly $1 billion in HUD Disaster Recovery funds to the winners of the National Disaster Resilience Competition.\xc2\xa0 The communities selected will use the funding to recover from prior disasters in 2011, 2012 and 2013 by deploying solutions that will improve their ability to withstand and recover more quickly from future disasters, hazards, and shocks.
