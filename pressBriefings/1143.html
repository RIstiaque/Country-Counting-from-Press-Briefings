CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, before I take your questions, just wanted to let you know that on Friday President Obama will visit CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to meet with a broad range of the intelligence community, to thank them for the work they do every day to keep America safe and specifically for their excellent work in tracking down Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 That will be I think expanded pool coverage, is my understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that his first visit to the CIA?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check.\xc2\xa0 Might be.\xc2\xa0 Is it?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 You tell me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been before?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been before.\xc2\xa0 The President has been before.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it something he wanted to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Very much so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I actually was -- happened to be in his presence when he said he wanted to do this, which was a while back in the wake of the successful bin Laden mission.\xc2\xa0 So this was a presidential decision that he wanted to make this trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, with questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what can you tell us about the reports on the aid package for Middle East tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any specifics.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go beyond where I was yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think that we will have a call later this afternoon backgrounding on the speech a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply say that the President views the situation in the Middle East as a moment of opportunity, the Middle East and North Africa, as a real moment of opportunity for America and for Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the last decade, our focus in the region was largely on Iraq, which was a military effort, and on the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the fight against al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 That fight against al Qaeda continues, but there is an opportunity in that region to focus on advancing our values and enhancing our security, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President looks forward to discussing tomorrow in his speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a message the President will also take with him to Europe and specifically to the G8 to discuss with other world leaders the moment of opportunity --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, indeed, he will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as well for the region?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about what he may or may not be proposing.\xc2\xa0 I did mention yesterday that he will have some specific policy ideas related to this moment of opportunity, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t characterize them further from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Things like export credits and reprogramming of aid --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the September deadline that he had set for a peace agreement last year?\xc2\xa0 Would he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that this is also, as he said yesterday during his meeting with King Abdullah, that this is a moment of opportunity for the peace process to move forward.\xc2\xa0 He strongly urges both sides to negotiate and to move forward on the peace process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think Dominique Strauss-Kahn should step down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with what I was saying yesterday, which we -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on a legal matter.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond what the Secretary of Treasury said, and I -- we are very confident the IMF can continue to function effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he working on the speech today, or how close is he to being done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been working on it for several days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he writing most of it, or is this the kind of speech where he would write --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When you have somebody who knows his way around a sentence and paragraph as well as the President does, all speeches are at least in part written by him.\xc2\xa0 And this is one that he\xe2\x80\x99s very engaged in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Change topic to the deficit talks with departure from the Gang of Six of Senator Coburn, yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that dims the prospect for bipartisan progress towards a deficit-reduction deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that there are a number of members of Congress, both houses, who are committed to trying to find a solution to this thorny problem.\xc2\xa0 This is also a moment of opportunity the President believes that the broad consensus that exists creates an opportunity to do something serious about deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 He is committed to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He thinks that is very important because getting our fiscal house in order is important in and of -- as a goal in and of itself.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also vital so that we can continue -- we are able to continue to invest in those areas that will enhance our growth and give us the best chance to create the kinds of jobs that are well paying and will stay in this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when a member drops out, how is that a moment of opportunity?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking more broadly that this is a moment of opportunity.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward his plan and his vision.\xc2\xa0 There have been other plans and visions out there.\xc2\xa0 There --obviously great work done by the Simpson-Bowles commission, the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal commission.\xc2\xa0 And so I think that we remain confident that the negotiations being led by the Vice President have made progress and will continue to make progress.\xc2\xa0 And the President is optimistic that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to accomplish some significant deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question.\xc2\xa0 IMF personnel -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve reported that White House staff David Lipton has been considered as number two to replace John Lipsky.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no comment on IMF personnel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he doing in Connecticut after the speech?\xc2\xa0 It seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s quite a few hours that we\xe2\x80\x99re there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be -- it has to do with our mode of transportation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any flavor of what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get to in the speech at the academy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to the unique role of the Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0 The United States Coast Guard Academy I think was founded in 1876.\xc2\xa0 I believe there are 228 graduates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- security in any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Broadly, he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the Coast Guard\xe2\x80\x99s role in protecting the United States, protecting Americans.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a focused speech on -- a true commencement address.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the budget just a moment.\xc2\xa0 I think you were asked this yesterday about any more Biden talks with lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 Anything new overnight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on the -- in terms of the Vice President or the schedule for the next meetings, although we do expect those to take place when both houses are back.\xc2\xa0 And there have been regular consultations at the staff level this week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Anything else?\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 9:46 A.M.
