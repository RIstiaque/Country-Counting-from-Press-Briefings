EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Since the crisis began, a couple of the central questions have been whether President Mubarak should stay in power, and if so, whether he has the capacity to put in place these reforms the people of Egypt want and the White House wants.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why on those two fronts the White House is not taking a position?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, it is not up to us to determine when the grievances of the Egyptian people have been met by the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that there are, as I mentioned, legitimate concerns and grievances had by the Egyptian people for a long time -- the need for freedom to associate, freedom to communicate over the Internet, freedom to assemble, the freedom of speech -- and that those must be addressed in a substantive way by the Egyptian government<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not picking between those on the street and those in the government.\xc2\xa0 As the Secretary of State said yesterday, we\'re for and have enumerated our concern for the people of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair and accurate to say that it is the stand of the government that you do not want any kind of transition to be through the toppling of an existing head of state; it should be through resignation or an election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into a series of hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard yesterday very clearly the Secretary of State say there must be an orderly transition, that a whole range of issues -- some of which I just talked about -- have to be addressed, that there has to be meaningful negotiations with a broad cross-section of the Egyptian people including opposition groups that go to answering the very core of the freedoms that people desire.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about those and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak in Cairo about them.\xc2\xa0 Free and fair elections in September for the presidency and for the parliament, constitutional changes that facilitate a more open and more democratic process -- these are some of the things that I know we\'ve spoken directly with the Egyptians about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two others on this, please.\xc2\xa0 The September elections you just referenced -- is it the preference of the U.S. government that Mubarak not run again?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the United States government does not determine who\xe2\x80\x99s on the ballot.\xc2\xa0 The question is whether or not those elections are going to be free and fair.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we would weigh in on and weigh in on strongly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And of all these changes that you talked about that the U.S. government wants, can you give us some more detail perhaps from over the weekend or today about what the government is doing to help make it happen, as opposed to just calling for it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m going to let you report on that. I will say this.\xc2\xa0 As you, I think, know, the President was briefed on the very latest, including readouts, from our embassy and from our ambassador yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Our National Security Advisor held a call with some principals this morning.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on the latest developments as a part of, quite frankly, as most of his daily intelligence briefing.\xc2\xa0 The deputies committee -- there\'s now sort of a standing morning meeting on the situation that was had later this morning, and the President is receiving updates regularly out of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not about appointments; this is about actions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what, I think, people here and people around the world need to see from the Egyptian government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you define what you mean by an orderly transition?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, many of the things I just talked about, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 I talked about -- a transition has to include -- an orderly transition has to include a process of negotiations with a broad cross-section of the Egyptian people, including those that are in the political opposition at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the current government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I don\'t think the grievances are going to be met unless there\xe2\x80\x99s some measure of that involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have to address the freedoms that the people of Egypt seek.\xc2\xa0 And as I said a minute ago, many of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined over the course of the past many days have to be included -- again, free and fair elections; we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the emergency law; again, changes in the constitution that facilitate a more open and democratic process -- all of those things are what must happen in the country in order to transition to something that is more democratic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe President Mubarak is doing that now?\xc2\xa0 Are you happy with this response so far?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is not about appointments; it\xe2\x80\x99s about actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see the actions that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is obvious that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done.\xc2\xa0 I think that is obvious in the pictures that we continue to see from Cairo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you -- what role should the military be playing in this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have had -- I should say this, too.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a number of calls and contacts that happen between our government and counterparts in the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 We are thus far pleased at the restraint that has taken place and encouraged that, even as we see reports of increased participation tomorrow by protesters, that calm and nonviolence once again carry the day on both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s our belief that, first and foremost, this has to be something that\'s conducted with -- through nonviolence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has anybody in the administration been in contact with Mohamed ElBaradei?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the embassy has been in touch with him in the past.\xc2\xa0 I think he is somebody, along with a whole host of people in -- non-governmental voices in -- whether they\xe2\x80\x99re opposition political parties or whether they\xe2\x80\x99re heads of business or banks that we are regularly in touch with.\xc2\xa0 I believe that they will continue to reach out to people like him, and to a whole host of figures -- again, non-governmental and civil society figures to have a discussion with them about what Egypt must do and what Egypt must look like.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the embassy been in touch with him in the last week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, at least when I came in here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make sense for somebody to be in touch with him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that outreach is ongoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Egyptian government in the past has conveyed to the Obama administration and to previous administrations that it suspects that the democracy push from the U.S. might result in something along the lines of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Gaza, and that is an Islamist group being elected and gaining power, in this case the Muslim Brotherhood.\xc2\xa0 How much does the Obama administration agree with that assessment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Jake, I think that -- as I said here last week, I think that it is -- from what we can see, it\xe2\x80\x99s not accurate to say that those protesting are made up of one particular group or one ideology.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is clear that increase in democratic representation has to include a whole host of important non-secular actors that give Egypt a strong chance to continue to be the stable and reliable partner that the world sees in the Middle East.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ElBaradei told ABC News this weekend that the Muslim Brotherhood is no more extremist -- is not an extremist organization and is no different from orthodox Jews in Israel or evangelical Christians in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Does the Obama administration agree with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- without getting into a discussion about them, I think there are certain standards that we believe everybody should adhere to as being part of this process.\xc2\xa0 One that is -- to participate in this ongoing democratic process, one has to take part in it but not use it as a way of simply becoming or taking over that process simply to put themselves in power.\xc2\xa0 We believe that any group should strongly weigh in on the side of non-violence and adherence to the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Orderly transition means change.\xc2\xa0 So by using those words is the administration not admitting that President Mubarak should leave?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Dan, that is -- I do believe orderly transition means change, and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve advocated from the very beginning is that the way Egypt looks and operates must change.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe we should increase the amount of freedom that is had by the Egyptian people on association, on assembly, on speech, on Internet and open communication.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine what the parameters and what the limits of those are.\xc2\xa0 But undoubtedly, transition in this case means change.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s the leader, though, are you not saying that he should be changed or removed from office by saying that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, Dan, that is not for our country or our government to determine.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that people that seek greater freedom are looking for somebody else to pick what and how that change looks like.\xc2\xa0 That is, quite frankly -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t adhere in any way to an open, democratic process that allows for a full discussion and negotiation about what that freedom looks like.\xc2\xa0 Freedom of -- many of the freedoms I just talked about -- the greater economic opportunity, greater economic freedoms -- that\'s not for us to determine.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House has really been ramping up its focus on innovation and jobs.\xc2\xa0 There was a big event today as well.\xc2\xa0 Does what is happening in Egypt distract at all from that push?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.\xc2\xa0 Weather permitting, the President is planning to go later this week to Pennsylvania and continue our push on innovation.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work through all of that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- events happen that any administration and any government have to respond to, but at the same time, much as we dealt with over the previous two years, you have to deal with many things happening at once.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what this administration continues to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final question.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously is getting a lot of updates from his national security team, but is he also bringing in outside advisors to help him --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The National Security Council has regular outreach to experts around the country.\xc2\xa0 I know they had some folks in here earlier today to talk about Egypt as a part of that regular process.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t doubt that, again, at many levels of our government we are talking to many people with insights into Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who were some of those people who came in today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can give you a list of all those.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow, Robert?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is clear today -- public schedule is clear today.\xc2\xa0 Did he clear that schedule so that he could deal with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten -- as far as I know, as of right now, there\xe2\x80\x99s been -- he\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed as part of the PDB on what\xe2\x80\x99s happened and on the discussions that have happened at a principals\xe2\x80\x99 and at a deputies\xe2\x80\x99 level.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that I know that\'s been added to his schedule as a result of what\xe2\x80\x99s gone on over the weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not monitoring this constantly; he\xe2\x80\x99s working on a lot of other stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s working on a lot of stuff.\xc2\xa0 But I will say this, Chip.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s -- we give him updates as the situation dictates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you suspect we\'ll hear from him again sometime in the next few days as this goes on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, I think that depends on some of what happens on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that this transition does not mean that Mubarak would have to go and that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear -- I want to be very clear because I don\'t -- that is not for me to determine.\xc2\xa0 That is not for our government to determine.\xc2\xa0 That is for the people of Egypt to determine.\xc2\xa0 So I have not weighed in on anything other than -- as we have throughout this process -- on the side of the people of Egypt to determine what Egypt looks like in their future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But my question is, are you categorically saying that at no time will the President ever say it\xe2\x80\x99s time for him to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Chip, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stand up here and look that far into the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it may -- it may not be maybe a few days in the future.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re leaving a door open to the possibility of something --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I appreciate the game we\xe2\x80\x99re playing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you not put words in my mouth in either of the three questions that get asked.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing.\xc2\xa0 Are there discussions going on about the possibility, the worries that this could spread in the Middle East?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it is safe to say that what we saw happen in Tunisia we saw certainly had the capabilities to go in other countries.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t generalize, as I said last week, across the spectrum of countries in this region or outside this region because each country is different and at different stages of their political development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without predicting whether you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to, do you feel that the U.S. could work with the Muslim Brotherhood?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, Wendell, that the government of -- we do not have contact with them.\xc2\xa0 And we have, as we have throughout the world, standards for that contact.\xc2\xa0 And those are as I dictated a minute ago.\xc2\xa0 And that is adherence to the law, adherence to non-violence, and a willingness to be part of a democratic process, but not use that democratic process to simply instill yourself into power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they met those standards?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not the current ambassador.\xc2\xa0 I would think that before we had any further contact, we\xe2\x80\x99d want assurances on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some idea of the level of contact between the President\xe2\x80\x99s deputies and their counterparts in Egypt? We know Admiral Mullen has had talks with his counterpart, and the Secretary of State I believe as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think throughout the ranks of the military and over at the Pentagon, obviously between the Secretary of State and the Foreign Ministry.\xc2\xa0 Our ambassador, Margaret Scobey, who we get updates from in his regular meetings about the security situation on the ground.\xc2\xa0 She is obviously in contact with a whole host of entities inside of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, one of our big focuses right now is on authorized departure -- on getting non-essential embassy personnel, their families and others who wish to leave the country on any number of planes that are in Cairo and boarding.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this morning, two of those planes had left, intended for Greece and Turkey.\xc2\xa0 That continues, despite government curfews.\xc2\xa0 We have clearance to get personnel onto those planes and to their destinations, regardless of that curfew.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Only two planes flew out so far today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me be sure.\xc2\xa0 That was as of 11:15 a.m. this morning.\xc2\xa0 I think between six and seven of those planes were on the ground.\xc2\xa0 As soon as they are loaded, they\xe2\x80\x99ll lift off.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final question, if I may.\xc2\xa0 The Israelis gave Egypt permission to secure basically the canal, to place troops in the Sinai, required because of their peace agreement.\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. have any part in that?\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. ask Israel to allow that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I believe that was -- I think that was a direct contact between those two governments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been in contact with Mubarak since Friday, is that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President, the Vice President, as I just mentioned -- there\'s contacts that are happening both throughout the region and throughout the world, some of which we\xe2\x80\x99ve read out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there -- I was just going to say, is there a reason -- has there been no contact made with the King of Jordan or -- is that why he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t included on the readout, or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Some of these contacts we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed and some of these we haven\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of his contacts, the Saudi government put out a readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s phone conversation with the King.\xc2\xa0 And let me read from it directly:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe tragic events taking place currently in Egypt, which have been accompanied by chaos, looting, intimidation of innocents, exploitation of freedom and expression, and attempts to ignite the flames of chaos to achieve their suspicious goals, which are not approved by Saudi, U.S. sides.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair characterization of the phone call?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think each of the readouts are put out based on what each government says on their end of the phone.\xc2\xa0 I think our readout --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if they\xe2\x80\x99re speaking -- they seem to be speaking for -- they said that the U.S. government seemed to agree with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I speak for the U.S. government, Chuck, not anybody --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 So they are wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- not anybody in Riyadh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meaning the Saudi government put out an incorrect readout?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Meaning you should read our readout if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what we said on our end of the phone call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they are sent -- putting out a misleading readout?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will -- happy to forward again the readout that reflects what we said on that end of the phone call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as far as Mubarak is concerned, so when you say orderly transition why is it that you\xe2\x80\x99re hesitating?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that you\xe2\x80\x99re calling -- that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 position is you want an orderly regime change.\xc2\xa0 Is that not correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to be careful because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to put words in my mouth anymore than I want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why -- I mean, orderly transition -- I mean, it seems you\xe2\x80\x99re calling for a change in government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re calling for a change in the way the country works.\xc2\xa0 The determination --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So were Mubarak to implement all that change, you\xe2\x80\x99d be okay with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The determination as to when that change is met or how that change happens is not going to be determined or dictated by our country -- no more, Chuck, than I\xe2\x80\x99m going to determine what freedom of speech means to you or to NBC.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to determine.\xc2\xa0 Why would it be for me to determine for Egypt?\xc2\xa0 Why would anybody who is -- why would anybody who seeks greater freedom in Egypt be looking for my signoff on what that means?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems to be that many of the protesters are upset of the perception that the U.S. government is -- looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s still backing Mubarak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not think that those protesters would be assuaged by the notion that somebody in a series of buildings several thousand miles away have determined the extent to what that means for them.\xc2\xa0 That is for the people of Egypt to decide and determine.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to Connie real quick and then Jonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On evacuations, are military evacuations contemplated?\xc2\xa0 And if --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If American citizens have to get out on a charter but can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a charter, what happens --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken those are -- because of the way the evacuations are taking place -- I will check on -- I guess I would refer you to State on that.\xc2\xa0 I think those are government charters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that White House and the U.S. government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to choose -- or it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to choose the leadership of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 When P.J. Crowley put out a Tweet after Mr. Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s speech on Friday night, saying that \xe2\x80\x9crearranging the deck chairs is not the kind of change he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d a lot of people interpreted that meaning that the appointment of Vice President Suleiman was not an acceptable change.\xc2\xa0 How do you reconcile those two messages?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I reconcile it exactly the way I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it today and exactly the way P.J. Crowley\xe2\x80\x99s boss reconciled it on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- Jonathan, as I said earlier today, I don\'t think anybody is looking at the pictures in Cairo and believes that the actions that have been taken thus far have met that test.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- the Secretary of State I think was asked in each of her five interviews whether or not what has been done is all that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And I think every one of her answers included the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cof course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t -- I think that is -- those largely speak for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow there is a major demonstration planned in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 Have you -- has the U.S. government delivered any kind of message to the Egyptian government specifically on what should be expected of the military\xe2\x80\x99s response to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Simply to reiterate -- again, without getting into great specifics about each of the contacts that are had -- and Wendell -- I think it was Wendell -- mentioned Admiral Mullen and others in the Pentagon, Secretary Gates, that are in touch with their counterparts.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the leadership at the Pentagon, but that is military-to-military contact, the Secretary of State with the Foreign Ministry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have been clear from the outset that grievances will not, and cannot be addressed through violence.\xc2\xa0 So I think that message remains clear to the government of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you assure us that any private back-channel messages to Mubarak or the Egyptian government are the same as what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying publicly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, without getting into what a private back channel might look like.\xc2\xa0 That would make it less private.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 No, our messaging -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the message would be quite clear or have a lot of impact if what I said up here transmitted to people throughout the region was different than what people heard in the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It has.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, that I know of, in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In any of these conversations, any of these briefings that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, how much has the price of oil crept into it?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously close to $90 a barrel.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that it could have broader implications on the economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we -- there are folks obviously in the NEC that are monitoring any impact that uncertainty or unrest has throughout financial markets.\xc2\xa0 We have thus far, to my knowledge, not seen disruptions in, for instance in the Suez, which obviously is tremendously important to the movement of goods around the Cape of Good Horn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Egypt is not an oil exporter, which shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t greatly impact that -- we obviously are monitoring, again, the unrest and the uncertainty to see what impacts that might cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s true for both financial markets and the broader economic recovery?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say financial markets, commodity markets, the whole host of things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you say what kind of counsel the administration is seeking from former Senator Bradley?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 From former Senator Bradley?\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not up on what that might be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- his meeting with the Vice President and Treasury Secretary?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see -- I don\'t know if that\'s tax reform, who -- somebody who played a big role in that.\xc2\xa0 But before I surmise out loud that it might be tax reform, let me check.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x9ctax reform\xe2\x80\x9d -- no, let me just check on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you guys doing tax reform?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sometimes that bubble box appears audibly.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I will have Ms. Brundage check on that right away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said on Friday that the U.S. aid to Egypt was under review.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that?\xc2\xa0 Is there any update on that, in terms of the status of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I said Friday, and I would reiterate here, that we are watching the actions of the government in response to the unrest and would make determinations about our aid based on some of their actions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s ongoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Your message is -- messaging has obviously been done very carefully, as your -- and your words are being picked very carefully.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As opposed to this haphazard briefing?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the considerations and any special efforts that you guys are making to try to carefully pick your words in this crisis, and also, to follow up on Dan, the extent to which you guys -- this is impacting your other efforts at focusing on the economy and the like?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this answer slowly so as to -- no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think -- obviously we understand that this is a volatile region of the world; that it is -- that we have equities, again, in a strong partnership with Egypt and the Egyptian people as they have been a steadying force for peace in the region.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that since the Camp David Accords, and again, that\xe2\x80\x99s been a cornerstone for stability in the region since that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a volatile time.\xc2\xa0 Things and events are moving quickly.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s always important that our words not contributed to the -- contribute to greater volatility.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- as I said earlier, the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule has not changed as a result of what is happening.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he continues to be kept up to date throughout the process.\xc2\xa0 Our travel hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed for later in the week in terms of talking about the issue that Americans have foremost on their mind, and that is the state of the economy.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll continue to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long does President Mubarak have to move?\xc2\xa0 I mean, could he take months and months, outreach to these --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ann, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s determined by the people in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That is -- I think obviously, and I think you heard the President say clearly on Friday and he said this on the phone with President Mubarak, that this was an opportunity that should be seized to make significant change and to bring about significant democratic change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think -- the reason that we talk about the fact that this will be determined by the people of Egypt because this is not something that is -- this is not something where the people of Egypt, again, are going to be satisfied that there is some mystical third party that determines when enough has been done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you heard -- I said this on Friday, the President said this later on Friday, that governments in this country at all levels and governments around the world have to be responsive to their citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask, as well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that your successor, the new press secretary will report to the communications director.\xc2\xa0 Will there be a change in the way your -- the press operation here works?\xc2\xa0 Will the new press secretary be reporting to a communications director, not access directly to the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the modeling that we set up when we came in was, quite honestly, set up a bit like the previous administration\xe2\x80\x99s in some ways.\xc2\xa0 There was a separate -- in some different branches of the Bush administration, there was a communications operation that the press office was within, and sometimes when it was a separate office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan can stick his head out of his door and I can hear it pretty clearly in my office, and vice versa.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\'t think anybody has to worry that the operation of -- the press operation will act differently simply by combining the efforts of press and communication, largely because, quite honestly, I think if you looked at it -- and Dan and others and I have discussed this -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a myriad of roles that are very duplicative.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, for instance, we have assistant press secretaries that have split up a series of issues that you all interact with them.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s a homeland security issue, you deal with Nick.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s an economic issue, you deal with Amy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a separate group of people in communications that works at the EEOB that they\xe2\x80\x99re regional -- basically they\xe2\x80\x99re regional desks.\xc2\xa0 They have the country split up, but they\'re answering many of the same questions.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think you have to fear that things are going to act differently with Jay up here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the new press secretary have your office?\xc2\xa0 In a former Democratic administration, the communications director took your office and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I have not been told otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I want to follow up on the issue of marriage and the President\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 statement.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll read it again:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI favor legalizing same-sex marriages and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why has the President abandoned this position?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can simply -- I was not with the President in 1996.\xc2\xa0 I was younger and thinner back then -- same shoe size.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that I think that throughout the campaign of 2004 and the campaign of 2008, he\xe2\x80\x99s made his position clear on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a political motivation for the President to drop support for same-sex marriage as he pursued to higher office?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my previous answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One follow-up question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s two actually, but go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll entertain the second.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President reclaim his support for same-sex marriage before the 2012 election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the business of predicting.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this President be clearly committed to issues of equality and justice.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why in -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to 2012.\xc2\xa0 I can speak to 2011 as the year in which a policy like \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d will end.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the indication for this administration that the Egyptian people are satisfied with the degree of change that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be when the protests end in the streets, or when some --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My sense is -- look, I hate to get into, again, predicting this.\xc2\xa0 But I think you would see -- you\xe2\x80\x99d see broad agreement in Egypt that the cares and concerns of those that have manifested themselves in these protests, that some of those grievances have been met.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s why I think many people throughout the world think that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached that level yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a slightly separate question -- very different question about the ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting over the weekend about the potential for him to run in 2012.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that that might affect the work that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing for a major U.S. ally -- economic issues and otherwise over the next couple of months?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Huntsman has told a number -- told several people inside this building that he plans to leave in the first part of -- during the first part of this year.\xc2\xa0 When the President picked him in 2009, it was because we believed, and continue to believe, he brings a broad range of experience to an extremely important ambassadorial post with one of our most important relationships in the world.\xc2\xa0 The President continues to believe that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reporting on this today, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I want to be clear on this from up here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to several people in the building, and I have not heard anybody say they know what the future holds for Ambassador Huntsman, except to say, as I said earlier, that he will leave sometime in the first part of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, and I think the American people, expect that somebody that holds the post of ambassador from the United States to China would dedicate their full energy and time to that position.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that Ambassador Huntsman believes that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House been preparing to find a replacement for him since --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that when he started telling people in the building that he\xe2\x80\x99d step down, that that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that has begun, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it Vietor?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is not.\xc2\xa0 I can take him off the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on Egypt, two questions, and following up a couple of people.\xc2\xa0 You said that Egypt has been a cornerstone for that region since the Camp David Accords.\xc2\xa0 What is this administration\xe2\x80\x99s greatest fear with all of this lawlessness?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, let me rephrase what you -- some of what you said there.\xc2\xa0 I think they have been a valuable partner in the region in bringing about stability.\xc2\xa0 I think the Camp David Accords have provided the cornerstone for that stability.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- well, it is our hope and our strong belief that that is a role that Egypt will continue to play for a long time going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is the fear?\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s greatest fear?\xc2\xa0 This is a country that you have greatly relied on, you\xe2\x80\x99ve helped but greatly reliant on.\xc2\xa0 And all the volatility --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you can largely assume that our fears are the opposite of partnership and stability.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, back to what Hans asked about the barrel of oil -- the price of a barrel of oil.\xc2\xa0 You say the NEC is following it.\xc2\xa0 But what is the rationale, especially since they are not exporters of oil and the fact that when other countries that do export oil, particularly like in Nigeria, gas prices go up -- why now?\xc2\xa0 What is the rationale?\xc2\xa0 What is the NEC telling us as to why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there is a certain amount of volatility that\xe2\x80\x99s always built into oil prices and we know oil prices also -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to surmise deeply on this lest I get myself in trouble -- that as I said to Hans, there are -- that we watch for uncertainty and instability and whatever its impact might be on prices through a range of different commodities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to any strong determinations except that it is something that we are, as you can imagine, for our economy and for the recovery of the global economy, watching quite closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a fear about transportation, moving of oil back and forth in that region -- is there a fear with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I said earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not received reports, at least when I came out here, that there were -- that there seemed to be transportation disruptions in the area of the Suez.\xc2\xa0 But again, that is -- I think that is among the many concerns that we will, throughout the government, continue to monitor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I also have a couple of Egypt follow-up questions.\xc2\xa0 Who inside the NSC or the EOP is actually managing this for the White House?\xc2\xa0 Is this John Brennan or is it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, this is -- the process is -- John has certainly been part of a number of these meetings.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Donilon who is the principal on this, has been in virtually every one of these meetings, updated the President in a meeting we were all in on Saturday, obviously is in the PDB.\xc2\xa0 Denis runs some of the deputy committee meetings that are also held on a daily basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you give me an idea of how many staff or basically full-time or close to full-time are on this now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the NSC is largely divided up into regional issues.\xc2\xa0 So when we go into these meetings, you see the same people that are dealing with issues throughout the Middle East obviously in these meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden was really involved in Iraq, obviously was involved in the AfPak -- and we saw in the picture when the President was on the phone with Mr. Mubarak on Friday.\xc2\xa0 What\'s Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s role in this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, obviously, the Vice President brings decades of experience in dealing with issues in foreign policy, and knows many of the actors in the region well.\xc2\xa0 He, as you mentioned, was in the Oval Office during the call to President Mubarak on Friday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 He has been a regular participant, as his staff has, in all of these meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 The Associated Press today says --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- administration officials, apparently not White House officials -- talking about those two terms that we talked about at the top of this briefing, the election in September and the lifting of emergency laws.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, did the President personally urge Mubarak on their call to proceed on both of those fronts, or are these recommendations that are occurring at lower levels?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- without getting myself into reading out the precise words that are used in those diplomatic calls, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you largely back to the answer I gave Mark in that the public -- our public messaging and our private messaging on changes that need to take place are remarkably similar.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got the sense that what you meant was that they were not contradictory.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean -- when obviously this would be a choice that the President would have to calculate, is this what I -- do I want to get involved in at this level and make these personal recommendations.\xc2\xa0 But can you tell us whether he did --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, without -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m very reticent to read my notes from the call.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think when I outline up here many of the things that you heard the President has talked about throughout the many meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s had over the course of the past couple of years and in the speech in Cairo -- things like free and fair elections, constitutional change -- the freedoms that we\xe2\x80\x99ve enumerated I think are all very consistent with messaging that is being delivered at all levels of our government throughout all levels of Egyptian government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 What would you say to the Egyptian demonstrators watching you now and they infer a subtle support for Mubarak to stay in office and they respond to the steps you mention, and they would say we\xe2\x80\x99ve given Mubarak 30 years and they just -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t trust him to meet those reforms?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think first and foremost what I would say to anybody watching is that the United States and the Obama administration are fully supportive of your universal rights.\xc2\xa0 And look, this country was founded on the principle of grievances with government and having -- setting about a constitution that addresses a process for those grievances to be heard.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that has to happen in this instance, as well.\xc2\xa0 And it is not for anybody in this government or anybody at this podium to determine how or when those grievances have been met.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody listening in Cairo or anywhere else in Egypt wants somebody in this country determining what\xe2\x80\x99s the definition in Egypt for freedom of assembly.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody in this country would want that from Egypt, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody in Egypt wants that from this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we want is a meaningful dialogue to happen that results in significant democratic changes.\xc2\xa0 When those changes and when those grievances -- when those grievances have been met through those changes, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll know that from the people of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, who do you expect to be at the table there?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, who do you guys -- who do you expect to be at a table for this meeting on meaningful dialogue?\xc2\xa0 Is it ElBaradei? Is it representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess -- like how does he do this?\xc2\xa0 Who are the people at the table?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This has to be determined by the people in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 But, again, if we determine who sits at that table, we by definition are making decisions about the extent to which freedom looks like in that country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously we have a lot of Egyptian experts here who are the types of people who --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, as I said, that that has to include many of the people that the embassy and others talk to regularly in Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s those folks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It has to -- well, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to narrow-cast --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that certainly -- there are certainly political actors that are currently not members of the government, some level of those -- of opposition groups, certainly meeting the standard that we laid out earlier about adherence to democratic principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think obviously that that can\xe2\x80\x99t simply include political players.\xc2\xa0 It has to include, as I said earlier, those in business, those in banking, those in commerce.\xc2\xa0 There has to be a broad enough cross-section of the Egyptian people to weigh in on the extent to which these grievances are held and that they will be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to follow up on that point, has there been conversations between people in the administration or in the embassy and anyone in Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s government about a way to proceed?\xc2\xa0 If there are these conversations, who are some of the people that might be involved, whether the U.S. can help or not\xc2\xa0 --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that we have weighed in on the broader notion of what that needs to look like.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- and I\'ll double-check to see if there\'s any more clarity, largely because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been read into each and every one of those conversations -- but the degree to which that gets quite that granular.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is -- I think it has to -- as I mentioned, it has to include a broad cross-section.\xc2\xa0 It has to include people that represent those that have those grievances.\xc2\xa0 And I think whenever you begin to narrow-cast this -- only this, not this, you\xe2\x80\x99re restricting that lens in a way that, again, is not a determination that this government will make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Savannah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to -- if you could just square --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just one question, one question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, Lester, hold on.\xc2\xa0 I called on Savannah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you could just kind of square these two concepts -- because on the one hand you\xe2\x80\x99re saying don\xe2\x80\x99t read the \xe2\x80\x9corderly transition to democracy\xe2\x80\x9d as saying we believe Mubarak should step down because it\xe2\x80\x99s not for the U.S. to insert itself in Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s internal affairs.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, you\xe2\x80\x99ve just described a variety of changes that have to be made in Egypt, including the emergency law being lifted, which sounds exactly like the U.S. is meddling or weighing in on Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s internal affairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 And I think the Secretary of State was clear on a number of these things over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been the position of this government through Democratic and Republican administrations that greater freedoms, greater democratic reforms, greater adherence to human rights needed to be part of what Egypt looked like.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have, as a government, Democrat and Republican, advocated for the position of a vice president for the length of President Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s term because up until Saturday, for that 31 years, there never had been.\xc2\xa0 We spoke out in I think September of this year as the emergency law was again extended, something that\'s been several decades -- has been in place for several decades -- that we believed, Democratic and Republican administrations believed that that provided the government with extra judicial powers that were unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those are in accordance with the values that we hold, and the universal rights of the people of Egypt that we support.\xc2\xa0 But it is not, again, for us to delineate that the only thing that has to happen is X, Y and Z.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s not a -- I think that is important that we not make that determination on behalf of people halfway across the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President appointed by Hosni Mubarak, Omar Suleiman, presided over -- presides over the intelligence apparatus in Egypt that has had a reputation for torturing people, but also has had a reputation for being a close intelligence ally of the U.S., may have helped, indeed, the U.S. with rendering suspects during that last administration, though not now.\xc2\xa0 Has part of the communication about changes that the West would like to see include a reform of the security service, a declaration against torture and promise to end those practices?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I know obviously as you mentioned it is the position of our government not to torture.\xc2\xa0 It is our strong belief that that goes against many of the universal rights that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 I do not know the level, again, of granularity that has taken place in the discussions that have happened at different levels of government since Vice President Suleiman was sworn in.\xc2\xa0 Again, I can just speak again broadly to those universal rights and what they must look like.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Mayor Michael Bloomberg has sent undercover investigators from New York into Arizona where they were --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it has been -- I have not seen the reports, Sam, and I will have somebody go pull that.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, we are -- we believe that there are reasons that federal laws are on the books, and the need to strongly adhere to and follow existing law is important not just in the purchase of weapons but throughout our civil life.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:54 P.M.
