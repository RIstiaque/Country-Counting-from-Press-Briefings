Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:55 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I apologize for the late start today. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Almost. \xc2\xa0I do not have anything at the top, Kevin, so we can go straight to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, Josh. \xc2\xa0So I was wondering if the White House had any feedback on how it felt about how it went this morning in the landmark immigration case. \xc2\xa0Chief Justice Roberts asked questions suggesting he could side with the administration if there were some small changes in the proposed programs; others were more pointed about whether the President had usurped Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, I think -- and those of you who covered the two Supreme Court cases to consider the constitutionality of the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care reform law will remember how unwise it is to try to draw conclusions about the likely decision of the Supreme Court based solely on the questioning of the justices. \xc2\xa0In fact, I remember that there were a number of legal pundits that emerged with some egg on their face after offering up some rather dire predictions about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s argument after watching the questioning, only to see a favorable ruling in the end.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to withhold any prognostications on the part of the administration and just reiterate our continued confidence in the power of the legal argument that the Solicitor General presented to the Court today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you speak as to why the President signed off on the U.S. deploying 200 additional troops to Iraq, and to sending Apache helicopters for the first time into the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq? \xc2\xa0Is this a short-term increase? \xc2\xa0Did the Pentagon indicate that was the right number?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you that Secretary Carter is traveling in the region today; he was in Iraq today meeting with Iraqi officials to discuss these enhancements to our counter-ISIL campaign. \xc2\xa0All of the work that takes place in Iraq by the United States military is closely coordinated with the Iraqi government and Iraqi forces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, Iraq is a sovereign nation, and making decisions like retaking Mosul from ISIL will be decisions that are made by the Iraqi government. \xc2\xa0What the United States has sought to do at every turn is to support our partners in Iraq as they implement a political strategy to unite the country, but also as they carry out a military strategy to drive ISIL out of those areas of Iraq where they have encroached.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s instructions to his national security team have consistently been to look for opportunities to reinforce those elements of our campaign that are showing some progress. \xc2\xa0And the announcements that Secretary Carter made earlier today are consistent with that instruction from the President, and these enhancements are consistent with recommendations that the President received from his military advisors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you confirm whether the First Lady and the girls are going to be going on any part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Tim, as you may have seen, the First Lady will join the President for part of his trip in the UK. \xc2\xa0But for more details on the travel of the First Family, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s Office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the oil producer talks in Doha fell apart last night. \xc2\xa0Is there any concern -- is the administration concerned that Saudi Arabia could embark on another effort to gain market share and the oil price would go down and that that would hurt U.S. producers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Tim, at this point, obviously the United States and our economists pay close attention to fluctuations in the global oil market, and we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware of the kinds of political efforts that are underway -- or some of the political efforts by oil producers to coordinate their activities to maximize the economic standing of their individual countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re aware of all of that going on. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly conscious of the fact that it has an impact on the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0But at least from here, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on any decisions made by any individual countries with regard to their oil production activities. \xc2\xa0I can just tell you that the administration has been very focused on energy security here in the United States. \xc2\xa0That is part of the strategy that has led us to a situation where the United States is producing significant quantities of both oil and natural gas here domestically in a way that does bring some important stability to our broader economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been focused on a strategy that includes increases in energy efficiency. \xc2\xa0We certainly have seen important increases in energy efficiency when it comes to cars and trucks that are on the road here in the United States. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been focused on looking for other ways to generate energy, renewable energy like wind and solar.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo those kinds of investments have paid off in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s been good for the U.S. economy both in the short run, and stands to only expand its potential economic benefit in the decades ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the last time the Saudis embarked on this and just started opening a tap a couple years ago, it sent the price down, and the U.S. is now producing only at 2009 levels. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned that this could hurt U.S. jobs?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Tim, again, I don\'t think I would comment on any individual decisions or even potential decisions to be made by other countries. \xc2\xa0I\'ll just note that this is a welcome respite from the first six or seven years when I sat behind this podium and had to answer questions from your colleagues or other news organizations that asked whether or not the United States was concerned about the impact that high oil prices would have on the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0So I wouldn\'t speculate either about what impact low oil prices would have on the U.S. economy, but the tenor of this conversation certainly seems preferable to the tenor of those conversations in earlier years.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one on the bridge that Russia is building to Crimea. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s some support on both sides. \xc2\xa0Even in Crimea, there\xe2\x80\x99s some at this point hoping that the isolation will be less if the bridge is built. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money -- $3.2 billion. \xc2\xa0Is this money that President Putin could be spending better elsewhere?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have a lot of information about their development plans, and obviously I wouldn\'t second-guess any independent decisions that the Russian government is going to make as it relates to infrastructure. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the President continues to make a forceful case to President Putin that he should abide by the commitments that he made in the context of the Minsk talks. \xc2\xa0And I can tell you that President Obama had a conversation with President Putin today on this exact issue. \xc2\xa0The two leaders spoke this morning, and we\'ll have a more robust readout of their call later today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the United States continues to believe, and President Obama continues to make a forceful case that Russia needs to abide by their commitments. \xc2\xa0And by doing so, they can begin to relieve some of the isolation that they have sustained as a result of interfering in the sovereign activities of their neighbors in Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You say the phone call was mostly on Crimea, or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The telephone conversation did spend a lot of time focused on the situation in Ukraine. \xc2\xa0There also was a rather intense discussion, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, around the situation in Syria. \xc2\xa0But like I said, we\'ll have more details on the phone conversation later today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say if President Obama raised the issue of the buzzing of the U.S. warship in the Baltic earlier last week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I asked this specific question and that did not come up in the call between the two Presidents. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned yesterday, those kinds of activities are destabilizing, a source of some concern, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not particularly unusual. \xc2\xa0And there is an already well-established channel for expressing our concerns about those kinds of incidents from the U.S. military attach\xc3\xa9 in Moscow to his Russian military counterpart. \xc2\xa0Those concerns were raised at that level and were not escalated beyond that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was another incident over the weekend where a Russian aircraft intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane. \xc2\xa0Has a complaint been lodged by usual channels on that incident?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mark, I think this is a good illustration of just how these kinds of incidents, while provocative and concerning, are not particularly unusual. \xc2\xa0And I do not know at this point whether or not specific concerns have been raised about the incident that you just referenced. \xc2\xa0But it is a good illustration that these kinds of actions are not particularly unusual.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry said last week in an interview that the United States would be within its justification to have fired on those two aircraft that repeatedly buzzed the warship in the Baltic. \xc2\xa0Did you see those remarks, and did he represent the White House view?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those remarks. \xc2\xa0I think the point that Secretary Kerry was making is that those kinds of actions are provocative. \xc2\xa0And it\'s certainly why we encourage the Russians to not engage in those kinds of activities. \xc2\xa0Abiding by generally accepted international norms, particularly when operating in either international waters or in international airspace, is important. \xc2\xa0But again, since we have ample opportunities to express our concerns about these kinds of provocative actions to the Russians, it did not necessitate a presidential-level conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to go back to a couple things you just said. \xc2\xa0This phone conversation with President Obama and Putin, how intense was the conversation? \xc2\xa0You said it was an intense conversation. \xc2\xa0And what components were the intense pieces?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\'m going to get into that much detail. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I used the word "tense."<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said "intense."<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Intense.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I\'m using a piece of "intense." \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0How tense --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that distorts the meaning of what I\'m trying to convey.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- not distort. \xc2\xa0Tell me, how intense was it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\'m telling you is that there are important issues for the two leaders to discuss, and they had an opportunity to discuss them at some length this morning. \xc2\xa0And obviously when we\'re talking about the situation in Syria, it\'s rather serious, and there continues to be concern about all of the parties living up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd obviously we have for years now encouraged President Putin and the Russian government to use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to compel them to act constructively. And more recently that means to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities, and that abiding by that arrangement around the cessation of hostilities is going to be critical to our ability to move forward on the diplomatic track and bring about the kind of political transition that\'s long overdue inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd President Putin has publicly expressed his view that this kind of political transition is critical to both Russian and U.S. interests in that country and in the broader region. \xc2\xa0And this is an opportunity where our interests overlap, and it\'s an opportunity for the President to once again make the case to President Putin that he should use his influence with the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they\'ve made in the context of the cessation of hostilities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUnfortunately, we\'ve seen that the cessation of hostilities continues to be fragile and increasingly threatened due to continued violations by the regime. \xc2\xa0And this was the subject of what I think you could accurately describe as an intense conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there more consternation that resulted from this meeting, from this phone conversation between the two? \xc2\xa0Were they at an impasse with the intense conversation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe it as an impasse. \xc2\xa0It\'s not uncommon for them to have these kinds of conversations. And this is an opportunity for them to consult on these important matters once again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, going back to the Merrick nomination, it\'s been said now from some members on Capitol Hill that the President did reach out to some members of the Congressional Black Caucus as they were still angry about the fact that -- upset about the fact that a black person or a black female was not nominated. \xc2\xa0And I know a couple of people, to include Congressman James Clyburn, the President actually reached out to and talked to. \xc2\xa0Could you talk to us about some of those calls that the President made and the talks that he had with members of the CBC?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not aware of any conversations like that that have occurred recently. \xc2\xa0The President did address this at some length when he traveled to the University of Chicago a week and a half ago. \xc2\xa0The President talked about his unparalleled record of appointing people to the federal bench to ensure that that institution reflects the diversity of the country. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve been through the statistics before about what the President\'s record looks like. \xc2\xa0The President has appointed 117 minority judges. \xc2\xa0That\'s more than any President in history. \xc2\xa0Nine African American circuit court judges, which is as many as any other President in history. \xc2\xa0Twenty-six African American female judges. \xc2\xa0Thirty-seven Hispanic judges. \xc2\xa0Twenty judges from the APIA community. \xc2\xa0All of those are totals that exceed any other President in American history.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn this case, the President made a decision that is consistent with the way that he made this decision in the past, which is, when the President appointed Justice Sotomayor, the first Hispanic to the Supreme Court, he picked the best person for the job. \xc2\xa0He picked someone of unquestioned integrity, somebody with unquestioned legal credentials, and somebody with a commitment to interpreting the law and not advancing a political agenda. \xc2\xa0He used the same criteria to choose Elena Kagan and nominate her to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And he used that same criteria to choose Merrick Garland.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s why we\'re going to continue to urge the Senate to fulfill their constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0Obviously, Republicans in the Senate described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee, and we believe that he should be treated accordingly.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And last question. \xc2\xa0You said from that podium that this administration listened to their constituency when it came to the potential nominee. \xc2\xa0And we had black leaders who submitted the request for an African American or black person or a black woman. \xc2\xa0Now, Lani Guinier -- I talked to her last week \xc2\xa0-- she was of a mind that if you had picked an African American woman, she would have a tough year, just like she did in 1993. \xc2\xa0When you laid out all the requests and looked at the landscape, was that part of the equation -- that if you did nominate an African American woman, you might have gotten the same thing that you were seeing when Clinton nominated Lani Guinier in 1993?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was any previous presidential appointment that came to mind. \xc2\xa0I think in this case, the President was focused on fulfilling his constitutional responsibility. \xc2\xa0And the President was convinced that the American people would be best served by the President choosing the very best person for the job, and that\'s exactly what he\'s done. \xc2\xa0The President chose somebody, in the form of Chief Judge Garland, who is the chief judge on the second highest court in the land. \xc2\xa0Chief Judge Garland has more experience on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s why we\'ve seen Republicans describe him in the past as being a consensus nominee. \xc2\xa0And just in the last week, we heard Republican Senator Rob Portman, from Ohio, describe Chief Judge Garland as "an impressive guy." \xc2\xa0You heard Republican Senator Pay Toomey, from Pennsylvania, describe Chief Judge Garland as very, very smart and very knowledgeable. \xc2\xa0Last week, Senator Flake described Chief Judge Garland as \xe2\x80\x9cobviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So many Republicans have reached the same kind of conclusion that President Obama has about the ability of Chief Judge Garland to serve on the Supreme Court with honor and distinction in a lifetime appointment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s the assessment that people make when they set aside politics. \xc2\xa0It\'s only when politics intrude that Republicans step forward and say that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to consider anybody that\'s been appointed by President Obama. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that because they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned with who President Obama appointed. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re doing that because they are in a different political party than President Barack Obama. \xc2\xa0That intrusion of partisan politics into the Supreme Court process is not good for our country. \xc2\xa0It\'s inconsistent with most Americans\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of the Constitution. \xc2\xa0It\'s also inconsistent with most Americans\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of what the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s job is. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s why I think you have seen some traction around this argument that Republicans are not doing their job. \xc2\xa0They have failed. \xc2\xa0They have dropped the ball when it comes to fulfilling their responsibility to consider the appointment that the President has thoughtfully put forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI guess one thing that I can tell you is that there are some meetings that Chief Judge Garland will participate in this week. He will do meetings with five different senators over the course of this week. \xc2\xa0On Tuesday, he\'ll meet with Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. \xc2\xa0On Wednesday, Chief Judge Garland will meet with Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Nelson -- those will be separate meetings. \xc2\xa0And then on Thursday, Chief Judge Garland -- although it would be interesting if they did it together, I guess. \xc2\xa0But they will be separate. \xc2\xa0And then on Thursday, Chief Judge Garland will meet with Senator Menendez and Senator Kaine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo at the end of this week, Chief Judge Garland will have met with, I believe that will bring the total to 40 United States senators, including 10 Republican United States senators. \xc2\xa0So he continues to fulfill his responsibility to engage with members of Congress. \xc2\xa0These kinds of private meetings have long been a precursor to a more public hearing -- or a public hearing. \xc2\xa0And this is the case that we\'re going to continue to make, that when you hear Republicans say that they don\'t want a hearing, frankly it\'s because they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned that Chief Judge Garland is going to do well in a hearing and they don\'t want the American people to be left with the impression that this individual deserves a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court because it\'s then going to make it harder -- even harder than it already is -- for them to block his nomination.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'re going to continue to make the case that Republicans in the Senate should do their job, and hopefully they will.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on the 28 pages of the 9/11 report. \xc2\xa0You said last week that you\xe2\x80\x99d check to see if the President had actually read those pages. \xc2\xa0I\'m just wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to get that answer, if he does support declassifying those pages.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s read the 28 pages. \xc2\xa0Obviously there is a process that\'s underway at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to consider those 28 pages and determine how much, if any, of those documents can be declassified and released. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a well-established process for this, and I\'d refer you to Director Clapper\xe2\x80\x99s office for an update on where that process stands and how soon a decision about a potential release could be made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to 9/11 families who feel that, by opposing the Schumer-Cornyn legislation that the administration is siding with Saudi Arabia instead of with the victims?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, our concerns about this law are not related to its impact on our relationship with one particular country. \xc2\xa0In fact, our concern is about an important principle of international law. \xc2\xa0The whole notion of sovereign immunity is at stake and it is one that has more significant consequences for the United States than any other country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe concern that we have is simply this: \xc2\xa0It could put the United States and our taxpayers and our servicemembers and our diplomats at significant risk if countries were -- other countries were to adopt a similar law. \xc2\xa0Let me give you one example. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the United States is involved in a wide variety of humanitarian relief efforts in countries around the world at any given time. \xc2\xa0If somebody decided that they wanted to -- that they were unhappy with the way that those humanitarian relief efforts were being carried out, you can imagine someone in some faraway country would file a lawsuit against the United States for our humanitarian relief efforts.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis, again, could potentially put the United States and our taxpayers at risk. \xc2\xa0It could also put individual U.S. servicemembers who are often involved in those humanitarian efforts at risk as well. \xc2\xa0That\'s why this principle of sovereign immunity is critically important. \xc2\xa0It allows countries to resolve their differences through diplomacy and not through the courts in one country or the other. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe continue to believe that the concerns that we have with Saudi Arabia can be addressed through diplomacy. \xc2\xa0Of course, they\xe2\x80\x99re an important counterterrorism partner to the United States. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of areas where we work closely together -- everything from trying to resolve the situation in Syria to degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL, to fighting al-Qaeda in Yemen, or to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s malign activities in the region. \xc2\xa0Those are all areas where the United States and Saudi Arabia work effectively together in a way that advances our shared interests. \xc2\xa0But we surely do not agree on everything. \xc2\xa0But our differences are differences that can be resolved through diplomacy and don\'t have to be resolved in a way that opens up the United States to significant potential vulnerability in a whole host of countries around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And do you expect that this issue, both the legislation and the 28 pages, will be brought up later this week when the President meets with the King?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t know at this point. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know that they will necessarily be on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there are a lot of important things for us to discuss. \xc2\xa0I outlined a few of them, particularly as it relates to Iran and ISIL and even the situation in Yemen. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President convened Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries at Camp David last May, and at that summit, the President was focused on helping the GCC countries improve their coordination and cooperation so that they can work more effectively together in cooperation to advance their security interests. \xc2\xa0And the United States can certainly play a helpful role in facilitating that cooperation, both using our expertise, but in some cases, offering our technology and equipment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we obviously have a long agenda when we get there. \xc2\xa0But, look, if this issue were to come up, obviously I think the situation that I have described in terms of the potential consequences of rolling back this core principle of international law is how the President would explain our position to his counterpart.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one question on Zika. \xc2\xa0If Congress does not go ahead and approve the $1.9 billion in funding that you\'re asking for, what\xe2\x80\x99s plan B, or what comes next? \xc2\xa0Dr. Fauci, over the weekend, said you would have to pull from other areas to continue for that vaccine development that\'s underway. \xc2\xa0Have you started the process to identify what other areas you could draw funding from?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to both Dr. Frieden at CDC and Dr. Fauci at NIH for a detailed answer to that question. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that what both of them have done as a matter of just being responsible public health professionals is they\xe2\x80\x99ve been forced to prioritize. \xc2\xa0And that has meant pulling resources away from some core priorities to focus on this emerging threat.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s a significant problem, particularly when you consider that there\xe2\x80\x99s no good reason that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t acted. \xc2\xa0This is not right now an urgent situation. \xc2\xa0For the last two months, it\'s been a situation that\'s called for congressional action. \xc2\xa0That\'s why we put forward a detailed proposal for members of Congress to act on. \xc2\xa0Instead, Republicans in Congress have done little to nothing to address this issue for the last two months. \xc2\xa0And the opportunity to get ahead of this potentially serious situation is washing away. \xc2\xa0And that\'s a significant problem. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ve already seen our public health experts do the responsible thing and begin to focus on what resources can be used to address the threat from Zika, but they are insufficient. And we need Congress to fulfill its responsibility to put the public health and well-being of the American people first, and to act on the Zika funding request that we put forward now nearly two months ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSuzanne.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to go back to Saudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0Would the President veto legislation allowing relatives of the victims of 9/11 who would sue the Saudi government or other foreign entities who were shown to be directly involved in the 9/11 attacks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Suzanne, given the long list of concerns that I\'ve expressed about rolling back this core principle of international law, it\'s difficult to imagine a scenario in which the President would sign the bill as it\'s currently drafted. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, the President has devoted significant time in office to fighting for the 9/11 families, and fighting for those who risked their lives to rescue and rebuild after 9/11, particularly at Ground Zero. \xc2\xa0So the priority that the President places on these issues is well-documented, and what the President believes is that the most effective way for us to advance our interests, particularly as it relates to countering violent extremism and countering terrorist organizations around the world, is for us to use our American military where necessary to protect the American people, but to try to work cooperatively with other countries around the world to advance our shared interests. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd since 9/11, we have seen a genuine focus on the part of the Saudis to countering those who seek to profligate extremist ideology. \xc2\xa0We recognize, and the Saudis now recognize, just how dangerous that is. \xc2\xa0And the United States and Saudi Arabia now work together to counter those who seek to advance these ideologies. \xc2\xa0And we do that in a way that demonstrates the ability of our two nations to cooperate, particularly on issues that are important to the national security of the citizens in both our countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Saudis have threatened to sell billions of U.S. assets if the legislation passes. \xc2\xa0Is the President going to address that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that this issue is going to come up in their meetings, in part because I\'m confident that the Saudis recognize, just as much as we do, our shared interest in preserving the stability of the global financial system.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the administration -- I mean, what is the response to that threat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I feel confident in telling you that the Saudis recognize the shared interest that the United States and Saudi Arabia have in protecting the stability of the international financial system.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the administration dismissing the threat?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve been pretty clear in answering your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another topic -- the bus explosion in Jerusalem, there\'s been conflicting reports in terms of an explosion regarding a terrorist threat or if it was something mechanical. \xc2\xa0Do you have anything?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any firsthand information about this. \xc2\xa0Obviously we\'re aware of those reports, and law enforcement officials in Israel are taking a close look at this, as they should. \xc2\xa0And I\'m confident that they\'ll take a close look at this and that U.S. officials will stay in touch with them on this matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And back to immigration. \xc2\xa0At the Supreme Court today, outside, there were many undocumented immigrants who really wanted to know from the administration what they should do. \xc2\xa0If the Supreme Court comes back and supports the administration\'s deferred action programs, knowing that this is something that could be changed or reversed under a Republican administration, whether or not that they should, in fact, come out of the shadows with just months away from potentially facing that kind of risk. \xc2\xa0Is there advice or guidance that the administration is giving to those people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point we\'re going to wait and see what the Supreme Court decides. \xc2\xa0That\'s what our process -- that\'s what our legal process dictates. \xc2\xa0And obviously the U.S. government and the Obama administration has been deeply engaged in that process, and we have made strong arguments before the courts about the wisdom of this approach. \xc2\xa0We\'ve also made strong arguments about how the approach that President Obama has pursued to use this executive authority to bring greater accountability to our immigration system is consistent with the way that President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush used their executive authority. \xc2\xa0Both of those Presidents used their executive authority to offer relief to undocumented immigrants, and offered them the opportunity to get a job in the United States. \xc2\xa0And that was relief that was granted to about 40 percent of the undocumented population in the United States at the time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPresident Obama has used the same authority to do exactly the same kind of thing. \xc2\xa0That\'s why we continue to be confident in the persuasiveness of the arguments that we have made before the courts. \xc2\xa0But at this point, it\'s unclear exactly what impact this will have on the policy process and in our ability to implement this policy decision that the President and his team have made here. \xc2\xa0So once we have greater clarity from the Supreme Court, we\'ll be able to offer clearer guidance to those who are eager to get that relief.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you said to ask Director Clapper about the 28 pages, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t this a decision that is of such magnitude that it would be decided by the President, himself, eventually?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, this is something that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is handling consistent with the well-established process for declassifying sensitive national security material.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But won\'t the President make the decision himself eventually?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not necessarily. \xc2\xa0This is something that our intelligence community does routinely. \xc2\xa0And at this point, I would --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\'s nothing routine about this. \xc2\xa0I mean, this is a major document. \xc2\xa0This isn\xe2\x80\x99t just another classified document that they have to decide whether to declassify or not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I would acknowledge that there is something -- that this is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Unique --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\'s significant because it relates to obviously the biggest terrorist attack that\'s been carried out on American soil. \xc2\xa0So it\'s obviously something that the intelligence community takes quite seriously, but they take all these matters quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And there\'s a well-established \xc2\xa0--<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you going to say the President, himself, may not make this decision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\'m saying is that there is a well-established process that the intelligence community has for considering these kinds of questions. \xc2\xa0And right now that is the process that we\'re in the middle of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the Supreme Court -- do you think -- or does the President think -- and maybe you\'ve addressed this before; I\'m not here all the time now -- but does the President think that decisions of this level of importance should be postponed until there are nine members on the Supreme Court?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President believes that it\'s the Supreme Court\'s responsibility to determine how this should be best handled. \xc2\xa0Obviously it was President Reagan who was pretty outspoken in making the case that these kinds of cases should be handled with the full complement of justices. \xc2\xa0I\'m just looking for the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does President Obama agree with President Reagan on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He most assuredly does. \xc2\xa0And look, for every day that goes by that the Supreme Court does not have the full complement of justices, the American people are not best served by their legal system. \xc2\xa0And that is the argument that President Reagan made in urging the United States Senate to act on his nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0That was action that he was urging them to take in his final year in office. \xc2\xa0It was an election year. \xc2\xa0It was President Reagan\'s final year in office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s exactly the situation that we have now. \xc2\xa0When President Reagan was in office and he made that case, Democrats has the majority in the Senate, and they went along with it. \xc2\xa0They recognized that they had a constitutional duty to confirm Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court, and that\'s what they did. \xc2\xa0We\'re simply asking Republicans to do exactly the same thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President been briefed by Don Verrilli on the Supreme Court case today? \xc2\xa0Do you know?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President -- he has not been briefed by the Solicitor General, at least not today. \xc2\xa0But I would anticipate that the President will get briefed by his staff about how the arguments went before the Supreme Court before the end of the day today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And do you know if the President has voiced -- or if anybody has voiced any opinion on the issue of standing, and if that would be a good way to resolve this case for now, since there are only eight justices on the Court?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to the whole argument today, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how this issue came up in the argument today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It looks like Kennedy is a little iffy on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s hard to tell just based solely on the questioning. \xc2\xa0There are a lot of assumptions made about the views of the justices, of the Affordable Care Act, based solely on how they questioned the Solicitor General at the time. \xc2\xa0That proved to be a rather unreliable measure of the -- or unreliable predictor of the eventual outcome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But if they were to throw it out on standing, that would be a major victory for the administration, would it not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m no attorney, but my understanding is, based on the public reporting on this, that, yes, if this is an argument that is thrown out on standing, then it would allow the administration to move forward with implementing this executive action. \xc2\xa0And we would obviously welcome the ability to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Iraq and the deployments there -- 200 additional soldiers doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a huge amount in the grand scheme of things, but now the number is back over -- the authorized level is back over 4,000.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And plus, some of these special operators are going to be going to the battalion level, which Secretary Carter acknowledged puts them closer to actual combat. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this a classic case of mission-creep?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mark, this is a classic case of the President asking his team to develop ways to intensify those elements of our strategy that have shown some progress. \xc2\xa0And we know that Iraqi forces fighting ISIL on the ground, in Iraq, have benefitted tremendously from the advice and assistance that they have received from U.S. servicemembers that have accompanied them. \xc2\xa0And what we have sought to do is to develop a strategy that would allow us to offer more advice and to offer greater assistance. \xc2\xa0That does not, however, put American servicemembers automatically on the front lines.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'m not seeking to downplay the significant risk that our servicemembers are taking in Iraq. \xc2\xa0We\'ve already seen a couple of U.S. servicemembers killed in Iraq. \xc2\xa0What they\'re doing is quite dangerous. \xc2\xa0That certainly applies to the fighter pilots that have been flying missions over Iraq and in Syria for well over a year now. \xc2\xa0These are men and women in our military who are putting themselves in harm\'s way for our national security. \xc2\xa0We owe them a debt of gratitude. \xc2\xa0But that is different than the kind of ground combat mission that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers had when President Bush sent them into Iraq. \xc2\xa0The mission that they have now is quite different.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But even if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t 100,000 men, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it further Americanize a fight that the President himself has said most effectively is fought by local forces on the ground?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is exactly right. \xc2\xa0This has to be a fight that is led by local forces. \xc2\xa0And the decisions that were announced today were announced after Secretary Carter had an opportunity to consult with Iraqi government officials, because Iraqi government officials are going to continue to call the shots here. \xc2\xa0And they obviously benefit tremendously from the support that they have received from the United States and our coalition partners. \xc2\xa0That support comes in a variety of forms. \xc2\xa0And what was announced today were ideas for intensifying that support in a rather tangible way. \xc2\xa0But it does not change the basic elements of the strategy, which is that this has to be a fight that is led by local forces with the support and assistance of the United States and our coalition partners. \xc2\xa0And that\'s exactly what we\'ve done thus far, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed based on the enhancements that were announced today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAngela.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Can you bring me up to speed on the state of play on breaking the logjam on Eric Fanning\'s nomination to be Army Secretary? \xc2\xa0As I\'m sure you know, Senator Roberts has a hold on that nomination, looking for a promise that the administration pledges to not send any Guantanamo Bay detainees to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a significant -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a procedural update to offer from here. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there is no questioning Mr. Fanning\'s commitment to serving this country. \xc2\xa0He is someone of unquestioned integrity and expertise when it comes to the critical functions of the United States Army. \xc2\xa0And he is a nominee who deserves bipartisan confirmation by the United States Senate, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been held up for too long. \xc2\xa0And it\'s unfortunate that his nomination and his career in service to this country has been ensnared in political arguments made by one particular senator.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the administration plan to offer a promise, a pledge to Senator Roberts on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\'ve been quite clear about our commitment to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and seeking the cooperation with the United States Senate -- even if they\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to help in that effort, the least they can do is remove the unwarranted obstructions that they have erected that have prevented the closing of the prison. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is hard to imagine that Senator Roberts takes this particularly seriously. \xc2\xa0You may recall the last time that anybody has talked about Senator Roberts was when he filmed a video of himself crumbling up the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and throwing it in a wastebasket. \xc2\xa0So maybe he relishes the opportunity to be before the camera, but it\'s not apparent that he takes this critically important national security issue all that seriously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One follow-up also on the call with Putin. \xc2\xa0Was that call initiated by the U.S. or by Russia?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know who initiated the phone call today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know the length of time that call lasted?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, but we\'ll look into it for you. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have all the details.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tByron.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Can you be more specific about the White House position on Saudi threats to sell off U.S. assets if the 9/11 bill passes? \xc2\xa0You say you don\'t think Saudi Arabia will follow through with this threat, or that the President will veto this bill so we wouldn\'t actually see this come to a head. \xc2\xa0Is the White House concerned about it? \xc2\xa0How do we interpret your answer earlier?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Byron, I tried to be as clear as I could be. \xc2\xa0I outlined the significant concerns that the United States has and the administration has with the idea of rolling back this key principle of international law. \xc2\xa0This question of sovereign immunity is something that protects the ability of the United States to work closely with countries all around the world. \xc2\xa0And walking back that principle would put the United States, our taxpayers and our servicemembers and diplomats at risk. \xc2\xa0And putting them into legal jeopardy is not a good idea and something that the President strongly opposes. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why he wouldn\'t sign legislation that would do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to this discussion about the selling of U.S. treasuries, obviously a country with a modern and large economy like Saudi Arabia would not benefit from a destabilized global financial market. \xc2\xa0And neither would the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would this also impact -- would such action have a significant impact on the U.S. economy? \xc2\xa0Is that something the White House is worried about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I\'m pointing out is that the Saudi government recognizes that both our countries and our economies benefit from the smooth functioning of the global financial system and it\'s not in their interest to destabilize it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Go ahead, Connie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the status of the memorandum of understanding? \xc2\xa0And does the President have any plan to go to Israel or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have an update for you on those discussions. \xc2\xa0I can certainly check with my National Security Council colleagues to see if they can provide you with an update. At this point, I don\'t have any new international travel to announce, but if the President decides to go to Israel I\'m sure all of you will have the opportunity to travel with him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How is he getting along with Netanyahu?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I mentioned I guess a number of times over the years, the best way to evaluate the relationship between our two countries is not based on the pleasantries that are exchanged in private discussions, but rather on the commitment of the leaders of two countries to, working together and cooperating, to advance the interests of their respective countries. \xc2\xa0And obviously, President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have been able to work effectively to demonstrate the U.S. rock-solid commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s national security. \xc2\xa0In fact, it was Prime Minister Netanyahu, himself, who indicated that the security cooperation between Israel and the United States under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership was unprecedented. \xc2\xa0And that\'s an ongoing commitment that President Obama has made throughout his seven years in office. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRich.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0To return to the Saudi-9/11 issue, in a conversation today that David Axelrod and Ben Rhodes had on CNN, Ben Rhodes said that there were people in the government doing their thing -- Saudi government -- where there was insufficient attention to where all this money was going over many years from the government apparatus. \xc2\xa0If that is the case, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t then there be some holding of responsibility by someone in the Saudi government? \xc2\xa0And doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that underscore those who support this bill and their argument?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Rich, let me start out by saying that Mr. Rhodes is currently the Deputy National Security Advisor, but earlier in his career he worked closely with Lee Hamilton, former Congressman from Indiana, who was the author of the report. \xc2\xa0And Ben had worked closely with Congressman Hamilton to write that report, so he\xe2\x80\x99s got his own detailed knowledge of this particular situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, that report concluded that they were not able to find any evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or that senior Saudi government officials were knowingly supportive of the 9/11 plotters. \xc2\xa0That\'s something that\'s included in the report. \xc2\xa0That\'s a report that\'s been declassified and made available to the public --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention those beneath that, and that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at the whole conversation, but I think what he\xe2\x80\x99s referring to is something that is included in the 9/11 Commission Report.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMore generally, I just want to go back to the fact that our concerns with the way the law is currently written stems from our view that protecting sovereign immunity is more important for the United States than it is for any other country. \xc2\xa0And walking back from the core international legal principle could have a significant and negative impact on our ability to do business around the world. \xc2\xa0Even worse, it could put U.S. servicemembers and diplomats into legal jeopardy in other countries\xe2\x80\x99 courts. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s not going to advance our interests. \xc2\xa0That\'s not going to make us safer. \xc2\xa0It would only make it harder for us to effectively engage and coordinate and cooperate with countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, who has been helpful in our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, to go after al Qaida elements in Yemen, and to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s malign activities throughout the Middle East. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this particular principle that we\'re discussing is not just about our relationship with one country, it\'s about the United States\xe2\x80\x99 relationship and our ability to work with countries all around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So ruling out the court system as a venue, what recourse do the 9/11 families have if there\xe2\x80\x99s an acknowledgement that there perhaps are some within a foreign government who may be responsible?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Rich, what I can tell you is that the administration has worked aggressively to support the 9/11 families seeking compensation, and we have worked hard to support, and offered our full-throated support, to the rescue workers who risked their lives to rescue innocent Americans and to rebuild at Ground Zero. \xc2\xa0That\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s record when it comes to 9/11 and in supporting those who lost loved ones on 9/11.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe legacy of that event is that President Obama has also sought to make protecting the American people his number-one priority. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s worked with our allies and partners around the globe to counter terrorism, to advance our national security, and to advance our interests. \xc2\xa0And the truth is, countries like Saudi Arabia -=- a country like Saudi Arabia is a good example. \xc2\xa0We certainly do not agree with everything that Saudi Arabia does, and there are numerous differences between our two countries. \xc2\xa0But the fact remains that the United States and Saudi Arabia are able to coordinate effectively to counter terrorism, to combat extremists, to degrade and destroy ISIL, and to advance the security interests of both of our countries. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s why this kind of cooperation is critically important. \xc2\xa0It\'s why the President hosted Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries at Camp David last spring. \xc2\xa0And it\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling to Saudi Arabia this week to meet with the leaders of GCC countries to talk about deepening our cooperation and ensuring that as they work together to provide for their own security that the United States can continue to facilitate improved cooperation among them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President conducted any personal outreach on this bill? \xc2\xa0Congressional outreach?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any presidential-level conversations about this particular piece of legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one more question on the $750 billion. \xc2\xa0Is it safe to say that you would -- given what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said on this briefing, that given the concerns that the Saudis might have, what it would do to the world economy and their own economy if they were to unload $750 billion of U.S. assets, that it\'s essentially a bluff?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\'m just -- the principle that I\'ve repeatedly stated I\'ll state one more time, which is the United States certainly believes that Saudi Arabia understands our shared interest in protecting the stability and security of the international financial system. \xc2\xa0Saudi Arabia is a large economy and they would not benefit from roiling global financial markets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0A budget question. \xc2\xa0Last Friday, you indicated that the Overseas Contingency Fund shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used as sort of a slush fund. \xc2\xa0But Republicans are looking for more defense spending. \xc2\xa0You\'re looking, and Democrats are looking for Zika funding, for water funding, those type of things. \xc2\xa0Is there a deal to be had to increase spending as long as it\'s both defense and nondefense? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Cheryl, when it comes to protecting the basic public health and well-being of the American people, that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the subject of wheeling and dealing. \xc2\xa0It should be the subject of members of the United States Congress, particularly Republicans, setting aside politics and doing their job. \xc2\xa0And in this case, the administration, after consulting with our foremost scientists and public health experts, put together a funding proposal and sent it to Congress two months ago. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCongress has not acted on that funding proposal, and instead, our public health professionals have been forced to pull money from other critical functions in order to try to begin the work of preparing for the Zika virus, when the truth is that if Congress had acted as the way you would expect them to, that money would have already been provided and our public health professionals would be farther along in their work to protect the country from the Zika virus, and our state and local partners around the country who will be at the front lines of this would be better prepared to, for example, eradicate mosquito populations, or to target mosquito populations to prevent an outbreak.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also would see enhanced lab capacity so that people who are seeking to get a Zika test would be able to get the test in the first place, but would also be able to get a prompt response from the lab after they had undergone the test. \xc2\xa0Neither of those is true right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is more that we need Congress to do, and there\'s no reason it should be subject to a negotiation. \xc2\xa0This is part of the basic responsibility of the United States Congress, which is to take responsible steps, separate from politics, to protect the public health and well-being of the American people. \xc2\xa0That\'s what they should do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFred.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was release out today that the FBI, the Association of National Police Chiefs and other law enforcement groups are supporting the Burr-Feinstein legislation on encryption. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that it\'s reported that the White House is very undecided about it at least. \xc2\xa0Is there any rethinking on that as to whether the President would sign it if it does come to his desk?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Fred, I have to admit, when you started that question I thought you were going to talk about the extensive law enforcement support for the President\'s executive actions on immigration. \xc2\xa0A similar group of law enforcement officials have come out and expressed their strong support for the President\'s immigration executive action. \xc2\xa0And despite what the Attorney General of Texas might tell you, the fact is the top law enforcement officials in the state of Texas actually think that what the President wants to do when it comes to our immigration system would actually make communities in Texas safer. \xc2\xa0But that\'s just one example, and that\'s one tangent that\'s on my mind based on the way that you asked your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, yes, as it relates to encryption, I\'m not aware that we\'ve taken a specific position on the legislation that you referred to. \xc2\xa0Obviously administration officials have been in touch with members who Congress who are interested in this issue. \xc2\xa0There is expertise that law enforcement and technological experts in the U.S. government can offer as this kind of policy is being carefully considered. \xc2\xa0The administration has engaged in those conversations in good faith.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I continue to harbor is deep skepticism that Congress will succeed in writing and passing legislation that would effectively address this complicated policy issue. \xc2\xa0In some ways, the context of your question is relevant because, when it comes to something like Zika, that should probably be among the easiest things that Congress should have to do to make a decision about making sure that our public health professionals have the money that they need to protect the American people from a virus. \xc2\xa0That\'s a pretty straightforward thing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to encryption, that\'s much more complicated. \xc2\xa0We\'re talking about a technology that\'s rapidly changing and questions about deeply held principles related to both national security and privacy. \xc2\xa0I just happen to be personally skeptical that Congress would succeed in getting something useful done on that when even the simple things, like protecting the American people from Zika, Congress seems unable to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So your skepticism is not to the substance of the Burr-Feinstein bill, but it\'s whether Congress could actually get this done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think a congressional process that yield a piece of legislation that is both effective in addressing the problem and capable of passing both Republican-led bodies in Congress -- yes, I\'m quite skeptical that that will happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I have a question on -- last week, the House Freedom Caucus called again for impeachment of the IRS Commissioner. \xc2\xa0The House Oversight Committee had initially put this idea forward. \xc2\xa0First, is there a White House response to that? \xc2\xa0And secondly, does the President have full confidence in the IRS Commissioner?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Of course, he does. \xc2\xa0It is ridiculous for Republicans in Congress, who seek to gut funding for the IRS -- in some cases, they actually call for the outright abolition of the agency -- to be a fair arbiter of the effectiveness of the IRS Commissioner. \xc2\xa0The fact is, Mr. Koskinen has an extraordinarily difficult job, and it\'s made only more difficult because Republicans seek to try to cut the funding of his agency. \xc2\xa0He is somebody who undertakes that work with a lot of professionalism and seriousness of purpose, and he deserves our gratitude for his good work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDave.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, there was a GAO report out today that said the VA is still having significant problems fixing -- that veterans are still waiting long periods of time to get appointments in the health care system and that the Department has not solved the problem. \xc2\xa0Is the President frustrated at the pace of this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is no denying that the problems that the VA has encountered for more than a decade now have been deeply entrenched. \xc2\xa0And there are critically important reforms that are having a positive impact and we have made important progress in ensuring that our veterans get the benefits that they have so richly earned. \xc2\xa0That said, there\'s more work that needs to be done to implement those reforms and to continue to accelerate the progress of those reforms. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that VA Secretary McDonald is intensely focused on. \xc2\xa0He does that work with the strong support of the President, because President Obama has made this a priority, and we\'re committed to making sure that we serve our veterans well. \xc2\xa0And there\'s more work that needs to be done to make sure that we realize that goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The administration only has a few months left to tackle this problem. \xc2\xa0How confident is the White House that you\'re going to resolve it by the time you leave office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that there\'s no denying that in the first seven years of the Obama administration, that we have made remarkable progress in improving the service delivery system and drastically reducing the backlog and benefits claims. \xc2\xa0So that progress has been important. \xc2\xa0But there\'s nobody right now that\'s satisfied. \xc2\xa0We know that there\'s a lot more important work to be done. \xc2\xa0And when you\'re talking about making sure that the bravest Americans have gotten their due, have gotten what they were promised, that\'s an important priority. \xc2\xa0It\'s certainly one that this President takes very seriously, and he certainly is not going to be satisfied until all that work has gotten done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJohn, I\'ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President obviously also has a lot of confidence in the Solicitor General who argued the case on behalf of the administration today. \xc2\xa0Did the President consult with Mr. Verrilli over the arguments that he was going to put forward before the Supreme Court today? \xc2\xa0And on the back end, did he get a debriefing from Mr. Verrilli about how things went today at the Supreme Court?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much conversation that they had prior to the arguments. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the President will get a briefing from his staff before the end of the day today on how the arguments went. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Mr. Verrilli will offer that briefing in person, but it will be an opportunity for the President to hear how the case went.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, Mr. Verrilli is someone who has been through the wringer here several times and, I think by any assessment, is somebody that has a sterling track record, particularly on the most important cases in representing the federal government before the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President\'s confidence in Solicitor General Verrilli is quite well earned, and that confidence in Mr. Verrilli and his abilities has paid off -- not just for the President, but for the American people who have enjoyed significant benefits from the Affordable Care Act, for example, as a result of Mr. Verrilli\'s effective advocacy before the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see you tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:57 P.M.
