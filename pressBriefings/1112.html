CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Pretty full house. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are you smiling?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s an absolutely gorgeous day outside for the first time in a while.\xc2\xa0 And if only -- if only -- we should have done this outside.\xc2\xa0 It would have been great.\xc2\xa0 We will do that one day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or at Camp David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you move the deficit talks out there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Boy, that would be good, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make at the top of briefing, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go straight to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Erica.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about whether you\xe2\x80\x99re now considering the McConnell plan in combination with spending cuts, and might that be a better way to appeal to some Republicans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying -- reminding you what I said yesterday about Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, which is we appreciate the fact that implicit -- explicit within it is the acknowledgment that we here in Washington -- the leaders of Congress, the President of the United States -- have no alternative but to ensure that the United States of America upholds the full faith and credit of the country, that we will not default on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 So no matter what happens, that has to be the case.\xc2\xa0 The proposal that Senator McConnell put forward acknowledges that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the preferred option that we have.\xc2\xa0 The President remains committed to working towards a bipartisan compromise agreement that significantly reduces the deficit and the long-term debt, addresses some of these major issues that have been before us in Washington for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s provision or some variation of it, they are not the preferred outcome here, and we continue to work, as we did yesterday in the meeting and as the President will again today in his meeting with congressional leaders, towards something more substantial and significant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is an important recognition of the fact that the United States will not, for the first time in its history, default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, given where things stand, is it looking like a better option today than it did yesterday, especially potentially combined with spending cuts that could bring rank-and-file Republicans onboard?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize that beyond saying that it remains not the preferred option, because I think -- what\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, despite everything, is that progress has been made.\xc2\xa0 Significant details and proposals have been discussed and put on the table in these negotiations that involve real and substantial reductions in our spending and cuts in the deficit.\xc2\xa0 The President wants that to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is now a foundation upon which we can build to get something even bigger, and in fact something very significant, the so-called grand bargain, if everyone at the table is willing to take the plunge, essentially, and to lead, and to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen and if the Republicans move off of their insistence for a one-to-one match between deficit reduction and debt-ceiling increase, would the President in that case move off of his insistence on revenue as part of the deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of hypotheticals, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to draw lines in the sand with regard to things the President may or may not do that may or may not come to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President insists that a substantial agreement that involves substantial deficit reduction has to include all the things that drive our deficits and debt, and that has a balanced approach that includes cuts in entitlement spending as well as cuts in discretionary spending as well as cuts in defense spending as well as cuts in tax code spending. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what also is true is that -- I mean, the starting point here that\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember is that this President starts from the premise that he shares the concern that a lot of people have about the need to get the deficits under control -- our deficits under control.\xc2\xa0 He shares the concern about our long-term debt.\xc2\xa0 He is committed to reducing spending.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He believes that we have now in front of us the potential to do something big.\xc2\xa0 The Holy Grail, if you will, of the sort of good government think tank types and responsible leaders of both parties in this town for a long time has been:\xc2\xa0 When will the leaders in Washington come together to do something significant, in a comprehensive way, that addresses our deficits and our long-term debt?\xc2\xa0 That agreement is right here within reach; it\xe2\x80\x99s on the table.\xc2\xa0 We just have to reach for it and grasp it, and be willing to compromise to do it.\xc2\xa0 And you know what?\xc2\xa0 That requires thinking about the broad American public, and not the narrow bands or the narrow constituencies within your own party.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then do you rule out something that\xe2\x80\x99s smaller scale and does not include revenue, or do you not rule that out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to rule anything out, except to say what the President has said in the past -- is that he will not sign -- he will not turn this into a tollbooth situation because we are not a third-world country that approaches the brink of default every three or four months.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling anything out. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has there been any consideration of moving the talks to Camp David for this weekend?\xc2\xa0 And related to that, is there a sense that the current format or the current structure needs some shaking up?\xc2\xa0 The last few days don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have yielded progress, and if anything the acrimony has increased.\xc2\xa0 Is there consideration to changing the format?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m personally partial to Mark Knoller\xe2\x80\x99s idea of letting them in there to tweet it out, but you guys may feel differently.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To tweet it out -- is that what you said?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Because you think the public posturing and that kind of stuff is really where we ought to go to get something done? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Transparency and openness is how I\xe2\x80\x99d put it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me address your first question, which is that the -- every meeting we\xe2\x80\x99ve had so far in this round of negotiations led by the President has occurred in the White House; every meeting we have planned, today and in the coming days, is planned for the White House.\xc2\xa0 And the possibility that you mentioned is not currently planned, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- so that\xe2\x80\x99s all I have to say about that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the structure of the meetings, look, these are the leaders of Congress, and this is the President and the Vice President and the Secretary of the Treasury and Director of OMB, et cetera, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 These are the people who have to, in the end, come to an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And whatever table they sit around in whatever room, it\xe2\x80\x99s still the same people who have to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the fact that we have these negotiations and discussions here in the White House in the Cabinet Room does not preclude, obviously, additional conversations between -- among lawmakers or smaller groups, or other interactions that help move things forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of -- look, I think -- nobody said this was going to be easy.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the progress that has been made, I go back to what I was just saying -- progress has been made.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that not every member in there -- in fact, the majority of the folks in there from Congress were not participants in the conversations led by the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 They were not participants, except for the two men themselves in the conversations between the Speaker of the House and the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And so there was a lot of significant detail that everybody needed to be brought up to speed on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are now in a situation where our side, the White House, has made clear in a presentation yesterday that there are significant cuts -- $1.5 trillion in cuts that everybody can agree on, real and significant; an additional $200 billion in cuts that essentially we believe everybody can agree on.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s $1.7 trillion, significant in and of itself.\xc2\xa0 The President wants more.\xc2\xa0 You know why?\xc2\xa0 Because that significant agreement is right there on the table to be achieved if people are willing to lead and to compromise and not posture and not cater to segments of their own constituency.\xc2\xa0 So we want to build on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, they will discuss significant issues in terms of savings that could be found -- reasonable savings that can be found in the health care entitlement programs; significant savings that can be found through the tax code.\xc2\xa0 And all it requires is for leaders of both parties, as well as the President, to decide that achieving something significant here is a worthy goal, and that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to get outside their comfort zone, they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take the heat that will inevitably come when leaders lead and make significant choices, because inevitably not everybody in your party, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a Democrat or Republican, is going to be happy with the choices you make.\xc2\xa0 But the goal here is worth taking that risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moody\xe2\x80\x99s and S&amp;P having weighed in recently, do you think the participants are feeling the added pressure?\xc2\xa0 Are we in this kind of red zone where the markets could really get spooked?\xc2\xa0 I know that everybody is focused on August 2nd, but are you equally worried that in the run-up to that, that investors may see that this is not really yielding the kind of progress that they would hope to see and they could get spooked?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said I think for a long time now that it is important not to push this to the absolute last minute -- although that is what Congress tends to do -- precisely for the reasons that you mention.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, we are -- have been and continue to be heartened by the fact that leaders of both parties in Congress are saying what we are saying, which is that it is inconceivable and it will not happen that the United States will default for the first time in its history. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s important to send out that reassurance that the people in the room all agree on that fundamental principle.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that is an important thing to remember even as we get closer and closer to the deadline.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, the clock is ticking.\xc2\xa0 We need to get further down the road here.\xc2\xa0 We need to get to the point where we know whether or not we can achieve a significant compromise, bipartisan compromise, on deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And if not, then we have to make sure we do the bare minimum, which is not default on our obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The worst-case scenario here is a default, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is a bad scenario.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- there are things you could anticipate, but I -- yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it worse than voting on the debt ceiling again next year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The uncertainty created by regular votes on whether or not for the first -- and if you think the political obstacles --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Weren\xe2\x80\x99t there regular votes every year in the Bush years, pretty much every year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but it had not become -- look, boy, there were.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s funny that you should mention it, because --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were, every year, and all these guys voted for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- collectively, the Republican negotiators in this room with the President have voted to raise the debt limit 25 times.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker of the House has voted six times.\xc2\xa0 The Majority Leader of the House has voted to raise the debt limit five times in his career in the House.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell has voted to raise the debt limit eight times; Senator Kyl six times. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Obama voted against it one time. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And he has made very clear that he now views that as a mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My point is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over what period is that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Since 1990.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand this ultimatum that the President brought into the room with him that this needs to extend into 2013. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because the kind of atmosphere that\xe2\x80\x99s created now that has brought us to the brink of doing something that has never been done before is unlikely to improve in an election year, and we are not, as I said before, the kind of country that wants to or should put in doubt in the global economic market, or raise the question on a regular basis whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re going to default on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as Caren just mentioned, we have rating agencies putting us on warning.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is not good for our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if we do this regularly you can bet that it will have a negative impact on our economic prospects, on our growth and our job creation because it creates uncertainty about the economic environment that businesses are operating in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re comparing it to extending the debt ceiling to 2013.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m comparing it to defaulting.\xc2\xa0 Which is worse?\xc2\xa0 Because the President is saying essentially he would rather have it default than have to vote on this again next year.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is saying that leaders should lead and we have to do the right thing here.\xc2\xa0 You can, as a piece of political analysis, have an opinion about it.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is this is not what the United States should do.\xc2\xa0 And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe we will do it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m analyzing your own -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s your own statements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and we think -- we think we can get to an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s significant.\xc2\xa0 And remember, this is all because of an arbitrary connection that was established between the amount by which Congress would have to raise the debt ceiling and the amount by which we should --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Granted, and if Steel or Buck were in front of me, I\xe2\x80\x99d be asking them that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I mean, a completely unrelated, arbitrary political and, essentially, meaningless connection between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s ultimatum, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask them about that later.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So -- but, Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question.\xc2\xa0 We do not think that that is the way that this country should operate -- the President has made very clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What the President made clear in the meeting was that he will not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Both are bad; I can\xe2\x80\x99t choose which is worse for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 Default might not be as bad as voting on this next year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you guys are painting a very cataclysmic picture -- that I\xe2\x80\x99m not challenging -- on how bad a default would be.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why that is preferable --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to default, Jake.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to default.\xc2\xa0 I think I -- in the answer to two previous questions, before I got to you, made clear that no one in the room thinks we\xe2\x80\x99re going to default, and the President and the Vice President don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to default.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical that we don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to entertain.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that it would be easier to reach a deal without House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the room?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have to reach a deal with the leaders of Congress of both parties, and everyone has to participate and be engaged in that process.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s important is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s that everyone decides to play the role of the leader and to think, again, not just about the constituents in his or her district or state, and not just the constituents who are the most vocal in his or her party, but about the whole country and what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the whole country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the opportunity here -- again, this is a prize, this is a prize that has been sought for a long time and it is an objective that Republicans in particular have made clear is very important -- significant deficit reduction, getting our debt -- long-term debt under control, getting our spending under control.\xc2\xa0 Well, here it is.\xc2\xa0 The President is ready to make that deal; he is ready to compromise; he is ready to make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that Cantor has complicated the process in any way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated process.\xc2\xa0 What has to happen is that the leaders of both parties in both houses have to be willing to do the right thing for the country -- not the party, not a narrow band of constituents, but for the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the White House view Friday, if that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of the ultimate date to reach some kind of agreement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, we\xe2\x80\x99ve never said that.\xc2\xa0 The President views Friday as an important moment where we can make an assessment about whether we are moving toward a significant bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it is not a day -- and if we are moving in that direction -- and he sincerely hopes we are -- then we will continue towards that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re not then we have to begin looking at making sure that we fulfill our obligation to uphold the credit rating of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how many options are out there that the White House is currently reviewing if there\xe2\x80\x99s no significant progress on Friday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a number of options that they\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s more -- it\xe2\x80\x99s several options?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, look, various people I\xe2\x80\x99m sure are working on various options.\xc2\xa0 We are focused at the White House on the opportunity here that has presented itself, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come every day, which is to achieve a significant bipartisan agreement that reduces spending, cuts the deficit, and does it in a balanced way that will help our economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office says that -- obviously revenues is on the agenda today, but they say what\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda is net-neutral revenues, which I take to mean that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that an Internet thing?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not, actually.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re borrowing the expression.\xc2\xa0 But net-neutral revenues, meaning it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do anything to deficits or debts, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be neutral.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s understanding?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we will discuss today, as I said, is some of these difficult issues that could help us reach a significant package if people are willing to compromise, and that includes getting savings out of health care entitlements in a reasonable way that protects beneficiaries, that strengthens the programs involved, and ways that we can find savings in our tax code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, there are a variety of different ways to skin this cat, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure people will come to the table with positions about what they believe is the right thing to do, and obviously we will, too, and then from that point negotiations hopefully will ensue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the briefing last night there were some who felt that -- in the White House who felt there could actually be the kind of breakthrough today that would put this thing on a path to the big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let it be so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What reason do you have to be that optimistic, given how contentious things were yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that optimism, while admirable, is wholly rooted in reality.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I would predict to you -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m an optimist -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach an agreement today, a grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 What I will predict to you is -- what I will say to you is that, contrary to assessments that assume no significant achievement is possible here, there is a potential here for a significant achievement; there is potential here of savings in the $1.7 trillion and up, which while not the grand bargain that is still possible is significant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we want to build on that.\xc2\xa0 And the President, if he finds partners willing to compromise, willing to make the right choices here on behalf of the American people, we can do something even bigger and more significant.\xc2\xa0 So -- but I do not expect today a hallelujah moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, tomorrow -- when you say that\xe2\x80\x99s the day when the President wants to determine whether they can continue to move toward a significant deal -- are you saying the $4 trillion deal would be taken off the table, or both?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- no, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of size.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s whether or not we can reach a significant bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And I think \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d means where everybody agrees.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And even the stuff that I talked about -- and let me go back, when I talked about what is already on the table that the sides agreed to -- this is in principle, because nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 And there are components here that different sides feel differently about that are dependent on agreement in other areas.\xc2\xa0 So without characterizing what \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d looks like in terms of numbers, I think we will know tomorrow -- the President wants everyone to be able to make an assessment, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re moving down the road towards something along those lines or not, and then we can decide what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s only the 14th.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take things off the table tomorrow if --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to if we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And as I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear up to this point is we believe, in spite of everything, that we have made progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I hate to beat this dead horse, but you guys did go through some of this last night, but now that you\xe2\x80\x99re on camera -- of the things that Eric Cantor alleged happened at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, what did happen and what didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you have to ask me a more specific question.\xc2\xa0 But I think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President say, \xe2\x80\x9cEric, don\xe2\x80\x99t call my bluff.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m taking this to the American people\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a word-for-word account to give you, but the President, as the meeting was wrapping up, expressed his feelings that the folks in that room need to lead, all of us -- all of them together need to lead, and that this is a moment when it\xe2\x80\x99s important to reach for a goal that works for the whole country, that is supported by the vast majority of the American people, which is a balanced agreement that does something significant on deficits, does something on our long-term debt, begins to get our fiscal house in order, and not resort to the kind of stuff that people hate about Washington -- the sort of posturing and catering and positioning that don\xe2\x80\x99t lead us down the road towards significant accomplishments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It requires a willingness to move outside of your comfort zone to do something like this.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what he called on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President storm out of the room?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He did not.\xc2\xa0 It is preposterous to suggest so.\xc2\xa0 The meeting was wrapping up; he expressed his very strongly held opinion about what we need to do here, and that was the end of the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President invoke Ronald Reagan to say he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit here like this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair to say, as any student of history can tell you, that Ronald Reagan successfully reached agreements with the Democratic Speaker of the House that involved balance and involved, in this case, a willingness to accept revenues as part of a package to achieve longer-term solvency, for example, in Social Security or tax reform or things like that -- that Ronald Reagan, who is admired widely by many Americans, but in particular Republicans, who admire him as somebody who was serious about cutting spending and reducing taxes and getting control of deficits, was willing to work with the Democratic Speaker of the House and accept that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get everything he wanted, and in fact recognized that if he insisted on his maximalist position he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get anything at all. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So President Reagan was a realist in that sense and he understood that victory can be shared, that accomplishments in this town require Democrats and Republicans working together.\xc2\xa0 President Obama shares that opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I need to switch gears for a second.\xc2\xa0 Judicial Watch, the watchdog group, has obtained some emails from the administration about an October 2009 incident about whether or not FOX News would get an interview with Ken Feinberg, then the executive pay czar.\xc2\xa0 And publicly, the administration was saying that FOX was not excluded.\xc2\xa0 The emails seemed to suggest that FOX was perhaps punished and was excluded.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration concluded there was any inappropriate activity there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, first of all, let me address a serious matter here, that I can say, having looked into this matter, that no one at the White House, either a current or former employee, ever placed a dead fish in the FOX News cubbyhole, which I know is a suggestion.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I can also say that it is well known that at the time there was a dispute between FOX News and its coverage and the White House and its feelings about the coverage.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that was then, and we obviously deal with FOX News regularly.\xc2\xa0 I call on you regularly.\xc2\xa0 We give interviews to FOX News, including to Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know much about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a matter of policy, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a pool event, should it be open to all networks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a matter of policy?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to look at -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t read that part of the policy manual.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t a pooled event when one network pools for the rest?\xc2\xa0 I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m getting caught in a trick question.\xc2\xa0 And since I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here for that part of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to examine that, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if you were going to arrange for a pooled interview with a senior administration official, would you assume that all the standard networks would be included?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look at what the policy standards are.\xc2\xa0 But my point, Mike, is that we regularly engage with every network and every news organization here, including FOX, and give interviews to FOX, and respect the reporters at FOX who are reporters and do their job.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you say it\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical and there will not be a default, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask again today even though I know we plow this ground every day but we\xe2\x80\x99re one day closer.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration begun to prioritize how it will handle a default on August 3rd?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to address that question to the Treasury Department, which does the analysis on what happens in a default.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it would be the responsible thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not arguing with that.\xc2\xa0 I think that where we get hung up was this assertion that there\xe2\x80\x99s a plan B that somehow allows us to get around default.\xc2\xa0 No such thing exists.\xc2\xa0 If there were --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a hypothetical, as you said, if there is actually planning to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It would be irresponsible not to, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware in any specificity of what planning is going on.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that -- it just stands to reason that, again, if you have a dollar in bills and you only have 60 cents in your pocket, you got to borrow the other 40 cents, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve just been cut off from borrowing, that you got to figure out what to do.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, how that process works, I think Treasury, OMB is where I would direct you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of curious about the politics of this and how something is going to pass eventually, assuming that something does pass.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a hard-core -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s the right word -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a group of Republicans in the House who will not vote in any way, shape or form to raise the debt ceiling no matter what any prospective deal looks like.\xc2\xa0 Inside these rooms, are these people taking into consideration, or are they largely taking themselves out of consideration by adopting that position?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in the room we have leaders of both houses of Congress, including of the House of Representatives, where I think some of the folks that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about reside.\xc2\xa0 The leaders in that room take that into account.\xc2\xa0 They know that the need for the United States to pay its bills and fulfill its obligations is a national priority.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a Democratic priority or a Republican priority.\xc2\xa0 And it is in fact -- I mean, I think that when you talk about those members who seem to think that there is little consequence to the prospect of defaulting, despite all the significant evidence to the contrary, that they need to think twice about what goals are they looking to achieve here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because, remember, raising the debt ceiling is simply a mechanism by which Congress is allowed to borrow the money to pay the bills that it ran up already.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about new spending here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about spending that was run up -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about national debt -- spending that was run up disproportionately prior to this administration coming into office. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a shared responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And I am confident that it will be viewed that way, and is viewed that way, by the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see any value in getting out of the confines of this building into a place like Camp David to have the conversations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I personally do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get out more often.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- does the administration as a whole see a value in getting --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do the people in the White House who are running these deficit talks see a value in it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the meetings have been held in the White House so I think we feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice building with some nice rooms and comfortable chairs and a table and it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly suitable place to have the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me in theory would it also be that could these meetings be held in other places?\xc2\xa0 I suppose in theory they could be. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking in theory --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- but if we felt like they should be I think we\xe2\x80\x99d be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is what -- maybe I should put it this way -- what value does it bring to having a meeting in a different, alternate setting, where perhaps --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Who said we\xe2\x80\x99re having a meeting in an alternate setting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say you were.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, this sounds like a question you could ask like a management training seminar organizer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What value does it have -- we\xe2\x80\x99re holding the meetings here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see value -- and if so, what is it?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But based on what?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re having the meetings here.\xc2\xa0 I see value in having the meeting down the hall from my office and the President\xe2\x80\x99s office so that, as a matter of convenience -- that works for me.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Congress is just up the road here -- that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty convenient.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What other values besides convenience?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ask me a question that makes sense and I can answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean -- I apologize.\xc2\xa0 I apologize.\xc2\xa0 Ask me a question that relates to what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, are we going to another location -- we have no plans to do that.\xc2\xa0 In theory, could we or might that be a good idea?\xc2\xa0 I suppose so, but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Why do you suppose so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- well, because -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I like to move around and see new places and -- but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of your personal preferences, that\xe2\x80\x99s why it might be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 But, again, Laura, what are we talking about here?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure you know, and I know I sure don\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we all know, and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t decline to answer the question -- that\xe2\x80\x99s fine -- but I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I honestly am not trying to decline to answer the question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure what the question is.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering something.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xc2\xa0 The only meetings we have scheduled are here, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like an alternate universe question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of the interviews that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing with local TV stations --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A lot of folks get their news -- believe it or not -- from other places besides the news organizations represented here or represented by me when I worked for one for 20 years.\xc2\xa0 So we -- the President tries to -- we give interviews to CBS News and we give interviews to local reporters from a local network. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this part of the effort to take the case to the American people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this since he became President.\xc2\xa0 So if \xe2\x80\x9cthe case\xe2\x80\x9d means explaining what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing as President, yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, would you say the talks are becoming increasingly contentious and frustrating as each day goes forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Would I say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that the talks continue to be serious, they continue to be focused on substantive issues, and they are by and large engaged -- they by and large occur in an environment that\xe2\x80\x99s reasonably collegial and respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama feeling frustrated that he\xe2\x80\x99s not really getting the progress that he hoped rapidly enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not, and -- because, again, I think there is more progress than is necessarily perceived on the outside.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I understand that this is hard stuff and participants in the meeting come out and talk about the disagreements, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to remember that there are areas of agreement and there are areas of overlap where we can reduce spending and build upon that to do something even more significant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the -- to the extent the President feels any frustration, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply at the prospect that something real and tangible and significant, and in fact generational, in terms of an accomplishment, is there for the taking if everyone in that room would be willing to compromise, get outside his or her comfort zone, and reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not that far out of reach; it\xe2\x80\x99s really quite close.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a follow-up on Laura -- will you take a pool to Camp David with you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 When I go with my family to -- actually they won\xe2\x80\x99t let me do that.\xc2\xa0 But we have no plans to move offsite. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even though you have no plans, are you ruling it out, especially since Boehner has said that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling anything out.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, this is a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it without him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I read was a report by a news organization with two unnamed, unidentified, unlocated sources saying that something was being considered.\xc2\xa0 Well, I considered having the chicken tacos today -- (laughter) -- but instead I had the salmon.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- for lunch, it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had meetings here.\xc2\xa0 If those plans change, we will absolutely tell you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will bring a pool.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Boehner has said that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go; it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary to do it.\xc2\xa0 So could you do the talks without him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, nobody has invited him to go anywhere.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Except to come here, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s coming. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is July 22nd still -- can you explain where that falls?\xc2\xa0 That was originally your deadline.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- to get a deal -- would that mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I have explained a few times from here the July 22nd date was a loose date put -- a judgment made based on the need for Congress to do the things that it does to produce legislation working back from the August 2nd date.\xc2\xa0 So generally speaking, the clock is ticking and we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer and closer to August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 And there is a point before August 2nd after which it becomes really hard for Congress to move legislation through both houses.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- July 22nd is not some -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not similar to the August 2nd date, which is reached by careful analysis and numbers crunching and all that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 This is more an observation about how Congress works.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At one of these background briefings, though, we learned that 80 percent of a deal would have to be reached by July 22nd.\xc2\xa0 At least a big portion of a deal would have to be reached by that point.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I suppose.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think these are -- 80 percent is probably a loose figure.\xc2\xa0 July 22nd is a rough estimate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about already today the need for participants in these meetings to make an assessment tomorrow whether or not we are moving towards a significant bipartisan compromise on deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow, July 15th. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are milestones along the way here, because we only have so many days between now and August 2nd to decide whether we are going to press forward and achieve a significant deficit reduction deal or not.\xc2\xa0 Because what will happen regardless is we will -- Congress will raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 We will not default on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 We take the leaders at their words and believe them when they say that they understand the impact of default would be quite serious.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one final thing.\xc2\xa0 The EU is drawing up a second rescue package for Greece.\xc2\xa0 How often is the President getting briefed on the situation in Greece?\xc2\xa0 And how concerned is he about the impact globally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- beyond saying \xe2\x80\x9cregularly,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean, he is briefed on it and brought up to date on it, as you know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, our view of this has not changed, which is that Europe has within its capacity and the institutions like the IMF have within their capacity the ability to deal with this situation, and we think they will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he getting daily updates, then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he gets daily economic briefings both on paper and verbally.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he is updated as necessary on that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi?\xc2\xa0 Did you -- sorry, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t -- Scott, sorry.\xc2\xa0 No, you\xe2\x80\x99re good?\xc2\xa0 Jackie? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, just quickly, do you expect meetings this weekend like we\xe2\x80\x99ve had each day this week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hard to say.\xc2\xa0 I think that if we are moving towards an agreement that we can expect to continue working through the weekend.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule to announce. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since beyond that though, it would just be two weeks before August 2nd, what do you see -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the thinking here as to what the process would be that you would -- having made a decision tomorrow to fish or cut bait, you would work through the weekend, have something that could start being put into --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think regardless of the assessment that\xe2\x80\x99s made tomorrow about which direction we\xe2\x80\x99re going in, that people will continue to work through the weekend for precisely the reason that you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of time here with regards to the need to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Now, what form that work will take, I just -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t made determinations yet about meetings.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the folks with the calculators at the very least will be working through the weekend regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Moody\xe2\x80\x99s release yesterday, if the President were able to get a deal that had the agreed cuts in it, $1 trillion or $1.5 trillion, would that be sufficient to retain a stable outlook?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that would be, obviously, up to the rating agencies.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- what I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to engage in -- even though I wanted to make clear the substantive, significant, real, irrefutably consequential cuts that the White House has been -- made clear it is willing to accept, I am not at all willing to say we\xe2\x80\x99re -- we want to stop here or we\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied with this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not drawing any of those lines in the sand. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President wants to continue working towards the most significant package possible that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced and ensures that the sacrifice here is shared.\xc2\xa0 And how the ratings agencies will react to that, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s not part of the analysis that Secretary Geithner is doing in the meetings?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he sometimes speaks a language I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, is it accurate that -- do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s true that the President would wear the jacket if they -- if the group ended up deciding on some kind of exit -- McConnell-style exit strategy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the meaning intended here was that the President is willing to take responsibility for leading, and that he is willing to do what it takes to compromise to reach something significant, and that he is willing to own it if other people won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But we have to raise the debt ceiling, because the United States is the United States and it does not default on its obligations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the jacket you get to wear when you\xe2\x80\x99re the President of the United States, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll wear it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a bit here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday issued a statement on Mumbai terrorist attack, and he offered help to India in investigations.\xc2\xa0 Today, do you have any information on who was behind the attack?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Indian government is investigating that and we have offered to assist in any way we can.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information regarding who might be responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, Secretary Clinton is going to India next week for the second Strategic Dialogue with India.\xc2\xa0 Is she carrying any message from the President for the talks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 As regards the attacks, the same message that was expressed in the statement the President put forward yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But in the talks themselves, I would send you to the State Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just follow, Jay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President continues to push for the largest deal possible, and yet a lot of lawmakers have outwardly said they don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be possible.\xc2\xa0 Is it still realistic to think that a large deal is possible?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is realistic.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not being Pollyannaish and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, it will happen, it\xe2\x80\x99s guaranteed or it\xe2\x80\x99s an odds-on likelihood, but I think that the whole purpose of the meetings we\xe2\x80\x99ve had so far is to clear the decks, look at what has been discussed in previous negotiating rounds, where we have agreement, look at where we\xe2\x80\x99re close to agreement, come to agreement on that, and keep building.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the building process continues today as we look at some of the areas of disagreement on entitlement spending and on spending through the tax code.\xc2\xa0 And if there is a willingness to compromise on that, you keep building, and you can get to what\xe2\x80\x99s been called the mid-size deal.\xc2\xa0 And you can get to something even bigger if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, again, the sentiment that the President feels strongly that we should compromise, that we should do this in a balanced way, where everybody accepts that he won\xe2\x80\x99t get what he wants necessarily, everybody accepts the pain of doing things that won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be popular with elements of his or her party, is not just his.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s shared broadly and by Republicans and Democrats alike.\xc2\xa0 And as recently as today, I noticed when I -- an op-ed today by a former finance director for President George W. Bush, who made very clear that the compromise that has been outlined that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table and the balance that it represents is a win -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable outcome, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the American people, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for Americans who are Democrats and Republicans, and we should do it.\xc2\xa0 And the President is ready to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, it seems like every day there\xe2\x80\x99s more of a sort of readout of the verbal back and forth about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xc2\xa0 Not just from the White House, but from the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that that\xe2\x80\x99s damaging the talks, that it\xe2\x80\x99s slowing them down and creating more tension?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that everyone in that room is and should be focused on the task at hand, which is the need to find areas of agreement, see where other -- what areas are possible to agree on, and try to reach a bipartisan agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the most important task.\xc2\xa0 And I think if people keep focused on that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- we can achieve something significant here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about the Jell-O comment?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a real comment.\xc2\xa0 He was subtle, but it was very strongly said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, a lot gets said in public by different folks that we all -- I think from both sides -- discount because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of, as I said, sort of -- people say things to different audiences in their parties and different audiences within their caucuses.\xc2\xa0 What matters is what is being achieved in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said it was -- earlier, you said it was a congenial atmosphere, but when you have words like this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, generally. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But -- okay, generally.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So now, listening to this yesterday:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDealing with them the last couple of months has been like dealing with Jell-O -- some days it\xe2\x80\x99s firmer than others; sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s like they\xe2\x80\x99ve left it out overnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Now that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of strong.\xc2\xa0 When you really think about it, Jell-o is slippery, slimy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I like Jell-O.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I love Jell-O personally.\xc2\xa0 If you mix peas in it -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s nasty.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, but seriously, I mean, when you really think of it, when you really think of it, you can say Jell-O, but what is Jell-O? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, everybody in that room is a grownup and everybody can -- is an experienced elected official.\xc2\xa0 We can all survive some of the theater that takes place out in the public arena.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Earlier you described some of the negotiators in the Cabinet Room as posturing, as catering.\xc2\xa0 Back when President Obama was a senator and he voted against increasing the debt limit -- some critics may say that was posturing and that was catering.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would certainly say what the President has said, and which I\xe2\x80\x99ve said from here, which is he now views that as a mistake, because it\xe2\x80\x99s an important vote.\xc2\xa0 No matter how you feel about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies, you need to recognize that the United States of America cannot default on its obligations; the consequences would be calamitous.\xc2\xa0 And he has said that vote was a mistake.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t get that kind of candor very often.\xc2\xa0 He said it was a mistake and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take that vote again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is it not difficult --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, why is it not difficult then, as you say, to lead for the President having made that mistake?\xc2\xa0 Why is it not difficult for the President to lead having taken that vote when he was a U.S. senator?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 I think that acknowledging that he thinks that vote was a mistake is explicitly a recognition that this is something too important to mess around with when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made very clear that what is required of our leaders is a willingness to accept the fact that in a democracy, in a two-party system and a divided government, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get everything that you want and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get everything that your most ardent supporters wish you could in an ideal world.\xc2\xa0 You have to make compromises.\xc2\xa0 You have to do what the broad swath of the middle and the American population expects you to do, which is work together to get things done.\xc2\xa0 The kind of stuff that happens when people talk past each other and position themselves for political advantage in some small arena is stasis and gridlock, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what drives Americans crazy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This President is willing to get outside, well outside his comfort zone to get something done, something significant that people have talked about needing to be done for a long time, to address the spending that we have, which I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that everybody understands has been a long time building, in terms of deficits and debt, that 2001 -- January of 2001 there were surpluses as far as the eye could see.\xc2\xa0 A lot of credit has been rung up since then.\xc2\xa0 And the President is willing to deal with, to take responsibility for the need to solve that problem, and he expects others to as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
