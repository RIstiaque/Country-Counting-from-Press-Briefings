GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before we hear from John Brennan, the President\xe2\x80\x99s advisor on Counterterrorism and Homeland Security, I wanted to start today with an announcement.</p>\n<p>Today, Ukraine announced a landmark decision to get rid of all of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium by the time of the next Nuclear Security Summit in 2012.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine intends to remove a substantial part of its stocks this year.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine will convert its civil nuclear research facilities -- operate with low-enriched uranium fuel.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the United States has tried to make happen for more than 10 years.\xc2\xa0 The material is enough to construct several nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And this demonstrates Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s continued leadership in non-proliferation and comes in an important region where we know a lot of highly enriched uranium exists.</p>\n<p>With that, let me turn this over to John Brennan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can answer some and John and I can -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll both answer questions.</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 The threat of nuclear terrorism is real, it is serious, it is growing, and it constitutes one of the greatest threats to our national security and, indeed, to global security.</p>\n<p>Over the past two decades there has been indisputable evidence that dozens of terrorist groups have actively sought some type of weapon of mass effect.\xc2\xa0 Relative to other such potential weapons -- which include biological, chemical, radiological -- the consequences and impact of a nuclear attack would be the most devastating as well as the most lasting.</p>\n<p>Thus, the ability to obtain a nuclear weapon and to use it is the ultimate and most prized goal of terrorist groups.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda is especially notable for its longstanding interest in acquiring weapons-useable nuclear material and the requisite expertise that would allow it to develop a yield producing improvised nuclear device.</p>\n<p>Al Qaeda has been engaged in the effort to acquire a nuclear weapon for over 15 years, and its interest remains strong today.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups know that if they are able to acquire highly enriched uranium or separated plutonium and turn it into a weapon, they would have the ability not only to threaten our security and world order in an unprecedented manner, but also to kill and injure many thousands of innocent men, women and children, which is al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s sole agenda.</p>\n<p>Disturbingly, international organized criminal syndicates and criminal gangs are keenly aware of the strong interest of terrorist groups to acquire fissile material, which has prompted these criminals to pursue nuclear materials for their own personal gain.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade there has been a significant increase in the sharing of terrorism-related intelligence among nations of the world, to include intelligence on the ways and means used by al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to pursue their nuclear weapon ambitions.</p>\n<p>While this intelligence-sharing is invaluable, it must be accompanied by collective and effective action by all nations of the world to deny and to deprive terrorists and criminal groups the opportunity to gain the nuclear related material and the expertise that would allow them to fulfill their evil goals.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, our future and the future of generations yet to come depend on our ability to safeguard these materials and expertise.</p>\n<p>So while there are many different nuclear issues that the administration is addressing, there is none more important than this one.\xc2\xa0 That is why we are focusing specifically on nuclear terrorism and nuclear security over the next two days, because these issues must be addressed with a sense of focus and urgency.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With that, let us -- we\'ll all take a series of questions.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gibbs, a question for you on Ukraine and a question for Mr. Brennan, if I could, on al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 This highly enriched uranium, where is it going to be sent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The final disposition location is yet to be determined.\xc2\xa0 The announcement and the agreement obviously happened just a little bit ago.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a process that we\'ll be working on.\xc2\xa0 The United States will provide some degree of both technical and financial assistance to ensure that it happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a potential destination for (inaudible)?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s among them, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And may I ask a question of Mr. Brennan?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Of course.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned with regard to al Qaeda that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeking nuclear weapons for 15 years and you described our interest as strong -- remains strong, you said.\xc2\xa0 Could you provide any evidence that they are actively pursuing a nuclear weapon?\xc2\xa0 Are they on the black market, or anything you can point to that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing today?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think over the past 15 years you have open testimony in court about al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to, for example, try to obtain uranium in Sudan in 1994.\xc2\xa0 You have statements that al Qaeda seniors, including bin Laden and Zawahiri, have made about their determination to use and to seek those weapons.\xc2\xa0 They say it\xe2\x80\x99s in the defense of their agenda, which purports to be Muslim.\xc2\xa0 And there is a strong body of intelligence that goes back over the past decade that clearly indicates that al Qaeda is -- has been trying to procure these materials on the open market and with criminal syndicates.\xc2\xa0 So the evidence is strong, the track record is demonstrated, and we know that al Qaeda continues to pursue these materials.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, just a follow-up on that same question.\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of any effort by al Qaeda to obtain material or expertise since the meeting that took place just before 9/11 where the members -- the former members of the Khan research laboratory traveled up to talk to Osama bin Laden?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, are you aware of any efforts at this point, continuing efforts, to infiltrate that body of trained scientists in Pakistan or training outside Europe who would then come back into the labs?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There have been numerous reports over the years, over the past eight or nine years, about attempts throughout the world to obtain various types of purported material that is nuclear related.\xc2\xa0 We know that al Qaeda has been involved in a number of these efforts to acquire it.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been scammed a number of times, but we know that they continued to pursue that.\xc2\xa0 We know of individuals within the organization that have been given that responsibility.</p>\n<p>So there has been I think demonstrated interest across a number of years.\xc2\xa0 And also one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99re most concerned about this is probably the most sensitive of their efforts, and therefore it will have only very few people involved in the effort.\xc2\xa0 And therefore it requires that very good intelligence work that\xe2\x80\x99s done.</p>\n<p>And the second question as far as potential insider threat, throughout the world I think al Qaeda is looking for those vulnerabilities and facilities and stockpiles in different countries that would allow them to obtain the byproducts of nuclear reactors and materials that they can use -- but also to go after those individuals that might have access to the materials as well as individuals who have the expertise that they need to actually fabricate an improvised nuclear device.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any evidence they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually managed to do that, particularly in the Pakistan (inaudible).</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of their attempts to do that.\xc2\xa0 I would like to think that we have been able to thwart their success to date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, two questions.\xc2\xa0 Did you get -- what kind of reassurance did the President get from the Prime Minister of Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 And did you get some reassurance that they understand this issue (inaudible) what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing with their nuclear (inaudible) being so close to where al Qaeda is physically (inaudible) that they are doing everything they can to protect (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 Can you describe the nature of who these gangs are, you\'re talking about criminal gangs, organized crime -- are these Russian (inaudible).</p>\n<p>And then, Robert, could you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just -- before John gets to Pakistan, I would read you from the readout yesterday that the President indicated his appreciation of that broad based sentiment and used -- addressing the topic of the conference, reasserted the importance of nuclear security, a priority that he has reiterated for all countries.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister of Pakistan indicated his assurance that Pakistan takes nuclear security seriously and has appropriate safeguards in place.</p>\n<p>And on Poland, no decisions have yet been made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they are -- scheduling is looking at a number of possibilities.</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the details of the bilateral discussion that may have taken place, but today\xe2\x80\x99s event is a seminal one as far as nuclear security is concerned.\xc2\xa0 But also it is part of a process that was started, at least in this administration, 15 months ago, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve had regular and ongoing conversations with a number of the nations of the world, to include Pakistan, addressing the goals and objectives that we know that al Qaeda is after and what types of threat they pose to our interests and to the interests of other countries.</p>\n<p>So our engagement with Pakistan runs the full gamut as far as what al Qaeda is trying to do, whether it be to kill innocents or to carry out other types of attacks and objectives that really threaten our national security and the Pakistan national security.</p>\n<p>On the issue of those international organized crimes -- sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re criminal gangs that have information that some material had come out from the, let\xe2\x80\x99s say the area of the former Soviet Union or some stockpiles and they will try to provide that material to other groups to sell.\xc2\xa0 As I said, a lot of it is scam, you know, red mercury, whatever else.\xc2\xa0 But there are real concerns about the vulnerabilities that may exist out there as far as stockpiles that still need to be buttoned down because these criminal gangs are looking for opportunities to make money.\xc2\xa0 And it runs across continents, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just in a particular area or locale; it runs throughout Asia, Europe, the Western Hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 These gangs and criminal syndicates are trying to obtain that material.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Pakistan the number one security (inaudible)?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Our concerns are global and that\'s why the President has brought these individuals together today, which is to make sure that this is a collective action.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the President was directly engaged on exactly this question when President Zardari and President Karzai traveled to the United States in March 2009 as part of that trilateral meeting.\xc2\xa0 And I would say, as I mentioned in my announcement, I think one of the important developments out of the announcement relating to Ukraine is we understand the concentration of these types of materials in former Soviet republics.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the material from Chile, and now Ukraine, which you said could potentially come to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned, are you concerned, that the United States might have to make itself kind of a storage facility, a global storage facility for these materials?\xc2\xa0 And if so, don\xe2\x80\x99t you have another Yucca Mountain with international implications here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, the goal of this summit and the reason the President is so concerned about it is our genuine concern about the security environment in which this material is held.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about the security environment with which that material is held in this country, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in different places around the country.\xc2\xa0 The President sees, as John mentioned, the threat of this type of material falling into the hands of somebody who wants to use it for their evil designs as the number one security threat that we face as a world.</p>\n<p>So I think this is just the type of announcement that we would like to see.\xc2\xa0 I traveled with the then-senator Obama to Ukraine in 2005 with Senator Lugar.\xc2\xa0 We visited a facility that -- basically the equivalent of the Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s CDC.\xc2\xa0 We walked into a room and out of a refrigerator somebody who worked there took out a series of test tubes that were anthrax.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, I think the level at which we believe that type of material ought to be secured -- in 2005 that standard was not being met at the facility we went to.\xc2\xa0 We provide through -- on nuclear issues through the Nunn-Lugar program and in other programs the type of funding necessary to help many of these countries secure this material.\xc2\xa0 We have assisted Ukraine in a number of those projects, whether it be biological, chemical, or in this case nuclear.</p>\n<p>John, do you have anything else?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in many cases won\'t it be necessary to bring that material to the United States to make sure that it is secure?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In some instances it will be and, Chip, we welcome that.\xc2\xa0 Again, we -- there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to the American people, they don\'t even want materials from this country being transported to Yucca Mountain, how are you going to transport materials from around the world to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Safely.\xc2\xa0 As we did with Chile.\xc2\xa0 Remember, Chip, we have a choice.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 We can take a flyer on this being secured somewhere else in hopes that somebody with the type of designs that John discussed, or needless to say, in the tough economic situation, somebody working in one of these labs who needs some money making a sale.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the American people feel wholly more confident that the material of which not a huge amount can destroy an entire city -- I think they\xe2\x80\x99d feel far more secure knowing that that material is under safe lock and key and guarded in this country, rather than potentially floating around somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I have a question for you and a couple for Mr. Brennan.\xc2\xa0 You said that Ukraine is committed to having all this highly-enriched uranium disposed of by the time of the next Nuclear Security Summit.\xc2\xa0 When is the next Nuclear Security Summit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In 2012.\xc2\xa0 We will announce, likely tomorrow, the location for that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, Mr. Brennan, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, Ukraine has almost 70 kilograms of highly-enriched uranium at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, 13.2, the Institute for Nuclear Research Institute in Kiev, and up to 6.1 at the Sevastopol Naval Research Institute.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\'re talking about is all going to be disposed of, or is there additional highly-enriched uranium that we don\'t know about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that -- if my math is correct is roughly 90 kilograms -- I\'m under the impression that it\xe2\x80\x99s actually more than that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into a specific amount.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s enough, as I said, for the construction of several nuclear weapons and I would say many, many times greater than the amount that was recovered from Chile, although that obviously was an important announcement in ensuring that any of that highly-enriched uranium is now under lock and key.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I have one more crack with Mr. Brennan?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gibbs said that -- Mr. Gibbs said that the United States has been trying to do this for 10 years.\xc2\xa0 What made the difference?\xc2\xa0 Why is it happening now?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There has been an effort over many years to try to ensure that nuclear materials are going to be safeguarded. This was one of the priority items that President Obama had when he entered office and there has been a lot of work that has been done over the past 15 months in order to get to this point today, where we can bring together so many major world leaders who recognize that there is a threat out there and it requires collective action because terrorist groups and international criminal organizations will look for the weakest link in the chain, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so critically important that all countries take the responsibility seriously.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, Mr. Brennan, if you could clarify again this ongoing threat that you were talking about from these terrorist groups, al Qaeda, is there anything specific now that intelligence is telling you that this threat exists -- not just general threat over the last 10 years or the last 5 years, but anything actively going on now that intelligence can point to?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think you can point to a lot of al Qaeda activities and public statements that underscore their determination to carry out attacks against U.S., Western interests, as well as the interests of other countries and nations.\xc2\xa0 And there is a significant amount of intelligence that underlies those statements and those assessments that are public.</p>\n<p>Al Qaeda has demonstrated this determination and also extreme patience in going after particular types of capabilities.\xc2\xa0 And we know for certain that there are individuals that have been within al Qaeda that have been given this responsibility.\xc2\xa0 This is a very, very tough challenge though for us to be able to look worldwide to see where al Qaeda might be undertaking biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear programs.</p>\n<p>And so there is intelligence that indicates that al Qaeda continues its murderous agenda and continues to look toward WMD capabilities in order to carry out that agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Iran and where China is in terms of embracing tougher sanctions, can you give us an update on that?\xc2\xa0 Do they seem to be softening more to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, let me not get ahead of the meeting that I think is about 15 minutes -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re still on schedule -- from happening.\xc2\xa0 We will do a readout of what\xe2\x80\x99s discussed in the meeting afterwards.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen reports over the last several weeks of the progress that the P5-plus-1 is making, including China.\xc2\xa0 The President had a very constructive discussion with President Medvedev just a few days ago in Prague in moving this along, and I think -- I was and I think others were struck by the notion that the President outlined the desire to see steps -- next steps if Iran refused to live up to its obligations, and the first sentence out of the mouth of the Russian President was that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t disagree with that assessment.</p>\n<p>Jonathon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to take a stab again at what Chip was talking about.\xc2\xa0 These nuclear materials have half-lives in the thousands of years, if not the tens of thousands of years.\xc2\xa0 And Yucca Mountain was being designed to store material for that length of time.\xc2\xa0 Is this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Understanding, Jonathon, we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about the same material that would have been deposited in Yucca as to highly enriched uranium that we would -- and without getting -- I think you can find the location of many of the labs and security sites that we have that are fairly commonly known on where this is.</p>\n<p>So, again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I think the notion of drawing a very easily connected line to somehow Yucca, this is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you planning to blend it down for fuel?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I was about to ask.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this -- because you have --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the final disposition could easily take the form of a low-enriched uranium in order to provide for the use in a peaceful nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 I certainly think that is one of if not -- well, let me just say one of the disposition ideas.\xc2\xa0 Again, because this is a fresh announcement, the final resting place for that material -- some of it may be here, some of it may not be here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>My answer to Chip was simply to say I think when forced with the choice of having that material stored safely here or taking the risk that it may or may not be secured somewhere else, particularly in highly volatile regions in the world, our choice quite clearly is to have that here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration, though, thinking -- trying to embark on a longer term project to think about what to do with all of this HEU that you\'re trying to get?\xc2\xa0 This is a very complicated question, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just moving it from one place to another.</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 My concern, being the President\'s Counterterrorism Advisor, is that there are materials that are out there that terrorist groups are trying to go after.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure we do everything possible as soon as possible to secure those materials, those stockpiles and deny them to terrorist organizations.</p>\n<p>Clearly there are going to be a number of decisions and actions that will have to be taken in terms of the ultimate disposition and use of those materials.\xc2\xa0 But we cannot wait any longer before we lockdown these stockpiles, because we don\'t want to have any type of materials that fall into the hands of terrorist groups because the results will be devastating.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to make sure I understand this.\xc2\xa0 Is the preferred course of this administration to bring it to the United States as opposed to leaving it where it could be unsecure, in a cakes like Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, just to reiterate, this is something that -- I mean, obviously in former Soviet republics you had basically an overnight problem in the very early \xe2\x80\x9890s -- which, quite honestly, is how the Nunn-Lugar program came to be.\xc2\xa0 So Ukraine has taken a number of positive steps, including giving up a lot at the very beginning of that -- in the history of that.\xc2\xa0 But obviously our preferred action is to ensure the security.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that there will be a lot of things that are discussed with individual countries and collectively over the next few days.\xc2\xa0 Some countries have highly-enriched uranium; some don\'t.\xc2\xa0 Some can play a role in interdiction; some can play a role in security.\xc2\xa0 There are a host of roles for every nation to play, which is why the President has brought so many people here this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in those conversations, is it first option presented:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\'s among a range of options.\xc2\xa0 Our hope is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our preferred one, though, isn\'t it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- look, in some cases, with different materials, as I spoke earlier, our country has helped secure what\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xc2\xa0 In terms of highly-enriched uranium, as John said, our goal is to make sure that\'s secure.\xc2\xa0 If the most secure place is to have that here, then we\'re certainly -- that\'s certainly our goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up with John, because, John, you said, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to button down the supplies we know about.\xc2\xa0 For the average person in America who values your opinion and wants to know what do you mean by that -- what do you mean by buttoning it down?\xc2\xa0 Is it a matter of accounting?\xc2\xa0 Is it a matter of putting a number on it, having a place that we can inspect that has 16 master locks?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what is it that buttons it down?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all of the above.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that they understand exactly the nature of their stockpiles, the inventories, the security procedures that are in place at various facilities throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the movement; it\xe2\x80\x99s the transport; it\xe2\x80\x99s the people who are working at these facilities.\xc2\xa0 There is a gamut of responsibilities that nations have.\xc2\xa0 As Robert said, there are some countries that have these facilities that need to do a better job of locking down these materials and denying them the opportunity for terrorists to take advantage of whatever vulnerabilities might be out there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s why these discussions are taking place.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking place over the past 15 months at the expert level to identify all the parts of the broader nuclear security architecture that we really need to make sure is as strong as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But those commitments are non-binding, are they not?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no general enforcement mechanism or enforcement out there.\xc2\xa0 These are agreements that nations to made to each other.\xc2\xa0 What is the means by which to check to verify that these commitments are being met?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can assure you that over the course of the next two years, as I said, the United States will provide whatever technical assistance is necessary to ensure that the movement of very dangerous and not easy to handle material -- that that\'s accomplished.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Major, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\'re not signing any formal mechanism today, but I would say the commitments made between those two leaders, the President feels confident in -- in understanding as well what we\xe2\x80\x99ll then begin to\xc2\xa0 provide, along with other nations in the world, for the ability to lock this stuff down.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, this morning CNN did an interview with the President of Ukraine, and he specifically said that this would be going, this material would be going to Russia.\xc2\xa0 He did not mention the United States.\xc2\xa0 And one --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one question that I would have is, in previous cases that are carried out by the Energy Department, if the material was originally, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, from Russia, it would be returned to Russia.\xc2\xa0 If it was from the United States, it would be returned to the United States.\xc2\xa0 So it seems a bit confusing why it would come to the United States.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I simply said that it could.\xc2\xa0 The final destination -- and we talked about this before I came out here -- had yet to have been finally determined.\xc2\xa0 So again, our goal is to ensure that, whether we\'re providing the assistance for someone else to secure it, whether it comes here, there are an entire range of secure options that are exponentially better than the up-in-the-air risk that we face today with the ability for this type of material to slip out of where it is and into somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s hands that seeks to do us and other nations great harm.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems rather odd that you would announce this without knowing where that material would be going.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is 10 years in the making.\xc2\xa0 The important thing is an agreement to move it over the course of the next two years, as I said, a substantial amount of that leaving Ukraine this year.\xc2\xa0 We will work with and provide, as I said, the technical and financial assistance that\'s necessary.</p>\n<p>From our perspective, the biggest thing is an agreement to get it out and an agreement to get it under the type of security regime that is required for this type of material.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt there will be details that are going to need to be worked out between now and 2012, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to doing that, understanding that over the course of the last 10-plus years the announcement that we\'ve made today is what we\'ve been hoping to be able to say.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes that the commitment that Ukraine, the commitment that Chile and other countries have made as a result of these efforts is something that will make the world demonstrably more secure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For Mr. Brennan, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been speaking about the attempts of al Qaeda to get nuclear materials.\xc2\xa0 What is your assessment of the actual ability of al Qaeda at this point, both in terms of material, that it might happen, or in the\xc2\xa0 personnel, trained scientists who could develop a weapon -- not just their attempts, but what they can do --</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, the ability of a terrorist group to acquire weapons or expertise is directly related to the vulnerability of those materials.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to address here.\xc2\xa0 Over the years, al Qaeda -- including some senior al Qaeda members -- have claimed that they already have such nuclear capability or weapons.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not proved, but also at the same time it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to disprove something like that.\xc2\xa0 There is no indication that I have that al Qaeda has a nuclear weapons capability.\xc2\xa0 At the same time though, I am determined to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to obtain that type of capability.</p>\n<p>And the best way to do it, as we continue to degrade and destroy al Qaeda, is to take away the opportunities they may have to acquire the fissile material -- highly enriched uranium or separated plutonium -- or the expertise that is required to use that fissile material to create an improvised nuclear explosive devise.\xc2\xa0 And we have been very aggressive on this front; we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with our international partners, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But the risk of that eventuality is a factor of the determination of al Qaeda, but then the vulnerability of these materials.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what this conference today is trying to address -- the vulnerabilities that are out there that we need to close down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, with regard to Ukraine, what\xe2\x80\x99s the estimated cost to the United States to help?\xc2\xa0 And are any other --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an estimate on the financial cost at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not even a range?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are any other countries stepping up, as well, to provide technical and financial --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that, as Jill mentioned, this is Russian in origin and I think obviously they will play a significant role in helping to secure that as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are we prepared to help other countries that may step forward tomorrow or some other --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again the goal is to do all that we can -- again, understanding that our desire is to see this as secure as it possibly can be.\xc2\xa0 I think that takes many forms and our assistance and the assistance of our partners and our allies will certainly be important not just this week but in the coming years to ensure that the goal that the President has outlined of securing all vulnerable nuclear material over the course of the next four years is something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be done with a host of countries, which is quite frankly why we have so many here.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible to say if the vulnerability of the materials has increased since the end of the Cold War; has it decreased?\xc2\xa0 Is there a danger that it will increase the more countries turn to nuclear power, nuclear generation?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think one of the concerns is that, by definition, as you have expansion of nuclear programs, peaceful programs, there is going to be an increase in the nuclear byproducts that are -- that come out of those facilities, as well as the expertise that is available to run them.</p>\n<p>And so with the increasing availability of nuclear programs or the increasing prevalence of nuclear programs worldwide, this is why we want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to work with all the countries of the world so they can do their part.\xc2\xa0 But the availability of this material is going to be a factor of how well we\xe2\x80\x99re able to plug those gaps, plug those holes, and address the vulnerabilities that are out there.\xc2\xa0 But certainly nuclear programs are -- have increased over the last several decades.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the previous questions about the timing, should they get possession of this material, how long would it take a group like al Qaeda to produce weapon?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there any estimate?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems not a very easy process anyway.\xc2\xa0 Look at Iran and, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s taking years.\xc2\xa0 So what is your assessment in terms of timing?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked before about the various weapons of mass effect, whether it be biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear.\xc2\xa0 Radiological, a dirty bomb -- this is a way that al Qaeda could try to carry out a nuclear-type event, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have -- it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t produce a yield; it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a nuclear blast.</p>\n<p>So those materials may be available --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Mass effect -- well, you can have the psychological effects that are attendant to some type of WMD attack.\xc2\xa0 And so a chemical attack, a biological attack, you can have tremendous effect, but the destruction in terms of lives might be limited.\xc2\xa0 A nuclear attack, though, an improvised nuclear device, and that\xe2\x80\x99s probably the way they would go as they -- if they were able to acquire this fissile material, a lot depends on the material they were able to get, the expertise that they had, but I think they would be damned determined to try to move in that direction.\xc2\xa0 They have already said publicly that if they acquired that type of weapons capability, that they would use it.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to test the proposition of that -- that they would take a certain period of time to create such a weapon.\xc2\xa0 What we want to do is, again, try to focus on denying them the opportunity to use those materials for weapons of mass effect purposes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) -- terms of vulnerability, military, nuclear sides to the civil nuclear energy sector.\xc2\xa0 What gives you the bigger concerns, that somebody steals nuclear weapons from a military site worldwide?\xc2\xa0 Or rather, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, hijack, for example, the transport of highly enriched based?\xc2\xa0 Which is often transported (inaudible) -- cities all over the world.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the bigger concern?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have concerns both on the civilian and military side from the standpoint of facilities as well as transport as well as the security measures that are put in place at these respective facilities.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda and other groups, including criminal groups, are going to be looking for what avenues present them the best opportunity to acquire these materials.\xc2\xa0 And so they and a lot of these criminal gangs and terrorist organizations reside in countries where there are nuclear programs, including some that are part of nuclear weapons programs.</p>\n<p>And so what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to stay several steps ahead of terrorist groups by working with these countries to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to button down their facilities, but also take the appropriate steps and to institute the protocols that are necessary that will endure over time.\xc2\xa0 This is not just a one-time event here -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is continue this process that\xe2\x80\x99s been underway for a number of years that we can truly help to safeguard these materials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Every day tons are transported worldwide.\xc2\xa0 Tons.</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 A lot of things are transported on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 What we need to do is to make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s done in the most secure fashion possible.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what part of the dialogue that is taking place with other countries to ensure that as they move materials they are doing it fully aware of the vulnerabilities and the potential opportunities that terrorists might use to take advantage of that transport.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 This is a multilateral setting here where the heads of state and government get together to talk about their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be a series of multilateral fora as well as bilateral opportunities where the discussions will be taking place about what the requirements are in order to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes countries are going to require resources.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re going to require some technical support and assistance so that they can in fact put in place the procedures that are necessary.</p>\n<p>So this is going to continue to move forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be having these discussions.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the United States is willing to work very closely with other countries throughout the world so that they can take the steps that are going to help protect them, their neighbors, as well as the worldwide community.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Josh.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to speak up -- you\xe2\x80\x99re in a different area code from what it looks like.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that the U.S. sells highly enriched uranium to other countries from time to time, and is considering selling some to France right at the moment.\xc2\xa0 Is that at odds or intention with your effort to collect it and put it under lock and key here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to find somebody at NSC that has a better idea of that but I will check on that at the conclusion of this.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 How many nuclear bombs do you think North Korea has?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you can speak up, I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many nuclear bombs do you think that North Korea has?\xc2\xa0 And do you think --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 North Korea?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not, in a setting like this, going to get into discussing the type of or the nature of that.\xc2\xa0 I would just say that you have seen this administration put into effect with the unanimous vote of the Security Council last year very strict sanctions to impede North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ability to move that type of weapon or those types of materials and other types of materials out of their country through, again, a very strong sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you thinking about creating a fund to help countries that cannot afford securing the material, that can assist -- a financial fund?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you may have more on this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously there are -- again, the Nunn-Lugar program, which has been highly successful at both destroying different types of weapons systems in former Soviet Union -- former Soviet countries.\xc2\xa0 The President and Senator Lugar worked and a program was approved in 2006, largely as an -- basically as an offshoot of Nunn-Lugar, to deal strictly with conventional weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So over the years, again dating back to the collapse of the Soviet Union, and then extended in 2006 with then-Senator Obama and Senator Lugar, a renewed investment on ensuring that conventional weapons also didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall into the hands of people that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see have them.\xc2\xa0 I think we were in Ukraine, again, in 2005, with Senator Lugar, and going through a facility that was very, very slowly destroying huge stockpiles of large munitions, big shells, the type of thing that honestly could easily be strung together to create an IED, the likes of which we\'re familiar with now in Iraq and Afghanistan -- again, huge stockpiles left over from a far different era, weapons that are not nearly the type of technologically -- of the type of technology that we see today, but again in the wrong hands could easily be used to do harm throughout the world.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are you not going through the United Nations when there is a convention for protecting the nuclear materials?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say that one more time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not going through the United Nations for -- there is a convention on protection of nuclear materials.\xc2\xa0 It is kind of creating a parallel mechanism.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say the second part again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re creating a parallel mechanism.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- again, we\'re -- 46 countries are represented here, as well as a series of international organizations that the President believes are necessary to do this.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think in any way this is duplicative.\xc2\xa0 I think the President sees the strong concern for -- and John reiterated the type of -- the President reiterated the threat, John reiterated the types of groups that are seeking to control this type of material.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President strongly believes that we must do everything in our power and that that is certainly not duplicative of what the United Nations seeks to do.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did I hear you correctly when you said that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay if the uranium is moved to Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I simply said that that is one of the likely destinations for -- one of likely destinations for that type of material, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, July last year in Moscow, President Obama said that Russia was likely the next venue for the summit, the next summit.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that\'s being considered?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we will have an announcement about the next -- the location for the next Nuclear Security Summit likely tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you speak with Saudi Arabia about it, and what\xe2\x80\x99s their reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you speak with Saudi Arabia about it, and what\xe2\x80\x99s their reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To Saudi Arabia, with what you\'re trying to do at this moment?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Saudi Arabia -- and did we talk to them about what?\xc2\xa0 Talk to them about their participation here?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\'ve got a wide -- we\'ve got a great number of countries, again, I think many have shown that the greatest number of countries that have been invited and assembled in this country since the mid-1940s.\xc2\xa0 We, again -- I would say to you that there are a host of roles that the countries represented here can play.\xc2\xa0 Again, some have that highly-enriched uranium that we\'re seeking to secure.\xc2\xa0 Others can play an effort in how to secure that.\xc2\xa0 Others can play an effort in the interdiction of these types of materials in the event that they leave where they are.</p>\n<p>So I think there are a host of different roles that each nation will play here.\xc2\xa0 The President wants their strong commitment to securing this loose, vulnerable -- loose and vulnerable material over the course of the next four years.</p>\n<p>John, I\'ll take one more and then we\'ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was intrigued by the (inaudible) on the part of criminal organizations to stymie al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to obtain material.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, Mr. Brennan, if you could talk a little more about what exactly (inaudible), how that\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xc2\xa0 And also is there a greater incentive or desire now than there has been in the past for the criminal syndicates to actually sell the material, or does al Qaeda have greater sophistication or ability to detect or stop themselves from being scammed?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I said there have been a number of instances over the years that we know that criminal organizations have tried to sell materials that they claim are fissile materials.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, most of these instances have been -- have turned out to be scams.\xc2\xa0 Red mercury, other types of scams that are out there.</p>\n<p>We know that al Qaeda has been taken by some of them, but we know that al Qaeda has not been deterred at the same time.\xc2\xa0 And so they have tried to develop within the organization the expertise that would allow them to distinguish between that which is a scam and that which isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And based on, as I mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Jamal al-Fadl, who gave open testimony in court about the activities of al Qaeda in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9890s acquire uranium from Sudan as well as other types of information we have about their -- the people and their efforts to acquire these materials.</p>\n<p>So there are individuals out there that are trying to sell materials.\xc2\xa0 What we need to do is to make sure that none of that material is real.\xc2\xa0 But we are also aware of instances where there has been serious concern that materials that are being discussed have the characteristics and composition of fissile material.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.\xc2\xa0 Yes?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Secretary of State Clinton and Senator Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s charitable remarks about her possibly being on the Supreme Court?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, guys, we will have many weeks to play -- to spin the big wheel and play the name game.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Many weeks.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve no doubt that I\'ll get many calls before 6:00 a.m. each morning.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll play the name game.\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- we appreciate Senator Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s addition.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has identified in Secretary Clinton a job he thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s doing -- a capacity in which she\xe2\x80\x99s doing a wonderful job.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to keep her as his Secretary of State.</p>\n<p>I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the portion of Senator Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s comments that have gone less noticed are the comments that he thinks this has the ability and the potential to get done quite quickly.\xc2\xa0 In terms of an announcement, obviously that\'s our part --irrespective of his addition today -- but I think it is quite constructive that we see from somebody as senior as Senator Hatch, the role that he\xe2\x80\x99s played on the Judiciary Committee of moving a nominee through the process in a way that gets someone seated for the next term of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:40 P.M.
