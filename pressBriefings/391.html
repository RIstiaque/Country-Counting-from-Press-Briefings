EDT</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I like the light, social atmosphere in the room today.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can keep that going.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Lederman, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the first opportunity to keep that going.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The World Health Organization this morning acknowledged kind of dropping the ball on the initial Ebola response and missing signs that they should have caught on to.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that failure on the global level in retrospect hindered some of the initial response here in the United States.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I haven\'t seen those reports about the recent WHO comments.\xc2\xa0 What I will tell you is this administration has been focused on this Ebola outbreak since it was first reported back in March.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that CDC and USAID deployed personnel to West Africa back in the spring.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the summer, additional resources were moved to that region of the world because this administration had a keen understanding that the best way to protect the American public and to eliminate risk from the Ebola virus to the American public is to stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen CDC make the largest-ever commitment of resources and personnel to this specific effort, and that was something that was done even before this outbreak has gotten the kind of media attention that it has in the last several weeks.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to that, the President has followed up on that effort by committing significant Department of Defense resources to this effort.\xc2\xa0 By adding the Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s logistical expertise to the equation, we can leverage greater international confidence in the ongoing response effort.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased to have seen the response from countries and non-governmental organizations around the world who are focusing more time and attention and resources on this effort.\xc2\xa0 However, there is quite a bit more that can be done, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President convene a number of telephone calls over the last 48 hours or so with leaders in Japan, across Europe.\xc2\xa0 The President placed a couple of additional phone calls yesterday to try to enlist greater international support for the very serious situation that we see in West Africa right now.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, the President\xe2\x80\x99s choice to be the point man on running the Ebola response, Ron Klain, is already coming under some criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill who are saying --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s some shocking development, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not something you ever anticipated.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s shocking -- like three weeks before an Election Day and Republicans are seeking to score political points.\xc2\xa0 Stop the presses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come on, you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing us down.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re bringing down the mood.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to keep up mine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess you beat me to the punch, but do you think that they\xe2\x80\x99re scoring political points as opposed to there being any legitimate questions about whether it might be smart to have someone with some element of medical or public health expertise as opposed to a kind of a government insider to be running this kind of an operation?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re asking a good question, which is what kind of person is appropriate to fill this role.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, this is much broader than just a medical response.\xc2\xa0 The response that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the administration is a whole-of-government response to ensure we\xe2\x80\x99re leveraging the necessary resources to protect the American public.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as I mentioned earlier, USAID and the Department of Defense, in addition to CDC, have been involved in responding to the outbreak in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol play their important role in this effort, which is to monitor our borders and screen passengers from airplanes who are entering the country.\xc2\xa0 There are additional screening measures that the Department of Homeland Security put in place just within the last couple of weeks to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting the American public.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an important role to communicate with state and local leaders, including public health officials, to protect the American public.</p>\n<p class="p4">There is a significant medical component here as well, of course, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not solely a medical response.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why somebody with Mr. Klain\xe2\x80\x99s credentials, somebody that has strong management experience both inside government but also in the private sector.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody that has strong relationships with members of Congress and obviously strong relationships with those of us who worked with him here at the White House earlier in the administration.</p>\n<p class="p4">All of that means that he is the right person for the job, and he is the right person to make sure that we are integrating the interagency response to this significant challenge.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President last night when we were in the Oval Office seemed to open the door to possibly changing his approach in the future as far as a travel ban goes, saying he was not philosophically opposed to it.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could clarify whether that\xe2\x80\x99s something that increasingly is being sought as -- looked at as a viable option and something that\xe2\x80\x99s under any kind of active consideration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jeff [sic], I would encourage you to take a second look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 He did say what you were describing, which is that he is not philosophically opposed to this travel ban.\xc2\xa0 I think that indicated a willingness on the part of the President and other members of his administration to keep an open mind as we evaluate the changing circumstances here to make sure that we are putting in place the kind of tenacious approach that the American people expect from their government.</p>\n<p class="p4">At this point, however -- and I think the President was clear about this when he discussed it -- at this point, if our core priority is protecting the American public, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to put in place a travel ban.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s simply because, as the President described, putting in place a travel ban could have a pretty perverse effect on people who are seeking to travel to this country.\xc2\xa0 It would give them an incentive to not be candid, or honest even, about their travel history.</p>\n<p class="p4">Right now, by leaving those lines of -- leaving that commercial travel open, individuals who are coming to this country are properly screened.\xc2\xa0 This means that if you\xe2\x80\x99ve spent any time in West Africa, in these three countries in West Africa in the last three weeks, that you have your temperature taken, that your information is collected by CBP officers so that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to contact you urgently that we know where you are and we know how to do.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re also given important information about Ebola, both so that you can protect yourself but also protect people who are around you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And that also will enhance the kind of response that we expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see; that if an individual walks in the door of an emergency room anywhere in the country, holding that piece of paper indicating that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been advised about the risks that they face from Ebola, that we can also ensure that doctors respond in the appropriate way.</p>\n<p class="p4">So this reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to putting the protection of the American public at the top of the priority list when it comes to making decisions about things like a travel ban.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to the Islamic State, General Austin was speaking this morning and said that some of the intense fighting in and around Kobani has allowed the U.S.-led coalition to take out large numbers of Islamic State fighters, bringing them off of the battlefield for other parts of the conflict as well.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House feels that there\xe2\x80\x99s a tide that\xe2\x80\x99s been turned, or is seeing more progress in the fight there.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, General Austin would be in the best position to make that assessment.\xc2\xa0 But we have in recent days seen ISIL start to mass its fighters and materiel around Kobani.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is they are obviously seeking to make an advance into that city and essentially overrun it.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, that has created a rather target-rich environment around Kobani for American and coalition airstrikes -- that when they see clusters of fighters or they see depots of materiel and supplies that are critical to the success of those fighters, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to take them out.</p>\n<p class="p4">And so you have seen a stepped-up operational tempo in and around Kobani.\xc2\xa0 As General Austin, I believe, said just today, the United States and our coalition partners remain committed to attacking the enemy where they are.\xc2\xa0 And right now they\xe2\x80\x99re around Kobani.</p>\n<p class="p4">Mr. Holland.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when did the President decide to name Ron Klain?\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been cool to the idea of naming one of these czars.\xc2\xa0 What prompted him to change his mind?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would describe him as \xe2\x80\x9ccool\xe2\x80\x9d to this idea.\xc2\xa0 When he was asked this question in the Oval Office just last evening, the President indicated that he was pleased with the performance of his team.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think that he described the work of Lisa Monaco, his top Homeland Security Advisor, as outstanding.\xc2\xa0 I would certainly echo that sentiment.</p>\n<p class="p4">At the same time, what the President indicated is that Ms. Monaco has significant responsibilities when it comes to other national security priorities as well.\xc2\xa0 And if the President felt like it was important for someone to dedicate 100 percent of their time to coordinating our whole-of-government approach to this Ebola situation, that he would choose someone who could spend 100 percent of their time doing it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">As I mentioned, Ms. Monaco has significant other national security responsibilities, so the President made a decision to augment his team by bringing on Mr. Klain who will focus 100 percent of his time on coordinating this whole-of-government response.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Klain will ultimately, however, report directly to Ms. Monaco and to the National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, in this effort.</p>\n<p class="p4">But again, this also indicates the administration\xe2\x80\x99s tenacious approach to an evolving situation.\xc2\xa0 The President recognized that the response would benefit from having someone who could devote 100 percent of their time to this specific task -- that is coordinating the response -- and somebody like Mr. Klain, who has a strong management track record both inside government and in the private sector, is the right person for the job.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would have to happen to convince the President to impose a travel ban?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a hypothetical question, but it is something that is obviously being discussed quite a bit publicly.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an option that will continue to be on the table, but it\'s one that is not being considered right now, principally because the President believes that if we\'re going to protect the American people, the best way to do that is to ensure that individuals seeking to enter this country are going through the proper channels, and when they do so that they\xe2\x80\x99re being properly screened.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think lawmakers are playing politics with this issue by calling for a travel ban?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would leave it up to lawmakers themselves to decide what\xe2\x80\x99s motivating their claims that a travel ban is in the best interest of the American public.\xc2\xa0 The President has taken a careful look at this and was pretty clear about the conclusion that he reached yesterday.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what does Ron Klain know about Ebola?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the thing that\'s -- let me restate why this person -- why the President believes it was important to add this person to his team.\xc2\xa0 The President, again, wanted somebody who could serve in a coordinating function to manage the implementation of our whole-of-government approach to this Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0 And so I guess to more directly address your question, what we were looking for is not an Ebola expert, but rather an implementation expert.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what Ron Klain is.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has extensive experience in the federal government.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that has extensive management experience when it comes to the private sector.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when he served here at the White House he was responsible for working in the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office at a time that that office was responsible for implementing the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 Now, we\'ve talked a lot about the resilience of the U.S. economy in the last few months, the long track record of continuous private sector job growth.\xc2\xa0 The economic growth in terms of the GDP has been very strong in recent quarters.\xc2\xa0 So I think the results of the Recovery Act as it relates to the economic impact certainly speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s his title?\xc2\xa0 Is he a czar?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me finish because this is important, too.\xc2\xa0 In the context -- because, again, ultimately what we\'re looking for here is an implementation expert, and when it came to implementing the Recovery Act, that was successful not just in terms of the intended effect that it had on our economy, which was exceedingly beneficial; the Recovery Act itself exceeded expectations in terms of the timeframe in which it was implemented.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about a very complex interagency scenario that involved just about every agency of the federal government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Ron Klain has worked on the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and it was performed with unprecedented transparency.\xc2\xa0 They were putting out quarterly reports to indicate just how successful -- to indicate exactly what work was being done and how successful it was being implemented.\xc2\xa0 So that is one good example of how Mr. Klain\xe2\x80\x99s implementation expertise can be applied in this situation as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he a czar?\xc2\xa0 Is that his title?\xc2\xa0 What is his title?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 His title is he is the Ebola Response Coordinator.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are some Republicans and even some pundits who are describing him as a czar.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re certainly welcome to do that.\xc2\xa0 We describe him as the Ebola Response Coordinator.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the administration, back in 2009, said that there isn\'t anybody working for the White House that you would call a czar, so --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And we do not call him a czar.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is what Republicans and some pundits want to call him.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that is intended as a derogatory term.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it is.\xc2\xa0 Maybe some people mean it that way and some people don\'t.\xc2\xa0 We describe him as the Ebola response coordinator, and we think that he is exceedingly well suited to the task.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to report to Lisa Monaco and Susan Rice?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are they in charge of the Ebola response, or is he going to be in charge of the Ebola response?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve had the opportunity to discuss this quite a bit over the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is this administration, under the direction of the President, is pursuing a whole-of-government approach to responding to this Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0 That means there are very important areas of responsibility for the Department of Defense in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 USAID and CDC have responsibilities for some of the efforts that are underway in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 Here in this country there are important responsibilities that the CDC has for communicating with health care professionals and with hospitals across the country.\xc2\xa0 DHS has a responsibility for securing the borders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Each of those agencies is responsible for performing that work, and it\'s the responsibility of Mr. Klain to coordinate those efforts across agencies to make sure that we are maximizing this whole-of-government approach.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the buck stops with the President of the United States, as it always does.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to get back to my first question, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really have any expertise when it comes to Ebola or public health. \xc2\xa0You\'re not quarreling with that -- that statement has already been made by some critics of this choice.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure that that\'s something that --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 His area of expertise is in implementation.\xc2\xa0 And that is exactly what is needed, is somebody who can coordinate this broad interagency response.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that this tenacious response is up to the standards of the American people and up to the high standards that the President has set.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that somebody with Mr. Klain\xe2\x80\x99s management credentials both inside government and outside government -- he has a strong track record of implementing complex government policies, as evidenced by his success in implementing the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident he has all of the credentials that we could want for somebody who can implement these kinds of policies that are so critical to the safety and health of the American people.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when does he start?\xc2\xa0 He starts today?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He will start very soon.\xc2\xa0 He did not start today, but we anticipate that he\'ll be onboard very soon.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we see him out here doing briefings, or will he be talking to reporters in any capacity or to the public in any capacity?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, ultimately, his principal responsibility is going to be a coordination function.\xc2\xa0 That ultimately is something that is principally a behind-the-scenes effort.\xc2\xa0 But he also is somebody who has demonstrated throughout his career a capacity for being a very strong advocate.\xc2\xa0 So his principal responsibility will be a coordinating function, an implementing function.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to require a lot of behind-the-scenes work.\xc2\xa0 But I also wouldn\'t rule out that at some point he\'ll be in a position to be explaining his efforts to all of you.</p>\n<p class="p4">April.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you two questions.\xc2\xa0 On the travel ban, has this administration taken into account as well when they are thinking of everything, pulling everything together on the possibilities of a travel ban to or not to have a ban -- have there been conversations about the sensitivities?\xc2\xa0 If there is a travel ban, what would it do for this African nation, or what message would it send out, particularly as it would set a precedent when there was not a ban when there was Mad Cow disease in this nation?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, when we consider policy decisions like this we consider a range of consequences for those policy decisions.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll tell you the top priority -- and this takes priority over everything else -- that\'s the safety and wellbeing of the American public.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that the President has not put in place a travel ban is because he does not believe it\'s in the best interest of that top priority.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But talk to me about the sensitivities.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me if there was any conversation here?\xc2\xa0 Because it is by some viewed as a racial issue, particularly when there was not a ban when, again, using 2003, the four cases of -- these four cases of Mad Cow disease.\xc2\xa0 There was not a ban when people contracted Mad Cow disease.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I think the President was pretty clear in the Oval Office yesterday that he is not philosophically opposed to a travel ban.\xc2\xa0 We\'re certainly aware of all the consequences of putting one in place.\xc2\xa0 But the most important priority here and the priority that is driving this decision is the safety and health of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And it is not in the best interest of the safety and health of the American people for a travel or visa ban to be put in place.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, there is said to be a truce between Boko Haram and Nigeria, some kind of agreement to help to release the Nigerian girls after six months.\xc2\xa0 What components of this are you aware of?\xc2\xa0 Is it true?\xc2\xa0 And what have you been told?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am personally not aware of those reports, but I\'d refer you to my colleagues at the National Security Council that may have more information on it.</p>\n<p class="p4">Olivier.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I have a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 First, does the Khorasan Group still pose a threat to the United States?\xc2\xa0 Are they still actively plotting?\xc2\xa0 We don\'t seem to be hearing a lot about airstrikes in Iraq and Syria targeting them anymore.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the state of play?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an updated intelligence assessment to present from here.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we continue to be very concerned about threats emanating from Syria, including threats from the Khorasan Group.\xc2\xa0 And as we continue to carry out airstrikes with our coalition partners in Syria, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused principally on denying a safe haven from extremist groups that are attempting to operate in that region of the world.</p>\n<p class="p4">Obviously ISIL does get the most attention because they seem to be operating with the largest footprint there.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to be concerned about the capability and the efforts of other extremist groups that are operating in Syria, including the Khorasan Group, and it\'s something that we continue to watch very closely.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the Ebola response, the administration has talked of this -- the pre-departure screenings in those three countries in Africa and the arrival screenings now.\xc2\xa0 But as far as I can tell, the system has a zero percent success rate.\xc2\xa0 None of the people who were stopped in Africa turned out to have Ebola, and the only person who did have Ebola got through the system.\xc2\xa0 Why does that system inspire so much confidence and optimism here?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is a situation where you might be a glass half empty guy and maybe I\'m a glass half full guy.\xc2\xa0 That just goes to our disposition, maybe.\xc2\xa0 I still appreciate your point of view.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\'s part of your job description and part of mine.\xc2\xa0 It could be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">But you\'re asking a serious question -- let me try to answer it.\xc2\xa0 The goal of these screening measures that are in place both in West Africa and in the United States is to screen for individuals that are displaying symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 The reason that that is critically important is that Ebola can only be transmitted when an individual comes in contact with the bodily fluids of an individual that is exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So we want to make sure that we are protecting the transportation infrastructure certainly in this country, but across the world, and the safety and security of the American public.\xc2\xa0 So by screening for those symptoms, we can protect the American public from catching Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p4">So far, no one with Ebola symptoms has entered this country.\xc2\xa0 So I recognize that you might describe that as a zero percent success rate, but to date it\'s evident to me that we have 100 percent success rate.\xc2\xa0 But this is an ongoing effort that requires significant vigilance, and it\'s something that we -- as the President described yesterday, it\'s something that we take very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And those efforts are ongoing every day.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As part of the glass half empty, though, it seems like -- I mean, it could be a deterrent effect that people with those symptoms aren\'t bothering to try to go through the screenings.\xc2\xa0 But otherwise, it feels like luck.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as I said, just mathematically, the last time we were briefed on the numbers, no one who was turned away turned out to have Ebola, and the only person who did got through the system.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'m trying to get into why this policy is working, and I\'m not -- obviously not convinced, I guess.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The policy is intended to prevent individuals that have symptoms of Ebola from entering the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And thus far, zero individuals with symptoms of Ebola have entered the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 I think the bottom line is that that is the reason that we believe this is the right policy.</p>\n<p class="p4">It is a policy that requires significant vigilance.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that we\'re focused on on not just a daily basis, but an hourly basis.\xc2\xa0 And some of the policies that DHS is putting in place are working to make sure that those screening measures apply to as many -- to travelers to this country from that region of the world, and what you\'re seeing is not just that they\xe2\x80\x99re having their temperature taken, but contact information is being collected and other things to make sure that we can have as tight a net as possible.</p>\n<p class="p4">Justin.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you said the President was going to call leaders up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 He spoke to Leader Pelosi, Reid, and House Speaker John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 He also hinted that there might be some sort of discussion of additional funding for the Ebola response.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering now that those conversations have taken place, whether any discussion of that happened, or if you could characterize the conversation.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any additional details of the conversation to share with you.\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you that we have not made any decisions about whether additional resources are necessary, but if we determine that they are we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be working closely with our partners in Congress to try to get them.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we have seen in the last several weeks an acknowledgement from Democrats and Republicans that this is a serious issue that is worthy of the attention of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 So we anticipate that if that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have partners on Capitol Hill, but that determination has not been reached at this point.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A White House official told the Post last night that in those discussions the President asked leaders on Capitol Hill to kind of hold off on a travel ban.\xc2\xa0 Can you say if that was a part of the conversations that they had?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to give more detail about the conversation.\xc2\xa0 If there was a discussion in any of those conversations about the wisdom of a travel ban, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the President gave a case very similar to the one that you heard him deliver in the Oval Office last night.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President extend a World Series bet to Nancy Pelosi on your behalf?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want to make one now?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I should take that up with her.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That would be kind of fun.</p>\n<p class="p4">Major.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President was not \xe2\x80\x9ccool\xe2\x80\x9d to a czar, but you were from this podium.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of days ago you said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a perfectly reasonable management structure in place.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t -- or you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why you need to have Ron Klain?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Major, I think that both in those comments and in the comments that I delivered yesterday in talking about this, that we did feel confident about and continue to feel confident about the structure that\xe2\x80\x99s in place.\xc2\xa0 We believe, and we have always left open the opportunity that we might reach this conclusion, that if we needed to augment our resources that are dedicated to this effort, that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">This is in line with the kind of adaptive, tenacious approach that we have pursued so far.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, the management structure that was in place last night, before Mr. Klain was named, is the same management structure that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have today.\xc2\xa0 The difference is that Mr. Klain will step into the role of devoting 100 percent of his time to coordinating the interagency efforts of all of the federal departments that are responding to this situation.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that -- and without any criticism toward Lisa Monaco or Susan Rice -- they were getting to the point of being overwhelmed by all the decisions and information flow of this issue?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way I would describe it.\xc2\xa0 The way I would describe it is that both Dr. Rice and Ms. Monaco have other important national security priorities for which they are responsible.\xc2\xa0 And the President felt like it was important to bring someone onboard who could devote 100 percent of his time to coordinating and implementing this response to the Ebola situation.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And related to that, you told Jim that that was exactly was Lisa Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s job was at the interagency level -- implementing and collecting and coordinating all of those tasks.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s been relieved of that duty?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Monaco is -- what Mr. Klain is doing is he will devote 100 percent of his time to that effort.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Monaco has other important national security responsibilities for which she is responsible.\xc2\xa0 So by being able to step in and devote 100 percent of his time to this effort, Ms. Monaco can spend more time focused on those other important national security priorities that she\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Klain will continue, when he steps into this role, will report to directly to Ms. Monaco and Susan Rice.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll still have areas of responsibility when it comes to our Ebola response, but ultimately it will be Mr. Klain who is dedicating all of his time to coordinating this broad interagency effort.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s say there\xe2\x80\x99s a situation where the experts have advised Ron that a school doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to shut down for a second day -- just as a hypothetical, if it happened in Cleveland -- would he be the one to call and say, look, on behalf of the White House, on behalf of the CDC, I\xe2\x80\x99m the person who\xe2\x80\x99s coordinating this for the President, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really think you need to go to this level of security, so don\xe2\x80\x99t do that?\xc2\xa0 Would he be the kind of person to do that?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to sort of engage this kind of hypothetical situation, but against my better judgment -- (laughter) -- since it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a shot.</p>\n<p class="p4">I think this goes to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to convey.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out what that person would do -- because all sorts of things are happening.\xc2\xa0 People are positioning themselves and using abundance of caution, but in ways that may not actually be helpful economically or optically or whatever, and I would assume that the White House would have more than passing interest in some of the things that are being carried out as the public reacts to this.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if Ron would be so empowered, because he has 100 percent of his time on this task, to do that kind of follow-up.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make -- and this is something that we have discussed over the last couple of days -- is that there are specific agencies that are responsible for their areas of expertise.\xc2\xa0 So when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about schools, the Department of Education is involved in communicating with school districts all across the country on a whole wide range of things.\xc2\xa0 So there might be a role for the Department of Education to play.</p>\n<p class="p4">We would also urge that as people, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re school administrators or business owners, that they\xe2\x80\x99re relying on medical expertise as they\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions about how best to protect their communities or to protect their employees.\xc2\xa0 And we would expect that they\xe2\x80\x99d be able to get that medical advice either from the CDC or the HHS, or from their state and local health workers.</p>\n<p class="p4">So there are clear lines of responsibility in terms of who is in charge of what.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Klain will have the responsibility of ensuring that all of the agencies are properly coordinating on that effort.\xc2\xa0 But at the end of the day, the buck stops with the President of the United States.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And you invited us to look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in the Oval Office yesterday, and the President said at the very tail-end, \xe2\x80\x9cAn all-out travel ban may not be the best way to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There are conversations that are less than an all-out travel ban that talk about targeted restrictions under certain circumstances, in certain geographic areas, in order to prevent unnecessary or unwanted exposure from people coming.\xc2\xa0 I understand the President is opposed to an all-out travel ban, but in his remarks yesterday he did seem to leave open an ongoing conversation and possible implementation of something that is less blunt than an all-out travel ban, that may have targeted restrictions either by geography or by circumstance.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair interpretation of where the President is?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, I know this was an issue that was discussed at Dr. Frieden\xe2\x80\x99s hearing with Congress yesterday -- because I think there are some in Congress who are advocating something less than an all-out travel ban, but something that might be more targeted along the lines that you\xe2\x80\x99re describing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">I think what the President was demonstrating in the Oval Office was his openness to implementing policies that he believes will do the most to protect the American public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t oppose that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So thank you for helping me make my point, which is, if it assessed that there might be other aspects of our travel policies that would strengthen the health and security of the American public, then the President won\xe2\x80\x99t just consider them, he\xe2\x80\x99ll implement them.\xc2\xa0 He applied -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that he applied that to a specific tailored approach, he said that was true of an all-out travel ban.\xc2\xa0 If he concluded that an all-out travel ban actually would be in the best interest of protecting the health and safety of the American public, if circumstances changed on the ground in a way that an all-out travel ban needed to be implemented, the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to do that for two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is, he\xe2\x80\x99s not philosophically opposed to an all-out travel ban.\xc2\xa0 And two, the guiding principle will always be what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the American people and their health and welfare and safety.</p>\n<p class="p4">So if we determine that some sort of targeted approach that relies on things like time and circumstance would enhance the safety of the American public, then it\xe2\x80\x99s not only something we\xe2\x80\x99d consider, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99d implement.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to evaluate as we move forward, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that is being evaluated on a regular basis.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 This also came up at the hearing, that there is a push within the public health community and the world health community to try to find not a vaccine, because that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a very long time, but a portable method, like a pinprick for someone who has diabetes, of determining whether or not somebody tests reasonably positive or perfectly positive for Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And that would be a way of isolating on the ground in the affected countries immediately, so you can either quarantine or move people in certain healthful-non-healthful directions, and that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of conversation that this a huge push within the U.N., the United States government, all the conversations the President is having with other world leaders about trying to ramp this up as fast as possible.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information about the effort involved there or the efficacy of something like that to deal with this situation?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that one of the ways in which the United States has played a leading role in this effort is that there is significant scientific expertise that we can bring to this matter.\xc2\xa0 For decades, the United States has been intimately involved in responding to Ebola outbreaks in Africa.\xc2\xa0 And the United States continues to play a leading role in doing research on vaccines and evaluating different treatment protocols for those who have contracted Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p4">For more details on those sorts of scientific developments and those sorts of scientific studies that are underway, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the NIH who may have some more information about. \xc2\xa0Failing that, my colleagues at HHS may be able to provide you some additional information.</p>\n<p class="p4">So, James, welcome to the briefing room.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you here.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to be back.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 A few lines of inquiry on Mr. Klain and then two on Syria if I could.\xc2\xa0 First, was Mr. Klain the first choice of the White House for this position, or were other approached prior to approaching Mr. Klain?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Klain was the President\xe2\x80\x99s first choice for this responsibility, principally because of his strong track record of -- because of his strong management credentials both in the government but also in the private sector.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be a salaried employee of the executive branch?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what sorts of logistical arrangements have been made for Mr. Klain, but we can certainly get that information for you once it\xe2\x80\x99s settled.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be paid a salary of some kind?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer -- I assume so, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 But once we have greater clarity on that we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as you know, James, we obviously release the -- publicly release the salaries of White House officials on an annual basis.</p>\n<p class="p4"><br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the White House consider the application of the term \xe2\x80\x9cczar\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr. Klain to be pejorative?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you probably have to ask -- let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 I think you can get a variety of opinions depending on who you ask.\xc2\xa0 As far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, you can call him anything you want.\xc2\xa0 We call him the Ebola Response Coordinator.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, would you regard it as inaccurate or pejorative for us to describe him as a czar?\xc2\xa0 If you felt so, you would be free to say so from the podium, it seems to me.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is nobody who, as far as I know, is in any way restraining me from sharing my candid opinion with you on a variety of topics.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as you know.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As far as I know.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer to talk to you about baseball, for example.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk to you about this topic fully.\xc2\xa0 Candidly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you call him.\xc2\xa0 We call him the Ebola Response Coordinator.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Klain may care what you call him, but we call him the Ebola Response Coordinator.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can check with him on our behalf.\xc2\xa0 On this question of travel bans or visa bans, you\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated from the podium today that it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that President would hesitate to do if he thought it would be more effective than what is presently being pursued.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presumably then, it is only a matter of efficacy that is preventing him from employing this approach.\xc2\xa0 It is not some perceived lack of presidential authority to implement such bans, correct?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That prospect has not been raised for me.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re keeping an open mind about pursuing it, it seems then that there\xe2\x80\x99s already been a determination that it would be lawful for the President to do it.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that determination has been made.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that anybody has raised any objection or suggested that somehow it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t within the authority of the executive branch to put in place some sort of ban like that to protect the health and safety of the American public.\xc2\xa0 So you might --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- here today, you believe he does have this authority --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to dispense legal advice to the President or to anybody else, frankly.\xc2\xa0 So you could check with a lawyer on that issue.\xc2\xa0 But I have not -- what I can tell you is that in the variety of meetings that I\xe2\x80\x99ve participated in on this topic, I have not heard anybody raise the prospect that the executive branch didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the necessary authority to take a step like a travel ban.\xc2\xa0 Now, that being said, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been, frankly, careful consideration of a travel ban because even a cursory review of the impact of a travel ban would lead just about every expert to conclude that it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of the safety and health of the American public to put one in place.</p>\n<p class="p4">So my point is, we haven\'t spent a whole lot of time researching what sort of authority would be used to put in place a travel ban because we don\xe2\x80\x99t think a travel ban is a good thing to put in place.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that the appointment of Mr. Klain has come about because President Obama recognize the need for there to be somebody in such position who could devote 100 percent of his time to the Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0 When exactly did it dawn on President Obama that Lisa Monaco wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to devote 100 percent of her time to the Ebola situation?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ms. Monaco has, throughout our response to this situation, continued to be responsible for a range of other core national security priorities that she carefully monitors and works on here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 So she has not been in a position in which she has dedicated 100 percent of her time to the Ebola response.\xc2\xa0 She, however, has done, even using her limited time, an outstanding job in ensuring that the efforts of agencies all across the government are properly integrated in this response.\xc2\xa0 But there will be a benefit to Mr. Klain and somebody with his set of management credentials devoting 100 percent of his time to this effort.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, what about the Ebola situation developed and when did it develop to the point where the President realized he needs someone who can devote 100 percent of his time?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to assume that he has always known that Ms. Monaco would not be able to do that.\xc2\xa0 He was okay with that situation just 48 hours ago and just 24 hours ago.\xc2\xa0 So when did it dawn on him he needs someone who can devote 100 percent of their time?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you know, James, the President has spent a significant amount of time in the last couple of days in particular with his team who is responding to this particular situation and he has been carefully assessing the response that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place.\xc2\xa0 As he described yesterday, he believes that Ms. Monaco and the National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, have both done an outstanding job on this.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What changed that he suddenly decided, I need somebody who can devote 100 percent of their time?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he believes that having somebody who can devote 100 percent of their time will be beneficial to this broader effort.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear.\xc2\xa0 What changed?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If you have a series of questions we may want to get to them, because I want to make sure we get around the room here.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking what was motivating his choice of this individual.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it would be beneficial to the response to have somebody with Mr. Klain\xe2\x80\x99s management credentials focused on this task 100 percent of the time.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because this has become a non-responsive exercise, I will move on to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Number one is --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep it to two, and then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move on, okay?</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear, others have made clear this is a multipronged effort of which the military piece is only one prong.\xc2\xa0 Another important prong of the effort as it has been described to us is the arming, equipping and training of Syria rebel forces who are moderate and vetted.\xc2\xa0 In the more than one month that has passed since the President gave his primetime address, how\xe2\x80\x99s that going?\xc2\xa0 What progress has been made in the arming, training and equipping of moderate and vetted Syrian rebels?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones that are taking the lead on that effort.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, on the Khorasan Group, following up on Olivier Knox\xe2\x80\x99s question, prior to the commencement of U.S. and allied airstrikes in Syria recently was there any evidence ever that the Khorasan Group had advanced beyond the plotting stage in any particular attack?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I can share with you is the intelligence assessment that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from other senior administration officials that we believe that the Khorasan Group was nearing the execution phase of a plot against the United States, and that is why the President ordered the strikes in Syria against them.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But prior to that point, had there ever been any other attack with which they were associated and which had moved beyond the plotting stage?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t provide an intelligence assessment on that issue from here.</p>\n<p class="p4">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the disease itself, Ebola, even carries more fear than perhaps is warranted, and part of the problem seems to be a lack of confidence in the American people right now in the response.\xc2\xa0 And part of that seems to be caused by health workers in this country who have dealt with this problem traveling around, including one now on a cruise ship, several who -- and the other one who traveled around the country the other day.\xc2\xa0 Is the President as flabbergasted as the rest of us that this is going on with health workers?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a couple of these issues, Jim, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you raise them.\xc2\xa0 The first is, as it relates to the hospital employee that is on that cruise ship, you saw from the State Department in their statement last night that this is an individual who had been responsible for handling the laboratory specimens of the patient.\xc2\xa0 Obviously an individual who is in that role is facing a much lower risk than some of the health care workers that are being so closely monitored in Dallas right now.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second thing is, as it relates to the travel of these two individuals, that travel commenced prior to the first health care worker testing positive for Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So once that first health care worker tested positive for Ebola, the assessment of risk changed and the monitoring regime for all of the health care workers that came into contact with the patient or his laboratory specimens changed.\xc2\xa0 So essentially those monitoring regiments changed after those individuals had already traveled.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, Dr. Frieden himself has addressed whether or not the second health care worker should have returned from Ohio on a commercial aircraft.\xc2\xa0 He said that that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened, and that was the result of an error that occurred at the Centers for Disease Control.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, even given all those circumstances, the thing that our medical experts tell us is that event those individuals who are on the plane with the second health care worker, that the risk that they face is low.\xc2\xa0 But the CDC does believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s prudent for those individuals to be in contact with the CDC.\xc2\xa0 I believe that they have been in touch with the vast majority, if not all of the passengers, and will be working with them to ensure that they understand accurately the risks that they face and that they are getting the kind of support that they need in terms of answering their questions about this situation.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I understand all that.\xc2\xa0 But fear, perhaps even outsized fear, is a major factor here in this disease.\xc2\xa0 And when health care workers themselves are not overly careful, and, in fact, you have a situation -- now it\xe2\x80\x99s become an international incident where this health care worker on the cruise ship can\'t even get back to this country because the other countries won\xe2\x80\x99t let the ship go to port -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time for somebody in the administration to stand up and say publicly to health care workers, stay put, don\'t travel around, don\'t frighten the American public?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, first of all, we\'re talking about health care workers here that, particularly in the situation in Dallas, were willing to step up to the plate and assume some risk to themselves in order to care for a victim of this terrible disease.\xc2\xa0 And that is a decision that demonstrates a lot of character and I think is consistent with the kind of spirit that makes the citizens of this country so proud of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think today is a day for us to be reminded -- particularly with the emergence of this video of the first health care worker that was taken in her room in Dallas before she was transported to NIH -- this is a young woman who assumed significant personal risk, even more personal risk than she originally thought, not because she thought it would get her fame or glory, not because she thought it would get her a raise; she did this because it was her job and because she\xe2\x80\x99s passionate about her job and caring for someone who is sick, someone she didn\'t even know.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is worthy of praise and acclaim and attention.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the CDC has a responsibility to make sure that they are communicating clearly with these health care workers that do face an elevated risk.\xc2\xa0 And that is what the CDC has done, particularly in light of at least two of their coworkers testing positive for the Ebola virus.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Juliette.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions back on the Ebola Response Coordinator.\xc2\xa0 First is can you clarify what Ron Klain\xe2\x80\x99s relationship is going to be with the military in terms of the response in Africa?\xc2\xa0 Because is that also something you would be coordinating, or is that operating separately?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The coordination function that he will perform includes both activities that are taking place here in the United States to detect, isolate and treat Ebola patients in a way that protects the American public and health care workers here in this country.\xc2\xa0 It also includes coordinating the activities of a variety of federal agencies overseas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">There is an effort underway by CDC, USAID and the Department of Defense to try to stop this outbreak at the source in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 Our experts tell us that the only way that we can completely eliminate risk from the Ebola virus is to stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen CDC and USAID officials on the ground in West Africa since this spring when this outbreak first occurred.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President commit significant logistical resources from the Department of Defense to assist in that response effort.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Klain will have the responsibility of ensuring that all of those efforts are properly integrated into the overall whole-of-government approach that we\'re taking here.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just following up on one other thing, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this focus on implementation.\xc2\xa0 The President and Denis McDonough created a deputy chief of staff position for policy implementation a few months back.\xc2\xa0 Obviously part of it was to try to deal with emerging issues that have interagency components.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about why there was a need to do this, or what it might say about kind of the limited staffing that you have at the White House that there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to bring someone else in to do policy implementation when you do have a designated post for that?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\'re referring to Ms. Canegallo, my colleague who is the Deputy Chief of Staff here at the White House for implementation.\xc2\xa0 She also does excellent work and she is somebody who has demonstrated on a variety of occasions the kind of tremendous capability that the President expects from members of his senior staff.\xc2\xa0 And from a range of national security issues to the implementation of health care reform, she has demonstrated an ability to handle a lot of different highly sensitive topics and complete them exceedingly well.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, she has important responsibilities, and this coordination function requires somebody who could dedicate 100 percent of their time.\xc2\xa0 So I guess in short what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we\'re confident that Mr. Klain is somebody who has the kind of management credentials that will allow him to succeed in this effort because he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to dedicate 100 percent of his time to just focusing on this particular response.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I assume this open -- right now this is an open-ended commitment?\xc2\xa0 There is no specific time frame for how long Mr. Klain will be appointed?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe there is -- that the expectation is that this is not a permanent commitment; that we\'re looking at something on the order of five or six months.\xc2\xa0 But we can get you some greater clarity on that as he assumes this role.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tamara.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m still a little unclear on exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xc2\xa0 Will he make decisions?\xc2\xa0 Will he sort of explore the policy things?\xc2\xa0 Will he be leading up the exploration of whether some partial travel ban or changes to -- policy changes -- will he be doing that?\xc2\xa0 Or will he just be doing conference calls and stuff? (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what you can assume Mr. Klain\xe2\x80\x99s role will be, it will be an important high-level implementation role, and ultimately it will be his responsibility to make sure that all of the government agencies who are responsible for aspects of this response, that their efforts are carefully integrated.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also will be playing a role in making sure that decisions get made -- that a lot of the decisions that we\'re talking about here have different equities, so Major used the example of a school.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a situation where you have HHS, CDC, the Department of Education all with a point of view, and all with a legitimate perspective on a policy decision that should be made. So it will be Mr. Klain\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility not to make that decision overruling these other government agencies, but rather to convene the kinds of conversations that are necessary to make these decisions that reflect the government\xe2\x80\x99s equities and to make sure that those decisions happen promptly.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Klain has -- this is a special area of his expertise.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody that has spent a lot of time in high-level government positions in this administration and in previous administrations ensuring that these kinds of decisions get made properly.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he spent a lot of time implementing the Recovery Act with tremendous results for our economy but also in a way that was consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency.\xc2\xa0 There was a -- somebody who was responsible for monitoring that program to assess the level of fraud.\xc2\xa0 There was an extraordinarily low level of fraud associated with the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 That is also a testament to the management skills of the Vice President and Mr. Klain, who was his chief of staff at the time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think all of that leads you to -- at least it leads me to the conclusion that somebody with this set of management experience and this is somebody that has the kind of solid working relationships with members of Congress, with members of the administration, with state and local officials across the country, can guide a broader process that will drive decisions and making sure that we\'re putting in place the kind of tenacious policy response that the American people can expect.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he be talking to the President on a semi-regular basis, updating and briefing him?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch with the President as often as Ms. Monaco and the National Security Advisor determine is necessary.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President for the last several weeks has been making a lot questions about the international response.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s said that the international community hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done enough.\xc2\xa0 For the last four or five weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99s been making that same comment. What exactly does he want from the international community?\xc2\xa0 What has he been able to get so far?\xc2\xa0 And why has he seemed to have trouble getting everyone on board?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99d -- let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just said that in public; the President said it in private.\xc2\xa0 You recall that he conducted a phone call with the Prime Minister of Japan a couple of days ago.\xc2\xa0 He convened a meeting of European leaders via secure video teleconference to talk about the international response to this issue.\xc2\xa0 Just yesterday the President talked to the Prime Minister of Sweden about this.\xc2\xa0 I did note as I was reading my clips last night that hours after hanging up the phone with the President of the United States that the government of Sweden committed another $10 million or $12 million to this effort.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s indicative of I think at least one small-bore example of the President getting results.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think the expectation the President has is that the response from individual countries across the world should reflect the severity of the situation in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 We need a substantial commitment of resources and expertise from countries around the world to make sure that we are confronting the worst Ebola outbreak ever.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a significant commitment of American resources to this effort.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense is using their logistical expertise in a way that will significantly enhance their response.\xc2\xa0 I think that will inspire the confidence of the world that their investment of money and resources to this response effort will be well spent.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is in the clear interest of countries around the world and the United States that this response move expeditiously to stop this outbreak at the source.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it more about money or is there more to it than that?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly about money.\xc2\xa0 It also is about expertise and personnel who can make sure that we are getting out the word to people in West Africa about how they can avoid contracting Ebola.\xc2\xa0 It also means health care professionals who can treat Ebola patients.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of things that are needed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">For a more detailed assessment of what is actually needed on the ground right now, I\xe2\x80\x99d actually refer you to the USAID.\xc2\xa0 They may be able to give you a better assessment.\xc2\xa0 They have personnel that\'s working in communities across these three countries trying to maximize the impact of the response.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last one.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any level of frustration?\xc2\xa0 Since the President has been making this comment for several weeks, is there any level of frustration that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get the international community to do as much as he\xe2\x80\x99d like them to do?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen commitments from countries across the world; we just haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen as much as we would like. And so I think that you could describe the President as somebody who feels a sense of urgency about this situation.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that Mr. Klain will be largely behind the scenes in this coordinating role, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s been any discussion about having a more singular voice in terms of messaging from the administration, given the level of fear and seeming to be -- continuing belief in things that are, frankly, misinformation.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a coincidence that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President two days in a row talking about this issue.\xc2\xa0 I think he speaks -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty singular voice in terms of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s response.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">The fact of the matter is that there are a variety of government agencies that are leveraging their expertise to try to deal with this situation and protect the American public.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s why you see people like the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson talking about this issue.\xc2\xa0 It\'s certainly why you see medical experts like Tom Frieden and Anthony Fauci talking about the role that they have to play as the relates to protecting the health and safety of the American public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">I believe it was two weeks ago today you saw a news conference that was convened in this very room.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here, but Lisa Monaco and General Rodriquez from AFRICOM was here, alongside Administrator of USAID and others, to demonstrate to all of you that we\'re pursuing a whole-of-government approach to this situation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that whole-of-government approach is evidenced by the fact you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about it quite a bit lately, but it also is evidenced by the fact that there are other Cabinet-level officials and medical experts who are also communicating the facts to the American public about what we\'re doing to respond to the Ebola virus, and to help people understand exactly what level of risk they face.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess that exactly makes my point, which is that there does seem to still be misinformation out there, and clearly fear -- we\'ve seen some of the reactions that have happened across the country.\xc2\xa0 And is it possible that some of that is because people have heard from so many different voices within the administration and don\'t have one familiar face to turn to?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think so, Chris.\xc2\xa0 I think what they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from all of these different members of the administration is the same thing, which is that the risk of an Ebola outbreak -- a widespread Ebola outbreak in the United States is exceedingly low, that the risk to the average person is exceedingly low in terms of catching Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p4">There are two Americans that have contracted Ebola in this country, and again, those are two health care workers that assumed some personal risk to try to meet the needs of a patient who was stricken with Ebola.\xc2\xa0 They obviously were at a different level of risk than the average American.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is people can take solace in the facts and in understanding exactly what we\'re doing to deal with the situation.\xc2\xa0 One thing they should understand is exactly how one catches Ebola.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t catch Ebola through the air.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t catch Ebola by drinking the water or eating the food in this country. \xc2\xa0You catch Ebola only by coming into the close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual that is demonstrating, exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p4">It\'s important for people to understand that.\xc2\xa0 And again -- I mentioned this to Jim yesterday -- when he appears on CNN, it\'s true when you appear on NBC, when people see your face and they see the NBC logo in the corner of the screen, they know that they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from a trusted voice.\xc2\xa0 And so we certainly are counting on people like you who have that kind of status with the American public to help them understand exactly how they\xe2\x80\x99re affected by ongoing events in the world.\xc2\xa0 And this is I think a terrific example of that.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you taking a jab at the media, Josh?</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My family thinks --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s true.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a subtle jab at the media?\xc2\xa0 Is that what --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 People get their information by watching your network, and they rely on you for accurate information about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the world and how what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the world affects them.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that you have the jobs that you do is because people trust you.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an important responsibility.\xc2\xa0 I know at least the people in this room take that responsibility seriously.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we spend so much time talking to you about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening -- that we want to help you help people across the country understand exactly what this government is doing to keep them safe, and to help them understand exactly what risk, what level of risk they face.\xc2\xa0 In this case, that risk is exceedingly low for the average American.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You suggested, Josh, that you were not surprised that some of the Republicans were critical --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I regret that I\'ve become so cynical in --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and perhaps suggest that politics may have played a role in some of those comments.\xc2\xa0 But a couple of weeks before the election, I\'m assuming you will say that this was a public health decision, not a political one.\xc2\xa0 But was there Democratic pressure particularly from those who are running in just a few weeks for election or reelection to do something?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll tell you that the sense of urgency that everybody in this administration feels is not from politicians, it\'s from the American people -- that they have high expectations for their government to keep them safe and --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But was there was pressure from those members of Congress?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 Look, if you read -- those people who are paying very close and careful attention to what members of Congress say can probably find a quote or two from members of Congress saying that something like this would be a good idea.\xc2\xa0 But again, what we are focused on is making sure that we\'re protecting the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that the President believes is his first responsibility as the Commander-in-Chief and as the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And those are -- that\'s the sentiment that is driving this response, and that is the value that is driving the decision to ask Mr. Klain to step into this role.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you say he\'s going to start soon, but do you have any sense of when we will see him or hear comments from him?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t at this point, but we\'ll let you know, obviously.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mark, did you have your hand up earlier?</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to just ask whether you\'re deputizing us as sort of Ebola czars to represent the policy to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If you choose to assume that responsibility, we\'re happy to work with you on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d probably do a better job if we went to the meetings in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the last couple of days you guys have been in the end of the meetings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not quite the same.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not quite the same.\xc2\xa0 I would concede that.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t deputize him.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned his problem with the credit card in New York a few weeks ago when he was signing the executive order today.\xc2\xa0 Did anyone find out why his credit card for dinner at a restaurant in New York City was not accepted?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\'m hearing about this incident for the first time today.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When signing the executive order he said that he went out to dinner in New York City during U.N. week and it was fortunate that Michelle had her credit card because his was rejected.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not able to speak to the current status of the presidential credit card.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might OMB know? (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They might.\xc2\xa0 I think the thing that is still unclear is whether or not the President left a tip at the bottom of the executive order when he was signing.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooohh --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It seemed funnier when I told that joke in my office before I came down here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Maybe we\'re all getting a little tired.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">I\'ll give you the last one and then we\'ll move on.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your staff says it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that funny to them -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, really?\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be fact-checked for that, because they might get some Pinocchios.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did the President decide to ask Ron Klain to serve in this role?\xc2\xa0 Had they already had a conversation when he said last night that this may be necessary?\xc2\xa0 Or did this all transpire -- the President made his decision and selected somebody and you announced it literally in a matter of hours?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess to give you a short answer to that question, this happened this morning.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He called?</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He spoke to Ron Klain for the first time this morning and asked him to serve in this role?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that there were -- we\'ll have to get you some more information on this if we can about the conversations with Mr. Klain.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Klain accepted this responsibility this morning and that\'s when the decision was made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s when the President decided that one person was needed to be an Ebola response coordinator?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Let me just do a quick week ahead and then we\'ll let you guys get started on your weekend.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I assume you guys are looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are working through the day.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s good.\xc2\xa0 That\'s good.\xc2\xa0 As self-anointed\xc2\xa0Ebola czars, I\'d expect nothing less.</p>\n<p class="p4">What I can tell you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule next week is it remains in flux.\xc2\xa0 The President, however, on Sunday, will be participating in a campaign event in Maryland prior to traveling to Chicago, where he\'ll spend the night on Sunday night.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will have a couple of activities in Chicago before returning to Washington on Monday night.</p>\n<p class="p4">His schedule Tuesday through Friday --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The ones on Monday will be official?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will get some additional guidance on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that in front of me.\xc2\xa0 I believe that it\'s a little of both, but we\'ll check on that for you.</p>\n<p class="p4">And then, his schedule Tuesday through Friday remains in flux at this point, but if we can get you some more details over the weekend, we will.\xc2\xa0 If not, we\'ll at least get you some more guidance on Monday.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As things stand now, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go ahead and do the campaign event.\xc2\xa0 Does that reflect the judgment on his part that the state of the crisis atmosphere is such that it\'s appropriate for him to do that?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has spent a lot of time focused on ensuring that our response to this particular situation with Ebola is up to the standards that he expects from his administration on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that even while the President is traveling he will have to spend some time and energy on the Ebola response situation, whether it\'s doing some phone calls or receiving some briefings.\xc2\xa0 But the President is confident that he will be able to both continue the work on the Ebola response even while he\'s traveling.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And that\'s the -- this is the decision that we always have to make on this, is can the President do what needs to get done even while he\xe2\x80\x99s on the road.\xc2\xa0 And it was the assessment earlier this week that on Wednesday and Thursday it was necessary for the President to remain at the White House so that he could be focused on these things.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll continue to work on these things even while he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling Sunday night into Monday.</p>\n<p class="p4">All right, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a great weekend.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:27 P.M.
