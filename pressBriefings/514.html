Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">1:48 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, it is a good, good day here at the White House.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they 0 and 1?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a long season, my friend.\xc2\xa0 Although I was a little stressed out, I have to say.\xc2\xa0 It\'s amazing when the season starts, all your biorhythms change.\xc2\xa0 But what a wonderful thing for Red Sox fans here at the White House today, and I hope for the Red Sox themselves.\xc2\xa0 I know the President enjoyed the event and those of us who attended sure did enjoy it.\xc2\xa0 So hats off to the Boston Red Sox -- World Champions.\xc2\xa0 Let me toss this to my trusty companion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">It\xe2\x80\x99s a good day for another reason.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been at the White House from the very beginning and have seen people say that meaningful health care reform could not be done more times than I can count.\xc2\xa0 From before the law passed when such a transformation of the health care system was thought to be politically impossible to the day that it reached the Supreme Court, throughout an election year when it was the principal subject of debate, and from October, when critics said the website could not recover, much less reach independent experts\xe2\x80\x99 predictions on how many people would sign up -- even those independent experts lowered their estimates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But with the remarkable surge in enrollment, 7,041,000 people signed up for health insurance before the midnight deadline yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count the last-day surge in signups in more than a dozen states that run their own marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 We surpassed the 7 million mark with the over 200,000 people who enrolled yesterday in states run by the federal government alone.\xc2\xa0 When we get numbers in from the rest of the states and people who were trying to sign up by the deadline and are finishing now, even more people will be covered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But what makes the law a success is not just that hardworking families will have good, affordable coverage that will be there when they need it and does what it is supposed to do, it\'s that millions more will have coverage through the Medicaid expansion; that discrimination against preexisting conditions is a thing of the past; that women will no longer be discriminated against in health coverage; and that entrepreneurs and the self-employed will finally have good, attainable coverage for themselves and their families.\xc2\xa0 And since the law passed the growth in health care costs has slowed to its lowest level on record.</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, I could go on -- and I have a feeling I will -- but I hope the fact that this 7 million number has been reached allows us all to step back and look at the sweeping, positive change that the law has ushered in to strengthen health security for every American as they go through life.</p>\n<p class="p3">Republicans have spent millions on false, negative ads.\xc2\xa0 They blocked Medicaid expansion in dozens of states.\xc2\xa0 They shut down the government and voted over 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 But that effort could not stop this law from working, and it could not stop middle-class families from getting the health care security that they deserve.</p>\n<p class="p3">Amazingly, just this week, the Speaker recommitted Republicans to their strategy of repealing the law.\xc2\xa0 I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll ask the Speaker this:\xc2\xa0 How will that effort to repeal the law ensure that Americans have access to the same quality health care that members of Congress have?\xc2\xa0 I\'d love to hear the answer.</p>\n<p class="p3">Nedra.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sort of breakdown -- how many of those 7,041,000 were previously uninsured, or any demographic data?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have none of the breakdown data at this point.\xc2\xa0 The experts over at CMS and HHS will be working on that, both the demographics and the issue of the percentage that paid.</p>\n<p class="p2">But on both issues, let\xe2\x80\x99s step back for a moment.\xc2\xa0 When you buy health insurance from a private provider, you enter into a contract.\xc2\xa0 And long before the Affordable Care Act was even contemplated and certainly before it became law, a lot of people bought health insurance and the overwhelming majority of them paid for their health insurance on time.\xc2\xa0 There will be nothing different about this.\xc2\xa0 There is nothing different about the kind of contract that you have with a private insurer through the marketplaces than existed in the past, save for the minimum level of benefits that are required by the Affordable Care Act, save for all the protections that the Affordable Care Act puts into place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But we expect that -- and issuers have anecdotally suggested that they are seeing this -- folks who get health insurance through the marketplaces will pay their premiums in the manner that they have in the past.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.</p>\n<p class="p2">On the issue of demographics, again, I point you to what the insurers themselves have said and the statements that they have made about the increase in the enrollment of young adults as we\xe2\x80\x99ve come closer to the deadline, as we approached the deadline -- that was something fully anticipated -- and statements that issuers have made that they feel good about the breakdown, the demographic breakdown that they\'re seeing already.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">There has been the red herring put forward many times about the so-called 40 percent figure, which is simply the percentage of the uninsured who are young adults.\xc2\xa0 It is not the percentage that is required to make the marketplaces work.\xc2\xa0 That percent has already been cleared.\xc2\xa0 What we will see when the demographic breakdown comes in, we suspect, based on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from different states and anecdotally, is that there was a surge in enrollment among young adults.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">But we already know that that breakdown is sufficient to ensure that the marketplaces will effectively function, that issuers will feel comfortable with the demographics.\xc2\xa0 And as you also know, and as I mentioned yesterday, there are provisions within the law itself that ensure that the kind of spike in premiums that people might be concerned about, the fluctuations in prices because of the demographic breakdown of the risk pool are contained should they come about -- as was the case in Medicare Part D, by the way.</p>\n<p class="p2">So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see obviously what those percentages are.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the breakdown is.\xc2\xa0 But today we can say definitively that at midnight last night, I think fair to say we surpassed everyone\xe2\x80\x99s expectations, at least everyone in this room.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for that -- there are two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, the extraordinarily dedicated service of a lot of folks who worked hard on the effort to get the website functioning effectively, and that includes people in this building, beginning with the President, the Chief of Staff and others.\xc2\xa0 It includes folks at CMS; Jeff Zients who led a tech team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">It includes the efforts that everybody engaged in to, beginning in January, really, to conduct outreach to those populations in America who needed the information about the Affordable Care Act, and we got pretty creative in how we reached out to young Americans and others, different communities to make sure they got the information they needed.</p>\n<p class="p2">But most of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s because the American people -- despite everything they\xe2\x80\x99d heard, despite all the negative advertising, despite the obstacles that we put in their way with the crummy rollout of healthcare.gov -- made it clear that they wanted this product.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s important because the whole purpose of the law was to provide security through the benefits contained within the plans on offer all around the country.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the early problems with enrollment hurt some Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Are you advising them now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve reached this milestone to embrace the law?\xc2\xa0 What are you telling them?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to give political advice.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that despite the obstacles we saw, despite the lowered expectations that experts and others created, something important happened here, which is that the systems we put in place worked; the demand for the product was there; and most importantly, millions of Americans and their families are getting health care coverage.</p>\n<p class="p2">For those who voted to support that bill, that\'s something they should be proud of.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something they can tell their constituents that they did for them.\xc2\xa0 And they paid -- they took a lot of political heat in some cases and at some times over the past several years because of it, but they did the right thing.</p>\n<p class="p2">How every candidate runs his or her race is obviously up to each individual.\xc2\xa0 But what matters here is the policy, the law, the benefits that the American people, American families have -- the security of knowing that you have a preexisting condition or your child has asthma or any other condition that before the Affordable Care Act might have been the reason insurers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you coverage, that that can never happen again.\xc2\xa0 And that creates an enormous amount of comfort and security for American families across the country and that is a good thing.</p>\n<p class="p2">And this is just the first enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be many more for years to come.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Jonathan Pollard, since the briefing yesterday, U.S. officials have confirmed that there are talks underway to possibly release him.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why President Obama would consider that after for decades other Presidents have declined under pressure from the Israeli government?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President has not made a decision to release Jonathan Pollard.\xc2\xa0 Jonathan Pollard was convicted of espionage and he is serving his sentence.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, I don\'t have any other update to provide to you on Mr. Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s status.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously a lot of things happening in that arena, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of discussions that are underway.\xc2\xa0 What I will tell you is that the President has not made a decision to release Jonathan Pollard.</p>\n<p class="p2">Mark.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned insurers.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some concern among insurers of predictions of higher premiums.\xc2\xa0 I heard what you said about the premiums.\xc2\xa0 But if that is to happen, what is to prevent insurers from becoming villains in this story if, in fact, premiums rise and the popularity of the law takes a hit as a result?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what we know:\xc2\xa0 Premiums came in lower than expected, lower than projected for this year.\xc2\xa0 There is a process in place, state-by-state, involving state insurance commissioners, involving issuers, and then ultimately involving the federal government as it relates to the ACA that will produce premiums for the next year later this year.\xc2\xa0 What those premiums look like will depend on assessments that are made by issuers on the mix that they got in this first year under the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 A lot of actuarial work will be done to make those assessments.</p>\n<p class="p2">What we know, again, is that this year\xe2\x80\x99s premiums came in lower than projected.\xc2\xa0 What we know is that in the four years since the Affordable Care Act was passed and signed into law that the growth in health care costs has been slower than at any time in the past half-century, any time since these records have been kept.</p>\n<p class="p2">And what we know is that the law itself, if the mix isn\xe2\x80\x99t optimal, ensures that prices will stay affordable, through the reinsurance program, through the risk corridors program, and through the risk adjustment program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And Republican objections are a moveable feast here and I know that this is one of the ones that they are or will latch onto because their predictions of failure in the enrollment period have proven wrong.\xc2\xa0 But if they just read the law and understood that it contained these protections against prices becoming unaffordable, they would, A, recognize provisions that are similar to the ones that were in the Medicare Part D law that was passed under President George W. Bush -- some of them -- many of them -- were here and voted for it -- Republicans that is.\xc2\xa0 And they will know that those protections work.</p>\n<p class="p2">So that\'s what we know now as we head into the next stage, post the end of open enrollment in this period.\xc2\xa0 And we feel confident that the law is written effectively.\xc2\xa0 We feel confident, as I said earlier, that there is and will be a good mix, broadly, demographically, in the population of those who enrolled through the federal and state marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 And then there will be a process by which insurance companies, working with state insurance commissioners, reach and set their levels for premiums next year.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the politics of this, public opinion polls still show more Americans disapproving of the law than approving of it.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not in one poll I saw -- The Washington Post/ABC.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a number of states, opponents of Democrats are running against Democrats on their support for Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 To what do you attribute that persistent political opposition to Democrats about this law and the success that Republicans seem to have with this message over and over?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned in my topper, there have been millions and millions of dollars spent in attacks on the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 There has been a remarkable intensity and focus among Republicans, especially in the House here in Washington, on efforts to repeal the law -- a focus that has prevented them from, say, working effectively in a bipartisan way to help the economy grow faster, or create more jobs, or ensure that Americans who are working full-time and trying to feed their families are paid a living wage, just to name a few.\xc2\xa0 But you have to commend their singular focus, right, even if it comes to naught, which it has come to naught and will come to naught.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that this has been a political issue that\'s been a subject of a great amount of debate.\xc2\xa0 When it has been put to the voters, as it was after a presidential campaign in 2012, when this was the single most discussed policy item and on which there was the greatest disagreement between the two candidates, the President, who fought for and signed into law the Affordable Care Act, won reelection.\xc2\xa0 When it was brought to the Supreme Court, the law was upheld.\xc2\xa0 And now there are at least 7,040,000 Americans who have enrolled through the marketplaces for affordable, quality health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And those who run against it, who run on repeal and offer nothing in return but the old status quo, the status quo ante, are, I think, going to have some explaining to do to those millions of Americans who now have the security of affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We understand that every district is different, every state is different, midterms are obviously different from presidential election years.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is these are concrete benefits that millions of Americans now have.\xc2\xa0 And the 7 million doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count those who have insurance for the first time through the Medicaid expansion in those states where they didn\xe2\x80\x99t deny their citizens that benefit.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count I think the 3 million-plus young Americans, young adults who have been able to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans up to the age of 26.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re getting into real numbers and they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly real people with real benefits.\xc2\xa0 So politics will always be politics, but the substance of what the American people are getting here is real.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you sort of an off-topic question?\xc2\xa0 A book was published this week that drew attention to high-frequency trading, a practice through which people use legal methods and regulated markets to make billions of dollars by sort of taking advantage of the average investor.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that\xe2\x80\x99s fair?\xc2\xa0 And is there anything the White House or his administration can do about that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with the President about the book or the issue that the book has highlighted, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t characterize his thinking.\xc2\xa0 And on matters of sort of regulatory issues, I have to point you to those agencies that regulate the markets and the Department of Treasury and others -- Department of Justice if there\xe2\x80\x99s a legal issue.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a White House view on that at this time.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Jonathan Pollard, you said the President has not made a decision, but is his release under discussion in any way?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, the Israelis, of course, as you know, have frequently raised Jonathan Pollard in our discussions.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of discussions that Secretary Kerry has had and is having in the region.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President has not decided to release Jonathan Pollard, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a person who was convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on this status.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned about the perception -- obviously this is going to be said -- that you may be thinking about trading the release of a prisoner who was convicted of espionage in exchange for making some progress when it comes to Middle East peace?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First -- or repeat what I did say, which is that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well known that the Israelis frequently raise this issue and they have raised this issue in our discussions.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the work that Secretary Kerry is doing and the conversations that he\xe2\x80\x99s having.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s number one.</p>\n<p class="p3">Number two, the need for and benefits of a peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, a peace that provides the Palestinians with their own state and provides security to a democratic Jewish state of Israel, transcend this issue and many others that are part of the discussions that we have.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of both parties to try to find a path forward to reach a peace agreement.\xc2\xa0 There have been very difficult issues over the years that have prevented a peace agreement from being reached.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">It\xe2\x80\x99s not an accident that many American administrations have engaged in an effort to try to help bring the parties together and help them reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We are certainly actively engaged in that effort.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s never been easy; it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to get back to numbers -- you said over 7 million.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to the numbers, shall we?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to the numbers.\xc2\xa0 Won\xe2\x80\x99t you have to subtract the number of people who have not made that first payment on those premiums, who fail to make that payment, from this 7 million figure?\xc2\xa0 Not to be a stickler here, but you may not have hit 7 million, right?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, all I\xe2\x80\x99ve reported to you today is that as of midnight last night, enrollments surpassed 7 million, and that was not counting figures from states across the country who have their own marketplaces for that final day.\xc2\xa0 And all of these states, by and large, experienced similar surges.\xc2\xa0 So once those numbers come in, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more accurate total for the figure hit at the end of the open enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t account for those who began the process but weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to complete it because of the surge in volume.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be engaged with those individuals to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re able to complete their enrollments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.\xc2\xa0 So whatever that total figure ends up being, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to get you that information when we have it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">On the matter of payments, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just refer you to what I said before.\xc2\xa0 In this, there is no difference between the past and the present.\xc2\xa0 People purchase health insurance; they have a premium to pay and overwhelmingly they pay them on time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have, at some point, when we work with issuers and aggregate the data, some figures on what those percentages look like.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look anecdotally at what some major issuers have said, they look very much like they have in the past.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s something you can look at, certainly.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not calling apples -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not mixing apples and oranges; we\xe2\x80\x99re giving you the data we have.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d be disappointed, Jim, if you suggested that somehow 7 million wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in another life you certainly were a political analyst and you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked politics from that podium, so I just want to try one more time.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go for it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of these numbers, the success you\xe2\x80\x99re touting here, would it be a mistake for Democrats not to embrace the Affordable Care Act in the upcoming midterm elections?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, all I can say is that every district in every state is different, and every candidate and incumbent is different.\xc2\xa0 And each has to make --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just as a general principle, should Democrats be --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as a general principle, running on embracing --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- campaign strategy pointers from this podium, again, because it is also a fact and probably will continue to be a fact that folks out there who want to take those benefits away from the American people, have those people who were uninsured and then are now insured be uninsured again, who are happy putting the insurance companies back in charge of this process are going to spend -- have spent and will spend millions of dollars making their argument, often using false examples and false facts to make it.\xc2\xa0 So that makes it challenging.\xc2\xa0 It has been.\xc2\xa0 It was for the President.\xc2\xa0 It will be for candidates this fall.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So, again, I think every candidate, every incumbent will make his or her assessments on this.\xc2\xa0 But I think that what is incontrovertible is that what was predicted to be a failure has been a success when it comes to meeting the target set by independent experts.\xc2\xa0 And that has happened despite the fact that we basically lost two months because of the troubles with the website.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that members of Congress who supported this effort can point to when they have to talk about why they voted to provide quality, affordable health insurance to their constituents, and why the system despite its early troubles ended up working effectively for all those millions of Americans who wanted the product offered.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the numbers, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the -- I mean, after all, these exchanges were set up so that people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have health insurance could buy health insurance through a marketplace.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t the critical number here how many people were able to get insurance who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance before?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s what this is all about, right, providing insurance for the previously uninsured?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me refine what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about, if I may.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously about ensuring that everybody has access to quality and affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that includes those Americans and their families who are on the individual market and subject to the vagaries of the individual market.\xc2\xa0 It was one of the most -- one of the least regulated arenas within the broader health insurance market.\xc2\xa0 The kinds of minimum benefits that the Affordable Care Act puts in place in that market did not exist and you often had people who paid a very hefty price for a product that ended up not covering the very illness that they suffered, or would not extend coverage to their kid with a preexisting condition, or would charge your twin sister twice what they charged you.</p>\n<p class="p2">So the reform that the Affordable Care Act put in place, the reforms that it put into place were designed to address a lot of problems within this market that was broken and needed fixing.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been demonstrated that it is fixing many of those problems.</p>\n<p class="p2">On the issue of the overall percentage of uninsured, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some early data from public polling outfits and also from various other state and private agencies that suggest that the percentages of uninsured have been coming down as a result of the Affordable Care Act and people signing up and getting insurance through the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly one of the objects.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Overall, remember that the projections that were made by independent experts about the broader impact on the percentage of uninsured in the United States were projections over three years. So we\xe2\x80\x99re year one into a process that will lead to greater numbers of Americans who were uninsured getting insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that includes potentially, should the leaders of these states change their minds or be changed out themselves, further expansion of Medicaid into those states that haven\xe2\x80\x99t accepted the expansion offered in the Affordable Care Act, because that in and of itself will mean more and more millions of Americans who are uninsured getting insurance.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear, you still have no idea how many of these 7 million who have signed up previously had health insurance policies that were cancelled, many of them because of the Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, what I can tell you is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re aggregating a lot of data here.\xc2\xa0 What I just described to you is what the Affordable Care Act was designed to address -- the many problems in the system that it was designed to address, including the challenge of getting the uninsured insured.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question, as, for example, the percentage of Americans without insurance continues to fall, measuring 15.9 percent so far in 2014 compared with 17.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So the whole purpose of -- what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the conclusion of the first open enrollment period is progress on all fronts identified by the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And that is a good thing.</p>\n<p class="p3">Another point I made yesterday about trying to pinpoint at an individual level who was uninsured and is now insured, who would have been uninsured in a world without the ACA but is insured, is very difficult because every year in the past, people were losing their health insurance on the individual market as well as in the broader market.\xc2\xa0 And that was going to continue no matter what, and it actually accelerated over the past couple of decades.</p>\n<p class="p3">So what we know is that there were going to be people in 2014 who were uninsured, were going to be uninsured, absent the Affordable Care Act, who now have insurance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know precisely who those individuals were because they were able to sign up for quality, affordable health insurance through the marketplaces before they found out whether or not they were going to lose the insurance that they had.</p>\n<p class="p3">Alexis.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House may have described this earlier today, but could you repeat, how did the President get the total, the number, the actual tally?\xc2\xa0 And could you also describe -- like, did he call Secretary Sebelius, or will we see her this afternoon, to say thank you to the HHS staff, or whatever?\xc2\xa0 The color.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Old habits.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I used to beg for color.\xc2\xa0 So he was informed when -- I think we put out a photograph of this -- but some of the team here, members of the team here who have worked with great intensity on this issue briefed him I think before his PDB on the data that we had at that point, which was reflected in what I just told you.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- and he obviously saw, as we all did, with the surge and other sort of -- the increasing indicators that the numbers were going to be strong, so he knew yesterday that it was possible we could get to 7 million, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that hard figure until this morning.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d say that everybody in that picture is pretty happy about that result.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any phone calls that he\xe2\x80\x99s made to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously talk about this issue later today, so maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some color then.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up question on Jonathan Pollard.\xc2\xa0 In the past, Presidents who have been asked to weigh in on this, executive clemency questions, received the data, the request or the proposal in a formal way in which the intelligence community, the Justice Department and the State Department would have been able to weigh in.\xc2\xa0 Since you have said the President has made no decision that suggests that he\xe2\x80\x99s been asked to make this decision.\xc2\xa0 Could you describe how the process is underway here today?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the underlying activity that you just mentioned to describe to you.\xc2\xa0 And as a general matter, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say when these issues are raised, that kind of work is done.\xc2\xa0 But as I pointed out earlier, these issues are raised by the Israelis -- or this particular issue has been raised by the Israelis in our conversations for some time.\xc2\xa0 So what I can tell you is that the President has not decided to release Jonathan Pollard.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you, obviously, that he was convicted of espionage, and he is serving a sentence as a result of that conviction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But you were suggesting almost that it\xe2\x80\x99s a political equation, that this is entirely a political question.\xc2\xa0 This is part of the diplomatic discussion -- no?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m limiting what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying pretty clearly, so implications that you find in what I say aren\xe2\x80\x99t there.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for the words, actually.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking for you to say -- the President is weighing this?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that, as has been reported and I think is reasonably well known, the Israelis have frequently raised Jonathan Pollard in our discussions.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details of those discussions that Secretary Kerry is currently having and has been having in the region.</p>\n<p class="p3">On the specific issue of the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making process, I can report to you that the President has not decided to release Jonathan Pollard.\xc2\xa0 And I have no further update on his --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is it ruled out?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- you\xe2\x80\x99re engaging, like, rule in, rule out.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again and again when people ask me --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but you said you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s conversations.\xc2\xa0 That suggests it\xe2\x80\x99s on the table.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the Israelis have -- well, the Israelis raise this issue, as I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you now and has been reported.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re involved in conversations with the Israelis; they raise the issues of Jonathan Pollard.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to rule it out?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying the President has not made a decision to release Jonathan Pollard.</p>\n<p class="p3">Major.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just follow up on this -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all new for the Israelis to raise this, as you know and as every press secretary knows and every previous President knows.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual.\xc2\xa0 What is unusual, in our -- and sparked this curiosity, is that an administration is now willing to consider it in the context of negotiations over Middle East peace.\xc2\xa0 You said a few moments ago that the benefits of Middle East peace transcend this and other issues.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about is it appears that this is on the table not in the context of a deal but just prolonging negotiations in pursuit of a deal.\xc2\xa0 And for some, that seems like an awfully large U.S. concession just to keep talks going that are not guaranteed or even reliably predicted to succeed.\xc2\xa0 Why that change in emphasis and willing to put something of such value to the Israelis as Jonathan Pollard on the table just to keep talks going?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you always do, Major, you state things very well.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the Israelis have frequently raised Jonathan Pollard as an issue, and the President has not made a decision to release Jonathan Pollard.\xc2\xa0 I understand everything else you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, and obviously the Secretary has been engaged in fairly intensive discussions with both parties and others in the region for some time now.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to play in those vineyards right now because it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty complex set of issues and those conversations have to do with the broader goal of achieving a peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I listened to every word you said in response to Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question about those who were uninsured and those who now have coverage, so please don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat it because I really -- I was very attentive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I want you to respond to what -- something Madam Pelosi said, Madam Leader Pelosi said, that is not really a big issue whether they were insured or not before, that there\xe2\x80\x99s so many other things about the health care law that are important that that\xe2\x80\x99s really sort of a secondary issue.\xc2\xa0 When those of us who covered the issue at the time remember -- at least I remember -- that getting the uninsured covered, to my memory, was the biggest part of the Affordable Care Act and was its most important legislative, policy and political calling card.\xc2\xa0 Are you backing away from that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t it not a legitimate question to ask?\xc2\xa0 Yes, people were uninsured before, but if there\xe2\x80\x99s churn in 2013 and 2014 caused by Obamacare because people lost their individual market policies and then got insured, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a legitimate question?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I never suggested it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a legitimate question.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- judge its overall success.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Leader Pelosi is absolutely correct in saying, as I did, that the reforms that the Affordable Care Act put into place, made law, provide benefits that are not limited to making quality, affordable health insurance available to those who were previously uninsured.\xc2\xa0 That is included among the benefits that the reforms create.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is like the --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty major goal here.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that the goal of reducing the percentage of Americans who are uninsured is one that will be met over the course of more than one year.\xc2\xa0 And certainly no projection ever suggested that that population would be eliminated in one year.\xc2\xa0 None.\xc2\xa0 And no outside independent expert would have predicted that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And our efforts to reach that goal more quickly were severely hampered by Republican governors and state legislators who refused to expand Medicaid to their own constituents under a provision under the Affordable Care Act that made sure that the costs of that extension was borne by the bill and not by the states, substantially.\xc2\xa0 So they\'re denying coverage to uninsured residents of Texas and so many other states around the country for political reasons.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a mistake.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And we have seen, despite the objections, a steady increase in the number of states who have made the decision to expand Medicaid so that those vulnerable populations who would be covered because of the expansion are covered.\xc2\xa0 And that will improve the bottom line when it comes to reducing the number of uninsured and under-insured in the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- again, I would point you to probably coverage you did and maybe -- you and I go all back all the way to covering health care reform in the early \xe2\x80\x9890s -- the challenges of the insurance market that drive people from being insured to uninsured were growing with each passing year and each passing decade.\xc2\xa0 And what is incontrovertibly true is that every year the individual market churned people out from being insured into the uninsured population, separate and apart from anything that had to do with the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And that was going to happen and had been happening for some time and getting to be a greater and greater problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And on that market, prior to the Affordable Care Act, there were not minimum standards, minimum benefits that plans had to offer.\xc2\xa0 So what you have now is an environment where folks who get insurance on that individual market now can be assured that even the lowest-cost plans provide an extensive minimum level of benefits for them and their families, and they are quality and affordable plans.\xc2\xa0 And millions and millions of Americans and their families qualify for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and for those residents of those states where Medicaid has been expanded, there are lower-income Americans who now can get coverage through Medicaid who weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to before.</p>\n<p class="p2">But we\xe2\x80\x99re not at all dismissing the goal of reducing the percentage of uninsured in America.\xc2\xa0 That is a primary objective of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And the evidence we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress against that objective, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make progress.\xc2\xa0 And one way to make a lot more progress fast is for those governors and legislatures to decide that their constituents deserve the benefits that other Americans have gotten.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, since that\xe2\x80\x99s an objective, is the administration committed to releasing some sort of figure on what the net number is then at what Major was getting at?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is data that we have to aggregate and compile.\xc2\xa0 The open enrollment period ended at midnight -- right?.\xc2\xa0 We still are waiting on data from state exchanges from yesterday.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can we get it tomorrow?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reasonable timetable?\xc2\xa0 A month?\xc2\xa0 Two months?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would give you -- I would point you to CMS, who are the experts on compiling the data.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Again, on the question -- but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make clear on the question of uninsured versus insured, you have to look at aggregate data about percentages, because you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- there are individuals who would have been uninsured in 2014 but don\xe2\x80\x99t know it because of the ACA, right?\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to say that this person, person to person -- identify who is insured now that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been insured in the past because they never got uninsured because the Affordable Care Act was in place.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your point about the numbers and you can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly turn them around that quickly because they\xe2\x80\x99re coming in very quickly -- at the beginning of all of this when the website was having so much trouble, there were only hundreds or thousands of people signing up in the first month.\xc2\xa0 You were saying then, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to cherry pick the numbers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to put out the numbers monthly of the people who are signing up.\xc2\xa0 So now when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got record numbers of people coming into the website, how can you turn around these numbers within 24 hours and tell us with accuracy --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because our systems have gotten a lot better, which I think anybody who went on healthcare.gov in October and went on it in the last week can attest.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you know that it\xe2\x80\x99s an accurate number?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we got better and better at compiling and collecting the data.\xc2\xa0 Remember, in October and November, healthcare.gov was creating problems at the frontend and at the backend.\xc2\xa0 It created a lot of challenges for those who were trying to assess exactly how many people had enrolled successfully.\xc2\xa0 And we all here remember those challenging days in trying to explain what was happening and how the fixes were going to be implemented.</p>\n<p class="p2">And, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously offering initial data that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be refined as we get more information, and will be refined in the way that a lot of you have asked about when it comes to demographics and other breakdowns, as we\xe2\x80\x99re able to sort through the data.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The DNC Chairman was on with Chuck, I believe, yesterday or today and was asked to name one bill that she could support to fix the law.\xc2\xa0 And she said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of one. And there have been various Senate Democrats in particular who put out laws -- bills to say, look, let\xe2\x80\x99s fix the law.\xc2\xa0 There are some tweaks we want to make.\xc2\xa0 Do you think Democrats on the Hill are committed to actually improving the law where they see problems, or are they looking for political cover?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand the question.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they committed to actually coming up with legislation?\xc2\xa0 And is the President committed to working with them?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Democrats who supported -- voted for and who support the Affordable Care Act and its implementation are very much interested in making sure it works effectively, and have supported the President and HHS and CMS as they have made decisions administratively that have helped smooth the transition.\xc2\xa0 What we know -- I mean, I guess this gets at who wants to fix it, who wants to repeal it.\xc2\xa0 I remember getting a question I think yesterday insisting that Republicans had changed strategy and now were running on fixing the Affordable Care Act. And I had to scratch my head and wonder what the questioner was talking about.</p>\n<p class="p2">Fortunately, the Speaker of the House came to my assistance in announcing for everyone to hear that their primary objective legislatively remains repeal the Affordable Care Act, repeal of insurance for millions and millions of Americans -- far in excess of 7 million, because, of course, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include those on Medicaid in the expanded states, or those who were on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 policies because of the Affordable Care Act -- repeal of a law that forbids insurance companies from denying you coverage if you have a preexisting condition; repeal of a law that provides assistance to seniors in paying for their prescription drugs, provides free preventive services for Americans, millions of them, across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank the Speaker for that clarification.\xc2\xa0 I wish it were not so, but it seemed like some folks out here hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard.</p>\n<p class="p2">Chuck.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have more confidence in Kathleen Sebelius today than he did back in November?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has had and has confidence in his Secretary of Health and Human Services.\xc2\xa0 And I think that --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not wavered at all?\xc2\xa0 Because he has been -- he has not always, when given the opportunity to express confidence in her, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always done it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that.\xc2\xa0 And every time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m his spokesman -- I have made clear that the President has confidence in her.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is, Chuck, that those were hard days for a lot of folks who bore the responsibility of making the implementation of the Affordable Care Act a success.\xc2\xa0 But the response, to a person, was not to point fingers of blame, but to roll up their sleeves and get to work fixing the problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I think you and I and others have talked about what was unique about that challenge last year compared to other challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in this administration was the self-inflicted nature of it.\xc2\xa0 And that meant that we bore even greater responsibility to fix it and get it right on behalf of the millions of Americans who wanted quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Sebelius was at the front of the line getting to work to make sure those problems were fixed.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President did say he was going to look at possibly doing an after-action report now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he said, after -- is that still in the works?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re connecting that to an individual.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that obviously the President is very interested in effective performance, and what he has seen since those challenging days is an all-out effort at a very high level of professionalism to get it right.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say -- and I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it today -- but I have a lot of headlines that you guys wrote and spoke back then\xc2\xa0 -- including something about not enough people enrolled to fill the stadium at the University of Michigan, Chuck -- that certainly made it seem like we would never get to where we are today.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I\xe2\x80\x99m not faulting you guys at least too much for that doom and gloom, because those were obviously tough times.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at what we were saying in the run-up to October 1st about the markers that we needed to hit and what would happen over the course of the open enrollment period, if you set aside\xc2\xa0 -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s a big set-aside -- the fact that the website turned out not to function effectively for a substantial period of time at the outset, we hit all those markers, in terms of when there would be surges of enrollment, what we would be doing to reach out to various communities to try to get them the information they needed, and what our numbers would look like based on our agreement with the assessments of independent experts about what we could expect if everything functioned effectively.\xc2\xa0 And it turned out that even though it didn\xe2\x80\x99t as regards the website, we got where we were supposed to be.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given how big this moment is in the last 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Kathleen Sebelius anywhere.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s been on Twitter, but you guys haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought her out here. She\xe2\x80\x99s not done any TV interviews.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wanted this all to myself today.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, you say that, but in other moments when there are big -- there are the array of players -- she is the point person on health care, is she not?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the Secretary of the agency that handles --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point person -- we should not read anything into the fact that she has been --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not at all?\xc2\xa0 You guys have not put her out front and center at all --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a few hours.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for the last two weeks, three weeks, four weeks?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re obsessing on something that I promise you needs not obsession.</p>\n<p class="p2">Yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hoping to do lightning round, do you know how --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Me, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how many people are in the queue, who got in line --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a great question, and again, we\xe2\x80\x99re just a half a day or a little longer since the enrollment period closed.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re -- or not \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d not me personally, definitely -- and sifting through and reaching out to individuals who left their phone numbers, who started the process, weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to finish, and we don\'t have a figure on what that population looks like.</p>\n<p class="p2">But once we do, and once the work is fully underway to assist them in completing their enrollment process, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a better sense of, A, how many people we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about; and, B, what the timeframe is for getting that work done.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a great question.\xc2\xa0 We just don\'t have an answer yet.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have Medicaid numbers?\xc2\xa0 And that\'s in addition to the 7 million?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updated Medicaid numbers.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and we always introduce this caveat, the numbers that have been -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past that have been in addition to the enrollments on the marketplaces, the Medicaid numbers, are not disaggregated from those in the states where they\xe2\x80\x99ve qualified for Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 A significant portion of those have been newly qualified individuals under Medicaid because of the expansion, but that includes others also who are requalifying for Medicaid, for example.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But those figures through March 31st aren\xe2\x80\x99t available yet.\xc2\xa0 At least we don\'t have them.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the Michigan trip, why Michigan -- aside from having great basketball teams and all those things?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not that good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Not Final Four quality.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Careful, careful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I had them both in my Final Four, but -- no, I didn\'t, actually.\xc2\xa0 I had one of them.\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why Michigan?\xc2\xa0 Is it because there\xe2\x80\x99s a competitive Senate race?\xc2\xa0 Is it because they might have an initiative on the minimum wage?\xc2\xa0 Or does the President just like Michigan?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We love Michigan, everybody here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about the trip.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re focusing on economic issues associated with some of the things they\'re working on in Michigan.\xc2\xa0 And the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is a piece of an overall agenda the President has to expand security for the middle class, and through expanding security through, for example, making sure that people are insured, giving them more opportunity to expand -- well, giving them more opportunity to find the job that\'s right for them, that offers the best for their families.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I think that that\'s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past when it comes to the need to have mobility in the health insurance market.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that the Affordable Care Act provides and will help create greater dynamism in the labor market.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tommy.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions for you.\xc2\xa0 You were just saying that in order to judge the number of uninsured who are now insured you have to look at the aggregate.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to clarify, that Gallup poll that you cited, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true that in October when the ACA went into effect, the percentage was at 18 percent, and then that 15.9 percent you quoted is from earlier this month and would not include the surge in enrollment at the end?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that was data obviously that -- from that survey that predates the March surge.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m pointing to it not as holy writ, but just as an example of indicators that have shown progress in reducing the number of uninsured.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be other -- there will be other data that helps clarify the picture as we get more information.\xc2\xa0 But that was one -- you\xe2\x80\x99re right, that that doesn\'t -- my understanding is that that particular survey doesn\'t take into account the surge that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the enrollments in state and federal marketplaces in the last several weeks.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question is, for the past several days you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about how the press has covered the Affordable Care Act, and it\'s my observation that it\xe2\x80\x99s been sort of a series of negative narratives.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the sometimes deserved, like the rollout, but there were also those -- story after story on TV about people who were supposedly disadvantaged by the ACA and they turned out not to be true.\xc2\xa0 And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the 40 percent number.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that with this 7 million figure, which could end up being considerably more, do you think that this is going to be like a turning point, and maybe not with opponents of the law who are always going to find a reason not to like it, but with the way it gets covered?\xc2\xa0 Or will it just be the next -- and here are some indications of it now, like, how many that were uninsured -- do you think that this might be a turning point in the way that the press covers?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, would that it were so, but I would just say -- I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 The negative coverage that we saw in October and November was earned, and that\'s fair.\xc2\xa0 I think, having been a practitioner myself, that I understand that conflict is news, and good news is often not news.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a conflict here, though, and I think it merits coverage, which is that there are now many more than 7 million people in the United States who have quality, affordable health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act, and then there is an active constituency within one party that is making it their number-one priority to repeal those benefits from those millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a conflict, and it merits attention.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that just because we crossed this threshold that everything is going to be perfect on this issue.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be a lot of dedicated professionals working every day on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act going forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve crossed one milestone here, but there are many more to cross in the future.</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think that -- the only thing that can sometimes be frustrating I think to me personally is -- for example, I saw in a couple of major newspapers today reporting on yesterday that would suggest that it was one of the worst days that the Affordable Care Act ever had, when, in fact, it was very much the best day the Affordable Care Act ever had.\xc2\xa0 So I scratch my head over that.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, yes, there were some glitches in the website again because of the incredible volume.\xc2\xa0 And despite the glitches, which were fixed, we saw exponential increases in the traffic and the enrollments across the board.\xc2\xa0 So, you know -- but I get it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on making sure that the folks that have real stories to tell about the benefits and the security that this law has given them and will give them in the future are heard, and that those -- everybody here in Washington understands that this is about real people for whom health care is a vital concern.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a political football.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And that\'s why the President set out to do what he did.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why those members of Congress who were with him, and worked with him in crafting the legislation, and voted for it did what they did.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why, years from now, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look back and see a highly effective, functioning law that has created real change and progress in the way that Americans receive their health care.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q \xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have anything on Kerry having to cancel his trip?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that there have been some reports about what President Abbas and others have said and what their plans are, and I would just refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick clarification.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sure.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 3 million young adults that\'s from the HHS report\xc2\xa0 --\xc2\xa0 they\'re not part of the 7 million who signed up?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those are folks who were on their -- I think those are numbers related to --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s since \xe2\x80\x9910, right?\xc2\xa0 That goes back to \xe2\x80\x9910?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That provision of the ACA took effect --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but that number -- that 3 million number is over three years --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 You have to ask --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- rather than one year?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, you\xe2\x80\x99re not 25 forever, right?</p>\n<p class="p2">Or even 39 as it turns out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 Or 41.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s a figure related to young folks being able to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jessica, last one.\xc2\xa0 And then Zeke and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of here.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Foreign policy question for you.\xc2\xa0 On the DPRK, what does the White House make of this announcement that there\xe2\x80\x99s a maritime exclusive zone on both sides of the coast?\xc2\xa0 Some people are reading that as a sign that there could be another ballistic missile test.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said yesterday, actions taken by DPRK are dangerous and provocative, and their continued threats and provocations merely aggravate tensions in a region that\'s already tense and further the DPRK\xe2\x80\x99s isolation.\xc2\xa0 We remain steadfast in our commitment to the defense of our allies, and remain in close coordination with both the Republic of Korea and Japan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">There are laws on the books, if you will, regarding these matters.\xc2\xa0 And any nuclear tests or any ballistic missile launches would be significant violations of those laws on the books, and by that I mean U.N. Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 1718 and 1874.\xc2\xa0 So we call on the DPRK to comply with its international obligations, and to refrain from actions that threaten regional peace and security.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you read it as an advancement or a progression in any way, though?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously see in activity out of the regime in North Korea sort of ebbs and flows in these kind of provocative actions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not predicting where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed except to say that what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so far is provocative and dangerous.</p>\n<p class="p2">Zeke.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 ACA implementation obviously has taken up a lot of staff time here at the White House, a lot of resources, people brought in to deal specifically with this issue.\xc2\xa0 Now that the enrollment has closed, this is maybe the end of the President -- what he called in November his last campaign, the one final campaign.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any plans to shift their focus onto other issues, move on to whether it be back to minimum wage or some of the other issues, or back to the -- or is to the midterm elections?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s next for the White House?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a bunch of things I can say.\xc2\xa0 First of all, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not onto the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of business we can get done on a host of issues that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about, including raising the minimum wage, including investing in our infrastructure, including actions we can take with Congress and administratively to move the ball down the field when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s principal preoccupation, which is expanding opportunity, making sure that people who work hard and take responsibility for themselves and their families are adequately rewarded for that effort and have the opportunities that sort of define what it is to be an American and to be in America.</p>\n<p class="p3">It also includes the potentially historic accomplishment that would happen if the House of Representatives would follow the work that the Senate did and pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That would be great for our economy, great for our security, great for innovation in this country and for our businesses.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep focusing on.</p>\n<p class="p3">But we are not going to take our eye off the ACA ball.\xc2\xa0 We have, as I said earlier, crossed an important milestone here but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the finish line.\xc2\xa0 And fortunately for the security of the American people, that finish line is so far off in the distance you can\xe2\x80\x99t see it because this law is going to become very much a part of our lives, as people gain coverage through it and the benefits that it provides through it, and as we move on to another open enrollment period in November, as well as, before we even get to that, we make sure that those who were in line, essentially, both virtually and physically, to enroll before March 31st are shepherded through the process so that they get their coverage.\xc2\xa0 And then obviously we need to continue to build on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 So there are going to be a lot of people still working very hard on this effort after today.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when will you have the breakdown for race, gender, and age?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said earlier, April, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have demographic breakdowns when the numbers are crunched and it\xe2\x80\x99s all disaggregated.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a time for you.\xc2\xa0 CMS might have it, but it will take a little time to get it done.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it take a little time because it was optional on the race part to --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know in terms of when people filled out their signups -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 CMS would know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- obviously, the focus is on getting people enrolled and that was the effort.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of providing data, the focus was on getting that top-line number as quick as we could.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And now the work, as has been the case in previous -- at previous moments along the road here, people will work on getting the demographic data done.</p>\n<p class="p3">Thanks very much.</p>\n<p class="p3">END<br/>\n2:50 P.M.
