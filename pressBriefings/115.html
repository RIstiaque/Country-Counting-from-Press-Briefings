Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:08 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0Hope you had a good weekend. \xc2\xa0As you can see, I\'m delighted to be joined today by the chair and vice chair of the National Governors Association. \xc2\xa0To my left is Governor Herbert from the great state of Utah. \xc2\xa0To my right is Governor Terry McAuliffe from the Commonwealth of Virginia. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tActually, one of my first jobs in Washington, D.C. was actually as a spokesperson for Governor McAuliffe. \xc2\xa0We had the opportunity to travel across the country a lot. \xc2\xa0I think when we went to a lot of our events there weren\'t too many people that thought they were hearing from the future Governor of Virginia. \xc2\xa0But, to be fair, I think even fewer of them thought that you had brought the future White House Press Secretary with you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But, anyway, it\'s nice to see you here today. \xc2\xa0Glad you\'re here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ll turn it over to Governor Herbert first, and then we\'ll got to Governor McAuliffe, and then we\'ll open it up for your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tGovernor Herbert.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Well, thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0We\'re honored to be here with you all today. \xc2\xa0And as the chair of the National Governors Association, we\'ve just completed our Winter Conference, as we call it, here in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0And we had great participation from the governors. \xc2\xa0And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the vice chair, Terry McAuliffe that we\'ve had a successful meeting, now just completed, with the President and the Vice President and Cabinet members, and had an opportunity to have dialogue that\'s important I think for us to be able to, as states and as governors, to move our respective states forward and help contribute to the discussion here of policy in Washington, D.C. and to help America move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve had an opportunity, through the National Governors Association, as you know, as a bipartisan organization of states and governors from Republican and Democrat, and we have one independent -- maybe two independents, I think we found out today -- and again, the opportunity to discuss significant issues whether it\'s health care, whether it\'s homeland security, economic development, education. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe federal-state partnership in relations that we hope to foster and even improve has been a hot topic of discussion at this gathering. \xc2\xa0We believe as states that we really are the laboratories of democracy, that we, in fact, are having innovation and creativity that\'s taking place in solving people\xe2\x80\x99s problems, and thereby, improving people\xe2\x80\x99s lives. \xc2\xa0And so we want to make sure that we foster as a bipartisan organization the opportunity to work in concert, in a complementary fashion, with our Congress and certainly with the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s been our efforts. \xc2\xa0And I just would like to highlight as we are looking at states to see the successes that they are having. \xc2\xa0If you look at Mississippi, for example, is leading the way on criminal justice reform, doing some things to help with nonviolent offenders to address the underlying problems of their criminal behavior, which may be substance abuse, mental health problems -- and addressing those to help eliminate some of the criminal behavior and help them transform and transition back into society.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlabama has recently had remarkable progress on health care reform, where they\xe2\x80\x99re rewarding providers for quality health outcomes instead of just a traditional fee-for service. \xc2\xa0So we pay the doctors, but we want you to produce a better outcome for the same amount of money, rather than constantly fee-for-service where it\'s repetitive and becomes more expensive.</p>\n<p>\n\tNew York is partnering with industry to provide college courses and immediate career opportunities. \xc2\xa0They partner with IBM, for example, their P-TECH school in Manhattan, where people go to school there for five or six years, graduate not only with a high school diploma but with an associate degree, and then are given a job in the private sector. \xc2\xa0Again, their success ratio is great, and again, a new, innovative way to help educate particularly at-risk youth.</p>\n<p>\n\tGovernor McAuliffe, from the Commonwealth of Virginia, again, is doing some wonderfully good things on cybersecurity, kind of the new frontier that we in states are facing, as is the folks here in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0But as any good governor would, he\xe2\x80\x99s doing things that are important to his state, and he has more cybersecurity entrepreneurs and entities in Virginia than anyplace east of the Rocky Mountains. \xc2\xa0And again, that legislation is helping to protect individual\xe2\x80\x99s security and identity, as well as protecting the security. \xc2\xa0So, again, a great example of innovation taking place.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd let me just mention last, my own home state of Utah. \xc2\xa0Again, we are leading out in many areas. \xc2\xa0Our economy is healthy, and nine out of the last 12 months, our economy has led the nation, based on the Department of Labor statistics, of private growth creation in America today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s not lost on me why people call. \xc2\xa0That\'s the benefit of this organization, is we share best practices; we learn from each other.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the calls I\'ve received from many governors is how were you able to thread the needle when it came to LGBT rights and religious freedom rights in a very red, conservative state, a very religious state, and still be able to find resolution to that difficult issue. \xc2\xa0It was not easy, but we brought people together and we were able to, in fact, have success in protecting LGBT rights, but also religious rights in the state of Utah.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll just finish with that, saying if we can do that in Utah, we can do it across America; We can do it in our respective states. \xc2\xa0And we can hopefully have the states held up as examples of bipartisan collaboration effort where we find common sense really is the key issue, and get some things done. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our initiative this year, Governor McAuliffe and mine, is to highlight the successes of the states. \xc2\xa0We\'ll have a compilation at our summer meetings in Iowa, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll, in fact, highlight two or three of the great successes of all the states and our five territories, and show to the American public that the states really are laboratories of democracy. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re finding solutions to people\xe2\x80\x99s problems and improving people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re honored to be with you today, and thank you very much for attending. \xc2\xa0Turn the time over to my vice chair, Terry McAuliffe.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Governor Herbert, thank you. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an honor to be with you today. \xc2\xa0As you know, we just spent the last hour, hour and a half with the President of the United States, talking about the issues that are important to the governors. \xc2\xa0We all come from different backgrounds, we come from different political parties, but what unites us is we talked to the President about our issues of national security -- how do we keep our respective states -- make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re safe, keeping our communities safe; in addition, growing our economies. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President has been involved in since day one, since he became President of the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Virginia, our economy -- very strong today. \xc2\xa0I just announced 3,856,100 workers -- more than any time in our history. We just announced the largest budget surplus in Virginia history. We\xe2\x80\x99re strong. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re working together. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do want to thank the administration -- we had four great meetings here. \xc2\xa0We met with the team about six weeks ago to plan this meeting. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say on behalf of all the governors, thank the administration. \xc2\xa0They gave us, at the FBI the other day, a secure briefing, something we had not had before, on the issues of cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0We talked a lot with different administration officials about refugee settlement and other issues, and spent a tremendous amount of time on trade and those other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s been a very, very productive meeting, and I do want thank the administration. \xc2\xa0All of us governors are working together. \xc2\xa0We have one common goal -- how do we grow our economies; how do we keep our communities safe. \xc2\xa0That is not a partisan political issue, it\xe2\x80\x99s what we were elected to do as governors. \xc2\xa0We came to our respective jobs to get things done. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of kicking the can down the road. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have filibusters and other things that may go on in Washington. \xc2\xa0We have to make decisions every single day.</p>\n<p>\n\tGovernor Herbert and I have also met with the leadership of the House and the Senate to continually convey to them that inaction in Congress causes us tremendous problems. \xc2\xa0I do want to commend the Congress for pushing sequestration off for two years. I want to commend the Congress now for getting a bipartisan -- transportation so that we can now make decisions in our respective states going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we have to work together. \xc2\xa0We are in a global economy, as I mentioned to the President today, and we need to continue to work on these trade projects to grow and increase our economic activity in our respective states. \xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thank you, Governor. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move it around here. \xc2\xa0Gregory, you want to kick us off?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Governors. \xc2\xa0Governor McAuliffe, you just mentioned the refugee issue. \xc2\xa0That was a big issue for a lot of governors a few months ago. \xc2\xa0Has the communication improved? \xc2\xa0Are you satisfied with the vetting process? \xc2\xa0Are you satisfied with the information you\xe2\x80\x99re getting from DHS and from the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Well, they sent three administration officials over to meet with us the other day in a closed, governors-only session. \xc2\xa0Lot of issues were raised. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to have the dialogue, and they promised they would get back to us with additional information as we go forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tDifferent states -- and as Gary and I talked about -- we at the NGA have to take better responsibility as well. \xc2\xa0In Virginia, as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re very happy with how we are dealing with this issue. \xc2\xa0Once a refugee arrives in the Commonwealth of Virginia, working through our state employee with the federal funds, we know who\xe2\x80\x99s in our state. \xc2\xa0But I think other states are confused about the process to go through, so I think NGA, working with the administration, we can get everybody in a place that satisfies everyone.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0And let me just echo that, if I could, because part of the challenge we face is making sure we have the appropriate information and have the appropriate policy in place. We understand as governors one of our first responsibilities is the public safety of the people within the state that we represent. \xc2\xa0So I appreciate the fact the administration has provided opportunities for us to access better information, to help answer some questions and maybe find solutions to some misunderstandings and apprehensions that are out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe still have work to do. \xc2\xa0And so we have an opportunity I think to build upon what we learned this past weekend, and it resolves some of the questions and concerns we have when it comes to the public safety aspect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On that same subject, the President mentioned gun control today in his remarks, and I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re a day after another shooting rampage, something that\xe2\x80\x99s affected so many states. \xc2\xa0So how big a topic is that in the discussions? \xc2\xa0And do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s some appetite growing for change, and can we expect to see more among states in the next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0I can just speak to Virginia. \xc2\xa0As you probably have read, we, for the first time now in 23 years, just passed significant gun safety legislation. \xc2\xa0It was done in a bipartisan way. \xc2\xa0The two bills that were passed were two bills that I ran for governor on, making sure, number one, that we now have state police at every gun show in Virginia. \xc2\xa0Those that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a federal license, as you know, beforehand, were not allowed to do background checks. \xc2\xa0Now, everybody will have access to a background check who wants to get one at a gun show. \xc2\xa0We have many gun shows in Virginia.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, we have protective orders in Virginia. \xc2\xa0Under current law, if you are under a protective order, you cannot purchase a gun or transport a gun. \xc2\xa0We have changed the law there because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. \xc2\xa0You could go out and possess a gun, but if you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy one, you can\xe2\x80\x99t transport one, why should you possibly be able to possess one? \xc2\xa0We are changing that. \xc2\xa0It is now -- will be as soon as I sign the bill -- it\xe2\x80\x99s now passed -- it will be a class-six felony for you within 24 hours not to hand that weapon over. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have made progress. \xc2\xa0This is bipartisan. \xc2\xa0Every state is different. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s unique in Virginia. \xc2\xa0As you know, we are the home of the NRA. \xc2\xa0But this was worked out in a bipartisan way. \xc2\xa0And when I made this announcement I stood with Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd at the end of the day, I made the decision on this particular action, it keeps our communities safer. \xc2\xa0And I stood with the head of the state police, the head of our Sheriffs\xe2\x80\x99 and Chiefs of Police Associations, who stood with me to say the actions, Governor, that you are taking with the legislature, is going to make Virginia safer. \xc2\xa0It is a key, top issue for every governor in America.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said at the beginning of the briefing that Mississippi was a great example. \xc2\xa0What is the common thread among the states when it comes to criminal justice? \xc2\xa0And listening to what the President just said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a heart issue in a lot of ways, not just legislative. \xc2\xa0So how will states in the next year merge this before this President leaves office? \xc2\xa0And this is, I guess, is a legacy piece for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Well, from my perspective, states ought to be leading out. \xc2\xa0We ought not to be waiting for Washington, D.C. and Congress or the President to do things. \xc2\xa0We have our own unique situations as states.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Utah and I think other states, too -- we mentioned Mississippi -- we are leading out on criminal justice reform with the intent of understanding what is the underlying cause of the problem; what is causing the criminal element to occur and the crime to be a result?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we find that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things that are underlying that. \xc2\xa0And some of it has been substance abuse, alcohol abuse, mental health problems. \xc2\xa0And so we are trying to address by creating, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in Utah, mental health courts and drug courts. \xc2\xa0We have a significant campaign for eliminating underage drinking. \xc2\xa0We find that if people don\'t start drinking until they\'re adults, chances are they will not be abusing alcohol when they\'re adults.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also have not only education, but opportunities for them to, in fact, have learning and awareness of the health conditions. \xc2\xa0And so part of our curriculum in schools is part of this awareness for our young people so that they grow up with those good principles and values which will help lead to a productive life and get a good job.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, again, I think all states are addressing this in their own unique way. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s top of mind for most of the states, and we see the Congress now following. \xc2\xa0So I think in a collaborative effort we can, in fact, do better when it comes to, in fact, criminal justice reform and making lives better, to illuminate the \xe2\x80\x9counce of prevention worth a pound of cure\xe2\x80\x9d approach that the states are taking.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0And, April, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0I also want to address juvenile justice reform, something we\'re doing -- I just put in my budget, in Virginia. \xc2\xa0In Virginia, today we have two gigantic, concrete structures that should house mass murderers. \xc2\xa0Instead, they\'re housing 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve toured both facilities, proud to be the first governor to visit both facilities. \xc2\xa0We spend $186,000 on a juvenile who goes through the system; 80 percent of these juveniles are re-arrested in three years -- 80. \xc2\xa0You cannot tell me that this system is working. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I proposed to shut those facilities down, to have smaller centers closer to the communities, where we actually have workforce training inside so that when someone gets out, a juvenile, there is a skill there so they can move into the workforce, get them closer to their families. \xc2\xa0Because, clearly, as a governor, to spend that money and have 80 percent rearrested in three years, the system does not work.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to the Attorney General -- and I do want to thank the President, who had the Attorney General address us before the President came in today -- on how we can better collaborate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Governor, the President in his opening remarks to you mentioned Zika and fighting disease. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned about the funding issue there? \xc2\xa0Did he talk at all about plans to get that funding through? \xc2\xa0And are you working at all as governors to press Congress to pass it?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Well, again, states ought not to be waiting for Congress to act. \xc2\xa0Sometimes that\'s a long wait. \xc2\xa0And we understand the budgetary concerns and where does the money come from. \xc2\xa0But at least in Utah through our Department of Health, we understand the importance of the health, safety, and welfare of our population. \xc2\xa0So our Department of Health is already addressing the Zika issue and concern. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing is probably appropriating money out of our own legislative session. \xc2\xa0If we can do that with what comes out of Congress, with the Department of Health, but our own health department, headed up by Dr. Joe Minor, will be out there making sure that we have awareness and we are there to provide help as we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with other of these kinds of issues that have come from time to time. \xc2\xa0So as a state -- and I think most states are saying what can we do to get ready -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with the Congress, but we cannot wait and hope that something happens there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you frustrated about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think that, again, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard today from Sylvia Burwell and Health and Human Services, that they are acutely aware of the problem and are trying to push information out to the states, which will help us in our own responsibilities. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s always a matter of resources and money, and so that will be worked out. \xc2\xa0But I expect that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be ready. \xc2\xa0Again, the concern is this summer -- people are outdoors, and this certain type of mosquito, it seems to be centered in most of the southern part of our country. \xc2\xa0But again, states can\xe2\x80\x99t wait. \xc2\xa0We are a little more nimble, and we have a responsibility to be out there and protect the public safety and health.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kathleen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Governor Herbert, I wanted to ask you -- the President made a joke -- I think it was a joke -- when he opened his remarks, suggesting that the governors might be sort of sympathetic to his predicament on the Supreme Court nomination, that you, too, are responsible for nominating judges, maybe even in an election year. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you -- what you think of that issue as an executive.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you, as an executive who has now appointed more than half of the judges in the state of Utah on the state bench, I understand how significantly important that responsibility is. \xc2\xa0At the state level, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not talked about as much as it is on the federal level, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve appointed, of our five members of the [state] supreme court, three of them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the vetting process, getting good people to apply, and vetted appropriately, and put good people, men and women on the bench is a significantly important issue for governors. \xc2\xa0So we can relate to that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that was what he said. \xc2\xa0We can relate to the President on a lot of things. \xc2\xa0The executive branch of the states are very similar to the executive branch of the nation. \xc2\xa0We have frustration with our own legislative branch. \xc2\xa0He has frustration with his legislative branch -- the challenge of getting things done and how do you balance the budget and prioritize correctly. Those are concerns and situations that we can, in fact, relate to -- Democrats and Republicans alike.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place for the Supreme Court appointment, and I expect that process will go forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Angela.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Governor McAuliffe, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trade agenda. \xc2\xa0You mentioned it here. \xc2\xa0A year ago, you singled out the tobacco carve-out as a problem in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s changed in your thinking in the past year on that? \xc2\xa0And how do you expect the governors to work with the administration the rest of this year to try to get that passed?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been supportive of the trade package. \xc2\xa0When it was unveiled, I went on a conference call with Ambassador Froman and Secretary Pritzker. \xc2\xa0But with any proposed legislation, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be issues that we may have. \xc2\xa0We did have an issue with a Virginia-specific related company. \xc2\xa0We were not successful in negotiating what we wanted, but I have to look at the total package. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t always get everything I want, but I have been very supportive on the trade package.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m a governor; I have the deepest port on the entire East Coast. \xc2\xa0Right now, when the Post-Panamax ships come through the Panama Canal in June, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one port they can come to -- they can come to the port that we have in Norfolk. \xc2\xa0So trade is very important. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI was probably the most-traveled governor last year, internationally. \xc2\xa0I go where the customers are -- 95 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s customers live outside the United States of America; 81 percent of the economic growth over the next five years is projected to be outside the United States of America. \xc2\xa0We can\xe2\x80\x99t grow our economy unless we\xe2\x80\x99re doing trade and growing our international trade. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been supportive of this.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve just been to China twice, Japan, Korea, seven European nations. \xc2\xa0I just went to the Middle East, and January 2nd, I went to Cuba -- had some significant projects that we were able to announce in Cuba. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s how you grow your economy. \xc2\xa0And where I may have specific issues on parts of the legislation -- but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look at it in totality, and I support it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very supportive of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Can I just add. too -- states really are at the forefront when it comes to economic development. \xc2\xa0And clearly, as we now find ourselves in a global marketplace, international trade is of significant importance to the states. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m in a state that has taken advantage of that opportunity. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had international trade grow faster probably in Utah than any state in America over the last five or six years. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re uniquely suited for that. \xc2\xa0We speak 130 languages in Utah, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve very bilingual and speak the world\xe2\x80\x99s languages. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, we recognize, as Terry has mentioned, that 95 percent of the customers live outside the borders. \xc2\xa0Our own Senator, Orrin Hatch, has helped to lead the charge on this trade agreement. \xc2\xa0The devil is in the details. \xc2\xa0I expect that they\xe2\x80\x99ll work out some of those and resolves some of the differences and have compromise. \xc2\xa0But clearly, we need to have international trade opportunities for us to have a healthy economy here at home.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Governor Herbert, I wanted to hear your answer on the gun question. \xc2\xa0And did you agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s call this morning for more legislation, and do you think there is consensus among Republican governors on that issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0What I agree with is what Governor McAuliffe said, and that is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a state issue. \xc2\xa0And the states have different perspective. \xc2\xa0We have different cultures and different politics. \xc2\xa0We see it in the West a little bit different than some see it maybe in the East. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that being said, I certainly believe in background checks. \xc2\xa0We need to make sure that those people who probably are not fit to be carrying a gun or a weapon ought to be restricted where -- that\xe2\x80\x99s because of mental health concerns, background checks. \xc2\xa0We have a very significant concealed weapon permit process in the state of Utah, where those background checks can be received and done. \xc2\xa0We have reciprocity with about 31 other states with our concealed weapon permit that we have. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, we want to make sure that the bad guys don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to guns but the good guys do. \xc2\xa0And so it will be different. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ve not addressed as an issue with the NGA, and something maybe we should address. \xc2\xa0But I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll find there\xe2\x80\x99s significant differences in the different states. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re a very strong Second Amendment supporter in Utah.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Question for both of the Governors on infrastructure. \xc2\xa0We read the Economic Report today, and the advisers talked about the necessity for expanding infrastructure to put people to work in broad terms, but in particular men. \xc2\xa0The workforce participation for men has been on the decline for several decades. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re getting the support you need from the administration in terms of infrastructure expansion. \xc2\xa0And are you doing all you can do to enhance to expand your own infrastructure to put more people both in Utah and Virginia to work?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0In Virginia, I can tell you, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a much better place today because we finally have a transportation bill that will take us forward for the next five years. \xc2\xa0I was very vocal, very critical of the Congress\xe2\x80\x99s inability to be able to pass that particular piece of legislation because it was crippling to us at the state level. \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t build roads, you can\xe2\x80\x99t build for the future if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know funding is going to be there for successive years. \xc2\xa0Now we have that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust in Virginia, for those who live in northern Virginia, we have just had another historic agreement for the first time in 30 years -- we are widening lanes both inside and outside the Beltway. \xc2\xa0This has been a very tough issue for over 30 years. \xc2\xa0I negotiated it out in a bipartisan way. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve just announced we\xe2\x80\x99re adding eight lanes on 395 all the way up to the district line. \xc2\xa0Two miles south we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go on 95 to get around that problem we had at the Garrisonville exit. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re adding lanes on 64 from 295 in Richmond all the way to Hampton Roads. \xc2\xa0So we are turbocharging our infrastructure. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good question. \xc2\xa0We are just nipping at really what needs to be a much bigger, broader -- and we as a nation need to do so much more on infrastructure. \xc2\xa0Our roads, our rail, our electric utility, our electric grid in this country are in desperate shape. \xc2\xa0And we have bridges -- thousands and thousands of bridges that are structurally deficient. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress with the money we have today, but we need to do a lot more in this nation. \xc2\xa0And Congress needs to move swifter on this to give us the tools to rebuild the aging infrastructure in this country if you want us to compete on a global economy -- and our ports.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Let me just echo a little bit of what Terry has said. \xc2\xa0A good Republican, President Eisenhower, in the \xe2\x80\x9850s, had the wisdom of putting together the Interstate program, which has allowed us to connect the states an increase commerce opportunities, and enhance -- have a better economy because of that vision. \xc2\xa0The states are doing the same thing -- or should be doing the same thing at their own local levels. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s whether the chicken comes before the egg, I guess, on this thing. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to reflect the demands of the marketplace. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t build roads just because we think that\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of economic stimulus. \xc2\xa0We build roads because that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s needed in the demands of the marketplace for commerce. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a wise investment of the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 dollars because now you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a return that the marketplace wants. \xc2\xa0So we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to artificially stimulate by putting money in there just to build a road for building a road\xe2\x80\x99s sake. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of what does the market demand need. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve met with our business community -- I meet with our CEOs every quarter in different sectors of our economy. \xc2\xa0And one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s become loud and clear in a very fast-growing state like Utah -- which is about the fifth-fastest-growing state in America -- our infrastructure needs are becoming acute. \xc2\xa0So not only building capacity, but also maintaining what we already have in our roads and our bridges. \xc2\xa0And for Utah, another uniqueness is that we live in an arid state, so water is a big infrastructure need for us, too, to accommodate the demands of the marketplace.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo states are all unique in what we do. \xc2\xa0And we need to find the infrastructure needs we have and be proactive in doing that. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little reluctant to send all the money to Washington then have it sent back to me. \xc2\xa0Sometimes we get too many strings attached to it when it comes back that way, as opposed to just keeping the money at home and doing what we need to do with our infrastructure needs on a local level.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Let me just mention sequestration for a second, too, because this has caused Virginia a lot of problems. And I do want to thank Congress -- this was a piece of legislation that was so onerous that it would never pass. \xc2\xa0Well guess what -- it passed. \xc2\xa0And it has created such problems at the state level.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you, in Virginia we are the number-one recipient of Department of Defense dollars of all 50 states -- 27 military installations, the largest naval base in the world, the Pentagon, CIA, Quantico, Langley Air Force Base, Oceana -- all in Virginia. And the indecision that went around that and Congress\xe2\x80\x99s inability for several years to figure out what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do has been crippling to the northern Virginia economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tI commend the Congress -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed it off for two years. \xc2\xa0But you know as well as I do, the percent of the debt-to-GDP in two years, we are going to be right back in this situation. \xc2\xa0We have to begin to think long term. \xc2\xa0We need leadership decisions to grow our country so the economy can grow and everybody can benefit.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Hopefully, Governor, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find this a timely question. \xc2\xa0You have been the Democratic National Committee Campaign chair. \xc2\xa0You were the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \xc2\xa0You maintain a close relationship -- I think you know where I\xe2\x80\x99m going -- maintain a close --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Not sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. \xc2\xa0You maintain a close relationship with the Clintons. \xc2\xa0You ran Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in 2008. \xc2\xa0If Secretary Clinton becomes the nominee of her party in Philadelphia, would you consider, if she asked -- see, now you know where it\xe2\x80\x99s going -- would you consider, if asked, the spot of Vice President?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been friends with the Clintons a long time. \xc2\xa0I love them dearly. \xc2\xa0Honestly, I have the greatest job in the United States -- I am the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. \xc2\xa0So when you go all home tonight and you think about this -- Patrick Henry, our first governor -- \xe2\x80\x9cGive me liberty or give me death\xe2\x80\x9d -- our second governor, Thomas Jefferson, and now, Terry McAuliffe. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0How could you honestly ever -- and I have, as you know, two years to go, I\xe2\x80\x99m just warming up. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got our economy back. \xc2\xa0And let me say this -- we have two very qualified United States senators who I think would be spectacular on the ticket, as you know. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve never worked for anyone in my life -- I have been an entrepreneur my whole life. \xc2\xa0I love being Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. \xc2\xa0I can help people.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Let me just add to that, if I could, because -- (laughter) -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t need my endorsement, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, it won\xe2\x80\x99t help you. \xc2\xa0But he is the Governor of Virginia, which is a great position to be in, but he is going to be the chairman of the National Governors Association. \xc2\xa0Why would you want to take a step backwards? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good point. \xc2\xa0Thank you for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Terry, you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to say no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How are you, Governor? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Good. \xc2\xa0Good to see you again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Good to see you. \xc2\xa0On a related question, have you and your colleagues taken notice of how poorly governors have done in the campaign so far this year? \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s only one governor left in the race, and governors -- former governors have had to drop out. So what do you make of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Governor McAuliffe and I were not running -- (laughter) -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR MCAULIFFE: \xc2\xa0Yes, they would have changed it. \xc2\xa0You know, Mark, listen, every presidential season is different. \xc2\xa0I think this is a rather unique one, at least on the Republican side, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. \xc2\xa0You have very qualified people. \xc2\xa0I always -- I think being a governor is a great training ground to be President. \xc2\xa0You have to make executive decisions every single day; you cannot pass the buck. \xc2\xa0Every single day, Gary and I and the other governors, there\xe2\x80\x99s items on our desk, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make decisions that particular day. \xc2\xa0I think that is a great, great training ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut every election season has its own individual quirks in what comes up in it, and this one is a unique one. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0Let me just say, too, again, on the Republican side, it was going to be the year of the governors. \xc2\xa0We had so many that were running. \xc2\xa0And so it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of a surprise --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re almost all gone, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tGOVERNOR HERBERT: \xc2\xa0They almost are all gone. \xc2\xa0Governor Kasich is still hanging in there, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens. \xc2\xa0But, again, I think Governor McAuliffe has said it right. \xc2\xa0Every election cycle has its own kind of flavor and uniqueness, and this has been unique, certainly on the Republican side, what\xe2\x80\x99s taken place there. \xc2\xa0But I mean, I support governors. \xc2\xa0I think governors really do have the right training. \xc2\xa0And the American people, historically, have supported governors more often than anybody else, either. \xc2\xa0And, again, that training ground that you give us as a state executive helps you transition to the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0So who knows what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen. \xc2\xa0My crystal ball is as foggy as anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thank you very much, gentlemen. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a little excitement to kick off the briefing today, huh?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You let them go when -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He answered the question pretty directly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You had your chance. \xc2\xa0You asked about criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will. \xc2\xa0Other than that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have anything at the top so we can go straight to your questions. \xc2\xa0Kathleen, do you want to fire away first?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I wanted to start with the ceasefire in Syria. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has spoken with Vladimir Putin yet on that topic and if you have any readout from the call.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, President Obama did have an opportunity to telephone President Putin today. \xc2\xa0That call was placed at President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s request, and it was a call to discuss the ongoing conversations about arriving at an understanding around a cessation of hostilities in Syria. \xc2\xa0As announced in Munich a little over a week ago, this cessation of hostilities will apply to all parties in Syria except for ISIL, except for al-Nusra and other terrorist groups that have been so designated by the U.N. Security Council.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the coming days, the United States and our ISSG partners on the ceasefire taskforce will undertake a series of steps to implement the cessation of hostilities by February 27th. \xc2\xa0And we recognize -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure all of you do, as well -- that this is going to be difficult to implement. \xc2\xa0We know that there are a lot of obstacles and there are sure to be some setbacks. \xc2\xa0After all, for years, we have been trying to reach a diplomatic resolution to the many problems that plague that nation that has broken apart.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is a moment of opportunity, and it is the result of tenacious diplomacy on the part of Secretary Kerry, and we are going to continue to try to capitalize on this moment of opportunity. \xc2\xa0And we are hopeful that all the other signatories to the document will do the same thing. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll proceed from there.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, Secretary Kerry has put out a statement on this. I would anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit more of a formal readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s telephone call with President Putin later today. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of the situation as it stands now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And given how long you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this, as you mentioned, the fact that the President is not coming out to formally announce this deal, this major step, as you said, should we that as skepticism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think -- let me make a couple of observations. \xc2\xa0The first is that this is a moment of opportunity and it will require all of the parties who signed on to this document to follow through on the commitments that they have made. \xc2\xa0The whole world can see in writing what everyone has committed to. \xc2\xa0And it\'s time for the signatories to step up and for the bloodshed to come to an end. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would be quite surprised if there aren\'t some bumps along the road as we try to implement this agreement. \xc2\xa0There are going to be some obstacles that we\'re going to have to work through. \xc2\xa0There will likely be setbacks. \xc2\xa0But this is a moment of opportunity, and we are hopeful that all of the parties will capitalize on it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, the stakes here are high. \xc2\xa0There are millions of innocent lives in Syria that have been negatively affected by the ongoing chaos inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And this cessation of hostilities could provide an opportunity for a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is increasing the flow of badly needed humanitarian assistance in Syria. \xc2\xa0The cessation of hostilities is also envisioned as the first step in trying to -- I guess the next step -- in trying to advance the political track of the ongoing diplomatic discussions about bringing the kind of political change that\'s long overdue inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is the next step in what has been a long-running process. \xc2\xa0It is a moment of opportunity. \xc2\xa0And it a situation that the world will be watching most directly to evaluate whether or not those who have signed the agreement live up to the -- those who have signed the understanding live up to the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0If I could just change topics. \xc2\xa0Briefly, the President, last we saw last Friday, was carrying a big binder of names, apparently. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if you have any update on this weekend of research for the nomination -- has he reached out to any potential candidates --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any presidential conversations with potential candidates. \xc2\xa0The President did complete some additional telephone calls with members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate, including some who serve on the Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0So that is, again, continued evidence that the President takes quite seriously the responsibility that he has to consult with Congress in this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President also did spend some time, quite a bit of time, this weekend, reviewing the materials that were compiled by his legal team. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have an update for you in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s initial impressions here, but it is an indication that this process has begun.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he have any calls over the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have details about individual telephone calls. \xc2\xa0But I could describe them to you as both Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate, including some who serve on the Judiciary Committee.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, China says that what it is doing in the South China Sea is just like what the United States has done with its military in Hawaii. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Our response to this is actually quite direct. There is no other country that has a claim on Hawaii. \xc2\xa0But yet when you consider the land features in the South China Sea, there are a variety of overlapping territorial claims that a variety of countries have made on those features.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I recognize that the Chinese government may have a disagreement about the claims that are made by other countries. \xc2\xa0That\'s all the more reason that we believe that all of the parties should resolve their differences of opinion about this matter in a way that doesn\'t provoke a military confrontation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is why we have urged all parties who are claimants to these features -- the United States is not among them, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve encouraged all of the countries that do have claims to resolve them in a peaceful, legal manner, and to avoid confrontation and to seek to avoid escalating the tensions in that area of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe stakes for the United States are not insignificant. \xc2\xa0Again, we don\'t make claims on the features, but we certainly do want to ensure that the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce in the South China Sea is protected. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of commerce that flows through that part of the world, and it has a significant impact on the United States if that commerce is somehow disrupted. \xc2\xa0So that\'s why we\'re seeking to reduce tensions and encouraging all sides to come together to resolve their differences in a way that does not provoke a military confrontation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0And just to follow up on the Supreme Court, as well. \xc2\xa0Can you give us a flavor of what the President will be doing this week going forward about -- on the nominating process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I would expect that the President will continue to review material that\'s provided by his legal team. \xc2\xa0You guys had an opportunity to see how thick the binder was, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that he was able to go through all of the material that was provided by his team, but he was able to get through a good portion of it. \xc2\xa0And I would expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to receive material over the course of this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do anticipate that the President will place additional phone calls that will be consistent with his commitment to consult with members of the United States Congress about this nomination. \xc2\xa0Over the course of the week, hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to provide some greater clarity about who exactly the President has consulted with. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on that moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sarah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0A Pentagon spokesman said that the Guantanamo closure plan will be coming out tomorrow. \xc2\xa0I just wanted to hear if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything more you can tell us about that, if you\'re confident in the political palatability of it in Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not confident in that. \xc2\xa0In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many members of Congress express their opposition to considering the kinds of necessary steps to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0That political opposition stands in stark contrast to the best advice that the Commander-in-Chief receives from our military. \xc2\xa0It stands in stark contrast to the view of both Democratic and Republican national security experts, including officials who served in senior positions in the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t have a specific promise about the time frame for the plan. \xc2\xa0But the plan that is put forward is one you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to review. \xc2\xa0And it will make a compelling case that closing the prison is clearly in our national security interest, but also will reflect the need for the United States government to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is far too much money that is spent to operate that prison when there are more cost-effective alternatives available. And we certainly would like to work with the Congress to make those alternatives a reality because we know that those alternatives don\'t weaken our national security. \xc2\xa0In fact, they strengthen it. \xc2\xa0They enhance it. \xc2\xa0And it would take away -- by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay -- a chief recruiting tool that we know is used by terrorist organizations about the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given your pessimism about working -- that you just mentioned about working with Congress, would you say it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that the President will, indeed, take executive action to close it? \xc2\xa0And is the legal team, the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office looking for ways to do that inside the building?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My pessimism is rooted in the way that Congress has handled this issue over the last seven years. \xc2\xa0If there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for members of Congress to take a look at the plan with an open mind, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a compelling case to be made. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an open question about whether or not members of Congress are actually willing and able to do that. \xc2\xa0The President has said on a number of occasions that working with Congress to succeed in closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is the preferable outcome here. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hard at work on for seven years, and we certainly are committed over the course of this year to continuing to do that work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President walk out the door in 2017 with Guantanamo closed?</p>\n<p>\n\t(crosstalk)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be the case. \xc2\xa0There is an opportunity for Congress to step up and to work with the administration to do the right thing for our national security, to do the right thing for U.S. taxpayers and close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Is there a distinction between closing it and emptying it of detainees, from the administration\xe2\x80\x99s perspective?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, if there are no longer detainees that are housed in the prison then we certainly would close the prison. \xc2\xa0And the President does not believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in our national security interest to transfer any new individuals to the prison. There have not been any individuals that have been transferred to the prison since President Obama was elected. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, we have found more effective ways to bring a significant number of terrorists to justice, and in many cases, we have actually used Article III courts in the United States to bring individuals to justice, and there are convicted terrorists sitting in U.S. prisons right now, even as we speak. \xc2\xa0That does not pose an undue threat to our national security. \xc2\xa0In fact, it enhances our national security because it demonstrates that the United States of America is serious about abiding by our values but also taking the necessary steps to bring people to justice. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done on any number of occasions under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, and it\xe2\x80\x99s that spirit that is guiding his effort to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99re also making the argument it\xe2\x80\x99s an economic argument to close it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, a financial one, which is that there is a -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember off the top of my head the number -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s like $4 million a year per Gitmo detainee that is spent to keep those individuals at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. We could house those detainees in other facilities, including in the United States, that would be much more cost-effective. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are a variety of consequences for continuing to keep this policy in place that also drive up the cost. \xc2\xa0And this will certainly be part of the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making to the Congress about keeping the American people safe but also more effectively using taxpayer dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the latest number of detainees? \xc2\xa0And do you plan to announce this week another reduction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The current detainee population at Gitmo is 91. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that at the beginning of the administration, there were 242 detainees at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0So we made a lot of progress in reducing the prison population, but there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously some more work to be done here. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about any upcoming transfers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Just a couple more. \xc2\xa0On the High Court, is it possible that the President is in consultation with leaders on Capitol Hill because he is looking for a palatable potential nominee, someone that would be acceptable to them and acceptable to him? \xc2\xa0Is that the process that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, right now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from a number of Republicans that they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to consider anybody that the President puts forward. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned earlier, that makes it a little difficult to have a particularly detailed conversation about somebody that they are willing to accept when they basically have said that they won\xe2\x80\x99t accept anybody. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that underscores the unreasonable position that at least some Republicans in the Senate have taken. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent with their constitutional responsibility and it certainly is inconsistent with the American people\xe2\x80\x99s conception about what it means to do your job. \xc2\xa0And so I would say that there has not been a lot of detailed discussion at least with those members of Congress who have ruled out consideration of any nominee that the President puts forward. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in keeping the lines of communication open. \xc2\xa0And the President, in those conversations, has been pretty direct about the fact that he does intend to fulfill his constitutional duty, that he does intend to put someone forward, and he is urging members of Congress to fulfill their constitutional duty to give that person a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote. \xc2\xa0The President reiterated in those conversations his commitment to nominating somebody who has indisputable credentials and qualifications, and he is confident that the individual that he puts forward is somebody that can serve the United States of America with honor and distinction in a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, the kinds of conversations that the President has had over the last 72 hours or so are just the first conversations, and I certainly wouldn\'t rule out additional conversations. \xc2\xa0And those conversations would probably be more fruitful if there were members of Congress who are willing to move off their position of suggesting that they won\xe2\x80\x99t consider anyone.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0The Economic Report, a little glowing, I think. \xc2\xa0At least broadly speaking, they seem rather pleased with how the economy is going. \xc2\xa0And yet there seems to be a disconnect from a lot of voters who feel like the economy isn\xe2\x80\x99t working for them. \xc2\xa0Can you explain that disconnect? \xc2\xa0And do you accept the criticism that while there are a number of metrics that do point to an improving economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly improving for everyone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not the Economic Report of the President that indicates the strength and robust nature of the economy. \xc2\xa0I think you just heard from the Governor of Virginia and the Governor of Utah that they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty enthusiastic about the strength of the economy in their states, too. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of taking the White House\xe2\x80\x99s word for it. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a story to tell all across the country about the strength of our economy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think one of the reasons that there still is some work to be done is in the area of trying to put upward pressure on wages. Wages have not been growing as quickly as our economists would have expected. \xc2\xa0They certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t grown as quickly as the President would have hoped.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have seen, however, over the last six months a noticeable increase in the pace of wage growth -- that the wage growth over the course of the last six months is faster than at any time in the last seven or eight years. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a positive sign that wage growth may be increasing, and I think that certainly would address many of the concerns that are out there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other threat -- and this is detailed in the Economic Report to the President -- is that some of the economic weakness that we see with our trading partners overseas could have a longer-term impact on the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about that. \xc2\xa0These are companies with -- or these are countries overseas with whom we do a lot of business. \xc2\xa0And if they\xe2\x80\x99re not buying as much from the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an impact on our economy back here at home. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has eagerly advocated for a couple of things. \xc2\xa0One is a focus on those elements of our economy that we can control -- doing things like investing in education and job training to make sure that our workers have the skills they need to compete and win in a 21st century global economy. \xc2\xa0We also need to be looking for opportunities to deepen our economic relationships with those countries that are demonstrating some economic dynamism. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the benefits associated with the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement -- that many of the countries that are signatories to that agreement have some of the most dynamic economies in the world. \xc2\xa0So if we can deepen our relationship and improve our ability to do business in those countries, we can compensate for some weakness in some other countries. \xc2\xa0But, obviously, this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching closely in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tJessica.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Just a question on Brexit. \xc2\xa0Does the United States have a position on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the vote currently? \xc2\xa0And secondly, if the U.K. does leave Europe, is there concern about the impact on American businesses? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jessica, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware that Prime Minister Cameron has indicated that June 23rd will be the day that the British people have an opportunity to weigh in on their continued membership in the EU. \xc2\xa0As you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say before, and as the President himself has said, the United States benefits from having a strong UK in the European Union. \xc2\xa0And the European Union continues to be a critical global partner of the United States on a variety of issues, both economic but also some national security issues, too. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the EU Foreign Minister played a critically important role in completing the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0That kind of cooperation is valuable, and it\xe2\x80\x99s even more valuable to us when we have an outward-looking EU that has the UK as a member. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what the United States equities are, but obviously the British people will have an opportunity to weigh in here.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the Governors made reference earlier to a meeting they had a couple days ago when they were going over the Syrian refugee plan, and there were still obviously lingering concerns among some of the governors about the plan. \xc2\xa0Can you describe in any more detail what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts are to reassure them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Dave, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get you some more specific information on the meeting. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t attend it. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you that the administration is committed to doing is to working closely with governors and the non-governmental organizations in their states who are chiefly responsible for resettling refugees that are fleeing violence in other countries. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, refugees who enter the United States and enter any of our 50 states undergo the most rigorous screening of any individual that attempts to enter the United States that\xe2\x80\x99s not a citizen. \xc2\xa0And in many cases, this involves two years of work to take a look at somebody\xe2\x80\x99s background, to conduct in-person interviews, to collect biometric information to make sure that these individuals are vetted before they enter into the United States. \xc2\xa0And then, what often happens is they are paired up with faith-based organizations that have played a really important role in helping these new arrivals to the United States get their feet on the ground and get established in their community. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in some ways, this -- the President made a reference to this, actually, in his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, where he talked about this is some of the really important work that faith-based organizations across the country do every day. \xc2\xa0And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often get noticed, but it certainly contributes to the strength of our country. \xc2\xa0It certainly is the way that the United States lives up to the kinds of values that we advocate for around the world. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that the United States can be in a position to say that we actually take in more refugees to the United States through the established U.N. process than all the other countries in the world combined. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s just another way that the United States demonstrates our exceptionalism and the kind of values that make our country great.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Looking at the President\xe2\x80\x99s big binder before the weekend, it seemed like it might have been divided into nine sections or so. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Using a special, space-age lens we\xe2\x80\x99ve determined -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is quite a lens on that camera. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, actually it was kind of obvious. \xc2\xa0So would you say that that is an accurate representation of how many names might have been in there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s good detective work. \xc2\xa0What I would say is I would caution you against leaping to that conclusion, though, simply because I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to tell you that right now the President has a final list, so it certainly is possible that there are additional names that could be added to the list.<br/>\n\tI can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm for you that the list is at nine right now. \xc2\xa0I would just say that the President and his team are still evaluating potential candidates and that that work will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And is there a sort of time frame at which you would like to have a list that would then be narrowed down? \xc2\xa0I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a nominee potentially in a month from when this started, could we expect that you would have a list narrowed by this week or next week? \xc2\xa0Could you ballpark it then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set a time frame for it. \xc2\xa0As the President observed, there\xe2\x80\x99s ample time for us to get this done. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s still 11 months left in the President\xe2\x80\x99s term here, which should provide us ample time for the President to fulfill his constitutional responsibility, and ample time for the Congress to fulfill their constitutional responsibility, and to prevent something that is unprecedented in modern times, which is for a Supreme Court vacancy to linger and have an impact on two different Supreme Court terms.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo while there is plenty of time to do this work, the President and his team are moving expeditiously to nominate someone and put someone forward so that Congress can fulfill their responsibility. \xc2\xa0I think the reason that we have said that there\xe2\x80\x99s ample time is it means that this is not a process that has to be rushed. \xc2\xa0But I think everybody understands that there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of urgency in putting forward a nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And it seems like Republicans in the Senate are pretty hardline on not wanting to take this on right now. \xc2\xa0So do you expect the outreach to have an effect? \xc2\xa0I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the next step in that outreach? \xc2\xa0Are you going to have face-to-face meetings? \xc2\xa0Are people going to go to the Hill from the White House? \xc2\xa0And really, what\xe2\x80\x99s your expectation from those meetings, given the climate right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think the climate -- at least if you\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating the public comments of Republican senators, the climate is pretty murky. \xc2\xa0I think it depends not on the day you ask, but on the hour you ask, in terms of their openness to considering the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0And there certainly have been some very conservative -- self-described conservative Republicans who have indicated that they believe that Congress should do its job. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the goal of the consultation, again, is part of the President fulfilling his constitutional responsibility. \xc2\xa0The President is committed to engaging with Congress and he recognizes that it will be incumbent upon him to put forward a nominee that can be approved by a Republican Senate. \xc2\xa0The Republicans are in the majority. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re aware of that, believe me. \xc2\xa0The good news is that the two previous Supreme Court nominees that the President has put forward, even when Democrats were in the majority, they got Republican votes. \xc2\xa0Both Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan got Republican support. \xc2\xa0So it would be rather unusual, in fact, for the President to put forward somebody that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect Republicans could support.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say the thing that I said before. \xc2\xa0The Constitution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest that senators should only support someone that they themselves would have nominated. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not the process. \xc2\xa0The President of the United States nominates someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s role is to offer their advice and consent about whether or not that individual can serve honorably in a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, certainly Justices Sotomayor and Kagan are off to a good start in doing that. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the nominee that the President puts forward is somebody that could also fit that description.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, couple of questions about Asia. \xc2\xa0I wanted to follow up on Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s question on the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0The CSIS think tank has new images that seem to show a powerful radar being installed on one of the disputed islands in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0And this comes just a few days after evidence that China was maybe installing missiles on another set of islands in the same area. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration has done quite a bit, including last week, with the Southeast Asian nations, to send a signal to China to stop this -- and new partnerships with the Philippines \xc2\xa0-- has the administration concluded that China is just not listening to these warnings from the U.S.? \xc2\xa0And if so, would that mean that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take more dramatic steps than you already have, which has included even a sail-by by U.S. naval vessels in the past? \xc2\xa0I mean, is that something -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do something much stronger to get their attention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to evaluate the situation in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0And our hope is that tensions actually in that part of the world can be reduced, and they can be reduced if all of the claimants to the land features in the South China Sea make the same kind of commitment that we saw from the leaders of ASEAN in California just last week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the context of the summit, the leaders of ASEAN committed to not building up a military presence on those features that are the subject of competing claims. \xc2\xa0And that is a responsible way to resolve differences of opinion over those features, and we certainly would urge the Chinese and every other country that has a competing claim here to abide by that standard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You had the Chinese President here last fall. \xc2\xa0He stood in the Rose Garden and said they weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to militarize these islands. \xc2\xa0I mean, do you feel that you see any evidence of that pledge being abided by? \xc2\xa0Or do you see the opposite?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to evaluate these things sort of on a day-by-day or even week-by-week basis. \xc2\xa0But certainly, those kinds of comments that you heard from the Chinese leader are an indication that they are certainly giving this some thought. \xc2\xa0They\'re also well aware of the view that is expressed not just by the United States but by other countries in Southeast Asia, by their neighbors, ostensibly. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the United States is interested in continuing to try to facilitate the kind of de-escalation and diplomatic resolution of these differences that is clearly within the interests of everybody involved, but also clearly within the interests of the United States both from a national security perspective that you mentioned, but also in terms of the economic perspective that I discussed earlier. \xc2\xa0The South China Sea continues to be an area where a lot of commerce is shipped. \xc2\xa0And it would have an impact on the U.S. economy if that flow of commerce is disrupted by ongoing tensions in that part of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another topic in Asia, the Wall Street Journal reported last night and today that the United States had had some sort of level of discussion with North Korea through the U.N. about potentially reopening peace discussions. \xc2\xa0And in that story, it talked about one of the conditions would be that they would have to talk -- North Korea would have to sort of talk about the nuclear program as one of the conditions, but that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be mandated ahead of time that they would agree to dismantle the program. \xc2\xa0Would you comment on that? \xc2\xa0How serious were these discussions? \xc2\xa0And was that a shift in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s sort of thinking on North Korea? \xc2\xa0Did you feel that there was an opportunity there? \xc2\xa0Or was this sort of overblown?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I will say that -- let me just acknowledge I\xe2\x80\x99m probably going to talk about this a little bit more than I otherwise would have. \xc2\xa0You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that secret diplomatic discussions would be discussed publicly. \xc2\xa0But I will do so to help you understand that those discussions were entirely consistent with the longstanding policy that the Obama administration has put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was interest expressed by the North Koreans in discussing a peace treaty. \xc2\xa0We considered their proposal, but also made clear that denuclearization had to be part of any discussion. \xc2\xa0And the truth is the North Koreans rejected that response. \xc2\xa0So as long as there is an insistence on the part of the North Koreans to a nuclear stockpile, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very difficult for us to resolve our differences. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason for that is not just because of the preferences of the United States, the reason for that is because of the view expressed by our allies -- both South Korea and Japan -- but also because of the comments of people like the leader of China. \xc2\xa0President Xi made clear that the Chinese government would not tolerate a nuclearized Korean Peninsula; and that de-nuclearization is a goal shared not just by the United States and our allies, but by the players throughout the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on preserving their nuclear stockpile and attempting to develop it further is what has led to their extreme isolation. \xc2\xa0And their continued provocative actions including additional nuclear tests or additional launches to test missile technology will only lead to further steps that isolate them further. \xc2\xa0And that will include unilateral steps by the United States. You saw that the United States Congress has passed legislation to impose additional sanctions against North Korea. \xc2\xa0And there are ongoing discussions at the U.N. among the United States and China and other players in the region about imposing additional costs on the North Koreans for their continued provocative acts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell me is this initiated discussion by North Korea through the U.N. something that happened before in any way under this current leader, Kim Jong-un, and in a similar fashion in any way over the last two or three years? \xc2\xa0Or was this something that came out of the blue? \xc2\xa0What precipitated it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some additional information about what led to these talks, if anything. \xc2\xa0But that may be a little harder to describe to you, but let me take a look and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional information we can provide.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the President has said a couple times that he strongly doubts that Donald Trump will be President at this time next year. \xc2\xa0After South Carolina over the weekend, did the President have any further reaction to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President has pointedly avoided handicapping the Republican race. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make any predictions about who the Republican nominee may be. \xc2\xa0But he certainly stands by his conviction about Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s chances in a general election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he have any reaction to Jeb Bush dropping out of the race at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also, just going back to the Supreme Court nominees and just working through the binder, I know you can\'t really talk about the number -- nine to 10, or however close we are -- but can you characterize at least that the slate of potential candidates -- what sort of positions they hold, whether they\'re senators, any lawmakers, elected officials, judges, Vice President, anything like that? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\'s a good question. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a risky proposition for me to begin to describe even generally the kinds of qualifications of individuals that the President may be considering just because we want to try to protect the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make this process without -- at least without undue public influence. \xc2\xa0But certainly the President will be mindful of the promise that he has made to appoint somebody with indisputable qualifications, and somebody who he continues to be confident can serve the American people at the Supreme Court with distinction. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the one thing I would say is this, is that there are a variety of ways that you can demonstrate that capacity, and it doesn\'t necessarily mean being a judge. \xc2\xa0And again, that was true with Justice Kagan, somebody who had represented the American people before the Supreme Court as Solicitor General. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99d also worked in academia and also worked in the Clinton administration. \xc2\xa0So she demonstrated a variety of skills that made clear she is somebody who has and will continue to serve with distinction on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And she did that without having a track record as a judge. \xc2\xa0Now, Justice Sotomayor obviously had a different set of qualifications. \xc2\xa0And in some ways it\xe2\x80\x99s because of her distinguished service on the bench that she was able to demonstrate that she\xe2\x80\x99d be a good Supreme Court Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to describe to you exactly what kind of experience the President is looking for, because the President believes that there are a variety of experiences that you can bring to this job that would demonstrate your capacity to serve the American people with distinction on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it fair, though, then to say that this potential slate does include people that are not part of the judicial branch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize any further the people who may be under consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Just following up on that, has the fact that Republicans that they might not even consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee shaped his deliberations so far, or his team\xe2\x80\x99s, in terms of who they\'re thinking about would be an appropriate nominee? \xc2\xa0That is to say, if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that this person won\xe2\x80\x99t even be considered, let alone confirmed, does that then affect his thinking about who he should nominate?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t thus far and I don\'t expect that it will. \xc2\xa0I think the President believes that he has a responsibility, a constitutional duty to appoint the best person in the United States for the job. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99ll cast a wide net. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll consider individuals with a range of experiences. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, he is focused on setting aside politics, focusing on his responsibility, and appointing the best person for the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'re hopeful that in this way the President can lead by example, and that Congress will do the same -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ll find the courage to set aside politics, to focus on their constitutional responsibility, and give this individual a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So even if that means putting forth someone who might sort of languish out there for weeks or months or maybe until next year?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, ultimately, that will be up to the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility is to nominate the best person for the job, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then just one more on Syria. \xc2\xa0Last week the outgoing foreign minister of France criticized the President pretty harshly for making the red lines comment and then not going through with airstrikes in 2013. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously faced a lot of criticism both here and abroad about his approach to Syria and ambiguity there. \xc2\xa0I guess the accusation is that it has harmed American credibility, and now we\'re in a position in Syria where there are no good options and we don\'t have any credibility left. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how you respond to that, how you think the President sees that, and whether that is having -- playing a role here in the situation we find ourselves in now where, you said before, you\'re sort of crossing your fingers that this cessation of hostilities understanding is going to go forward, but you understand that there is a big risk that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to be implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, anybody who suggested that there were good options in 2013, or even 2011, for that matter, when it came to resolving the situation inside of Syria I think may not be well acquainted with history. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is that the situation in Syria has been very difficult from the get-go. \xc2\xa0And what the President has done is to assert American leadership in a way that has enhanced our national security. \xc2\xa0After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President who built and is now leading a 66-member coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0That includes taking military action against leading ISIL targets in Syria. \xc2\xa0When it comes to the diplomatic track and arriving at the kind of political solution that everyone says will be necessary to resolve the situation inside of Syria, it\xe2\x80\x99s the perseverance and tenacity of the American Secretary of State who continues to push for the kind of opportunity that has now materialized. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think at every step of the way, you see the United States leading the effort to try to solve what everybody acknowledges is an unwieldy problem with tragic global consequences. \xc2\xa0That\'s the expectation that people in the United States and around the world have for the President of the United States, and those are expectations that this President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just met, he\xe2\x80\x99s exceeded them.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Question on two other issues. \xc2\xa0One, I was in South Carolina over the weekend, and I heard people say --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Just for vacation? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, professionally. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Oh, okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was something called the presidential contest down there. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Yes, so many of the people that I happen to encounter happen to be African American. \xc2\xa0They were still saying, we\'re fired up and ready to go -- something President Obama used, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ballot this time. \xc2\xa0What is his hope for South Carolina and other states that really showed up for him when it comes to the black vote? \xc2\xa0Because that\'s going to be the first state that really has a pressing black vote in this election cycle.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the fired up to go --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Fired up, ready to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Fired up ready to go phrase is one that the President heard for the first time in South Carolina when he was campaigning there in 2007, and it became a rallying cry for his supporters throughout the campaign and even during his reelection campaign. \xc2\xa0And I think that is a testament to the impact that the people of South Carolina had on this President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign back in 2008. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThose of us who were there on the night of the 2008 primary -- it was in late January during that cycle -- that was a historic night, and it felt like a big night -- that you saw significant turnout from African American voters, and you saw an African American candidate get unexpected support from white voters in South Carolina, even though he was running against then-Senator Clinton, who obviously had a deep history in that state. \xc2\xa0And people often forget that the other candidate in that race at the time who loomed large was actually born in the state of South Carolina. \xc2\xa0John Edwards talked a lot about how his ties to that state dated back to his birth. \xc2\xa0And even in that environment, and even in that crowded field, the fact that President Obama could perform so well there made the primary victory in South Carolina in January of 2008 a memorable night.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the reasons that the Democratic National Committee continues to support having the South Carolina primary early in the process is it is an opportunity for the diversity of the Democratic electorate to be on display; that certainly the first two states, in Iowa and New Hampshire, even on the Democratic side are overwhelmingly populated by white voters, but, including Nevada, you get a significant segment of Hispanic voters, and then obviously in South Carolina you have a large group of African American voters. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a way that the DNC can demonstrate a commitment to giving the wide variety of voices in the Democratic Party an early opportunity to weigh in on who the Democratic nominee should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is an important part of the process, and obviously, Saturday I think will be a similarly important night for the two Democratic candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How is he getting the results? \xc2\xa0I mean, the race is tight, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s not as interested in this one as he was in his own, but how is he getting his results? \xc2\xa0How is he getting the results in this? \xc2\xa0How is he following it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President is following the coverage just like all of you are. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of coverage to see -- all of you are dedicating significant resources to covering that race -- and the President has benefitted from that in the way the rest of us have.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s also not unusual for the President to have other conversations -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with David Simas, his political director, or I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that even the President might have had a couple of political discussions last night when he was dining with the governors here at the White House. \xc2\xa0This is a race that has a lot of interest among people who are interested in politics, and the President has variety of opportunities to have those kinds of discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0And lastly, since our colleague is so great in using a microscopic lens to find those nine tabs, is there diversity amongst those tabs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the group of individuals that the President is considering, but he did direct his team to cast a wide net. \xc2\xa0He wants to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re choosing the very best person in America to fill this job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a woman in there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the list, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re casting that wide of a net, it seems hard to imagine that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a woman included.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a minority in there, since the net is broad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stop there. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wide net. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAngela.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted to try to clarify your answer to Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s question on the Gitmo plan. \xc2\xa0Is that coming tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know the Department of Defense has said that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you in terms of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any guidance to share with you in terms of timing. \xc2\xa0But obviously, the Department of Defense has been working on this plan. \xc2\xa0They are trying to beat a congressional deadline that\xe2\x80\x99s in place for tomorrow, so -- but they can give you the best assessment of when to expect that plan. \xc2\xa0The thing that I will tell you is that when that plan is presented to Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that all of you have an opportunity to see it as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will we hear the President talk about it at all in his own words?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say exactly what kinds of comments the President will have when the plan is presented, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And a new topic for today -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a speech earlier today that he is \xe2\x80\x9csympathetic\xe2\x80\x9d -- I think those were his words -- with Apple\xe2\x80\x99s position on whether to allow access to the San Bernardino terrorist\xe2\x80\x99s phone. \xc2\xa0The President obviously has spent a lot of time courting Silicon Valley in trying to get them to work with the administration on security issues. \xc2\xa0Now, to have a second company lining up on the other side of the FBI at the moment, is that a concern? \xc2\xa0Is the President trying to do -- want to try to do more on that front?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what our \xc2\xa0-- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been quite clear about what our position is here. \xc2\xa0The administration believes -- and the President has said this personally -- the administration believes the American people benefit from robust encryption that protects their privacy and civil liberties, that, as a policy question, that is a protection that\xe2\x80\x99s worth supporting. \xc2\xa0At the same time, our law enforcement and national security professionals have an obligation to keep us safe and to do what they can to keep us safe. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in this situation, as it relates to the phone that was used by the terrorist in San Bernardino, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a phone that was owned not by the terrorist, but by the local government. \xc2\xa0The terrorist is no longer living. \xc2\xa0And the need to extract as much information as possible to learn as much as we can about that incident is something that our law enforcement officials have concluded is a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as they carry out this ongoing, independent investigation into this terrorist act, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do everything they can to keep the American people safe, and learn as much as they can about this incident and this individual to keep us safe. \xc2\xa0However, they\xe2\x80\x99re also going to follow standard procedure and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to follow the law. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s how this ended up in the courts in the first place. \xc2\xa0And it is a judge who evaluated the arguments that were made by Apple and evaluated the arguments that were made by the FBI, and came down in favor of our law enforcement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, Director Comey I think said this pretty eloquently in a blog that he posted overnight -- that the case that we\xe2\x80\x99re making is not that the FBI should determine what access they should have to that information, but it also shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a private sector company that\xe2\x80\x99s trying to sell stuff that decides that question. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we have courts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we have a process. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we have an opportunity for both sides to weigh in in front of a judge to advocate for one side or another.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about this is that the request that the FBI has put forward is one that is quite limited in scope. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require Apple to redesign a product or to create some sort of new backdoor. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why it is an effective way for the FBI to follow their regular procedure as they conduct this independent investigation, but also stay true to the kinds of principles that the President has discussed publicly about the need for robust encryption methods.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given that he just sent a whole bunch of top administration officials to Silicon Valley to meet with these companies and ask for their help in general around this specific case, is the President frustrated that that\xe2\x80\x99s not turning out the way he probably hoped it would at this moment in this case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this difference of opinion is particularly surprising to anybody who has been covering this issue. \xc2\xa0I think what we are going to continue to try to do -- and the goal of the meeting, by the way, was one that was focused on trying to ensure more effective cooperation and coordination between social media companies and law enforcement. \xc2\xa0It didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily focus on encryption. \xc2\xa0There are plenty of other things that social media companies and technology companies can do that don\xe2\x80\x99t undermine in any way, even based on their definition, anybody\xe2\x80\x99s privacy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are things like being aware of particular social media platforms that are used to try to recruit potential terrorists. \xc2\xa0Those technology companies have no interest in their tools being used to recruit terrorists that harm or kill innocent people. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an area where we certainly can find common ground with technology companies, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with them to do that. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just one example. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a template that was followed by law enforcement and technology companies when trying to fight child pornography. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to try to find some common ground and work together in a way that enhances the safety and security not just of the customers of technology companies but of the American citizens that rightfully expect that their law enforcement professionals are protecting them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly on this, Apple has suggested that it would a good idea to have a congressional group, committee, whatever, take a look at privacy issues when it comes to access to phones like this. \xc2\xa0Does the White House think that kicking it to Congress to evaluate would be a good idea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a clear description of what exactly they have in mind. \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just sort of make the observation that I have made in a variety of other settings -- that sending complicated things to Congress is often not the surest way to get a quick answer. \xc2\xa0In fact, even asking some of the most basic questions of Congress sometimes does not ensure a quick answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s also a responsibility that Congress has here to weigh in and to help the American people protect themselves from cyber threats. \xc2\xa0The President included in his budget a substantial investment in upgrading cybersecurity not just of the government but also for the private sector and for individual citizens. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, we saw the Republicans in Congress refuse to even discuss that budget proposal with the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget director. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Apple would receive the same kind of reception on Capitol Hill, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear indication that Congress is not particularly interested in discussing that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tFelicia, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0Recently released emails show Hillary Clinton appeared to be directly involved in the State Department in selecting -- or trying to select the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary General. \xc2\xa0Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House put forward the candidate that she and her staff had picked out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those specific emails. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that the appointment of independent inspectors general is something that this administration has taken quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at the State Department that they have an Office of the Inspector General that\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty robust and been pretty prolific in terms of making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking out for the interests of the American people and the American taxpayers, and that they\xe2\x80\x99re providing an independent assessment of that. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have information about that personnel search.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just more generally, does the White House think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate that a department head weigh in on the selection of its inspector general? \xc2\xa0Is that a common practice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I can\xe2\x80\x99t really speak to how that process usually works. \xc2\xa0I think the first thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is it sounds like, based on just what you\xe2\x80\x99ve told me, that the individual that she weighed in in support of is not the person that was selected. \xc2\xa0Even if it had been, the person would only have been selected by the administration and appointed by the President if there was strong confidence that that individual could effectively do their work independent of the agency, and certainly independent of any sort of outside influence. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a requirement for the job, and that certainly has been a requirement for the job as the President has worked to appoint people to fill those kinds of positions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, one thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Go ahead, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Putin phone call was this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, it occurred this morning. \xc2\xa0And, again, that was a call that was placed at President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s request, and it was to discuss this arrangement that\xe2\x80\x99s been finalized for a cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know how long it lasted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long it lasted, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you that information.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Any chance of another binder photo op today? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you on standby.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:35 P.M.
