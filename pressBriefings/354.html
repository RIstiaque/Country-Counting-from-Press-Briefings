Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:04 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 Sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re running a little behind today.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>Nedra, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that North Korea is behind the hack at Sony Pictures?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nedra, this is a matter that is still under investigation both by the FBI and the National Security Division of the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I, for I think pretty obvious reasons, am not going to get ahead of that investigation or any announcements that they may make about that investigation.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that, consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s previous statements about how we will protect against, monitor, and respond to cyber incidents, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s being treated as a serious national security matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is evidence to indicate that we have seen destructive activity with malicious intent that was initiated by a sophisticated actor.\xc2\xa0 And it is being treated by those investigative agencies, both at the FBI and the Department of Justice, as seriously as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 It has also been the subject of a number of daily meetings that have been convened here at the White House that have been led by both the President\xe2\x80\x99s Homeland Security Advisor and occasionally by his cyber coordinator.\xc2\xa0 This includes senior members of our intelligence community and homeland security officials, military, diplomatic, and law enforcement officials as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the United States going to do about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, before we start publicly speculating about a response, it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate that we allow the investigation to move forward.\xc2\xa0 I do understand that the investigation is progressing, and that as the members of the national security team meet to discuss this matter, they are considering a range of options.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As they do so, though, they\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the need for a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, as we would be in any scenario, sort of strategic scenario like this, they would be mindful of the fact that we need a proportional response, and also mindful of the fact that sophisticated actors, when they carry out actions like this, are oftentimes -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not always but often seeking to provoke a response from the United States of America. They may believe that a response from us in one fashion or another would be advantageous so them.\xc2\xa0 And so we want to be mindful of that, too.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team is mindful of those two important strategic considerations as they consider a range of available responses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a big debate over Sony cancelling \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What has the President said?\xc2\xa0 Or is he expressing opinion about a movie that depicts the assassination of a sitting head of state?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t talked to him about that.\xc2\xa0 What I can say as a general matter is that the President and the administration stands squarely on the side of the artists and other private citizens who seek to freely express their views.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes those views can be laced with criticism, or are sometimes intended to provoke either some kind of comedic response or one that is intended to be some element of some pretty biting social commentary.\xc2\xa0 All that is appropriate and well within the rights of private citizens to express their views.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President has certainly been on the receiving end of some expressions like that.\xc2\xa0 And while we may not agree with the content of every single thing that is produced, we certainly stand squarely on the side of the right of private individuals to express themselves.\xc2\xa0 And that is a view that is strongly held by this administration, as it has been throughout the history of our country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then quickly on one other matter.\xc2\xa0 The EU announced a ban on businesses doing investments in Crimea today.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States planning to take similar action?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us an update on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to sign the Russia sanctions bill -- and also NDAA while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it?</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me first begin with the Russia sanctions bill as it relates to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The President does intend to sign H.R. 5859 into law.\xc2\xa0 Signing the legislations does not, however, signal a change in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions policy, which we have carefully calibrated in accordance with developments on the ground and coordinated with our allies and partners, principally in Europe.</p>\n<p>At this time, the administration does not intend to impose sanctions under this law, but the act gives the administration additional authorities that could be utilized if circumstances warrant it.\xc2\xa0 This administration will continue to work closely with allies and partners in Europe and internationally to respond to developments in Ukraine, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to review and calibrate our sanctions to respond to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions.</p>\n<p>The United States again calls on Russia to end its occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea, cease support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, and implement the obligations that it signed up to commit to under the Minsk Agreements.\xc2\xa0 As the President has said many times, our goal is to promote a diplomatic solution that provides a lasting resolution to the conflict, and helps promote growth and stability in Ukraine and regionally, including in Russia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn this context, the United States continues to call on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s leadership to implement the Minsk Agreements and to reach a lasting and comprehensive resolution to the conflict which respects Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territory integrity.\xc2\xa0 The United States, if Russia acts accordingly, remains prepared to roll back sanctions should Russia take the necessary steps.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update at this point as it related to the NDAA bill.\xc2\xa0 The President does intend to sign it.\xc2\xa0 It does include some riders that we have expressed concern about in the past that interfere with the administration to carry out the necessary steps to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 The President has long believed that that prison should be closed. But there are important pieces of this legislation that, in our view, inappropriately interfere with our ability to take the necessary steps to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So should we expect a signing statement with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to preview along those lines.\xc2\xa0 I know that in previous occasions when the President signed the bill it has been accompanied by a statement.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not that will be the case this time.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it does, though.<br/>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on Sony.\xc2\xa0 If it is determined that a nation state was behind this attack, does that affect the degree to which the United States would want to respond?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted both by the National Security Division of the Department of Justice and the FBI, who are both looking into this matter cooperatively.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that regardless of who is found to be responsible for this, that the President considers it to be a serious national security matter, and it\xe2\x80\x99s being treated as such both in the course of the investigation but also by leading members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that investigators are closing in on who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the investigation is progressing.\xc2\xa0 This is something they\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking into for quite some time and I know that there is significant investigative resources that have been committed to this effort, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been making progress.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update that\xe2\x80\x99s more specific than that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s big news, is the White House concerned with regard to Cuba about Republicans stopping Treasury and Commerce from changing their regulations to allow expanded trade, particularly in telecoms, which the President mentioned yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not particularly.\xc2\xa0 Primarily because the steps that the President announced are steps that are well within his executive authority as President of the United States and he\xe2\x80\x99s directed the agencies that are responsible for implementing those regulations to make the kinds of changes that are needed to reflect what the President believes is a more effective strategy for dealing with Cuba.</p>\n<p>That said, we certainly would welcome the kind of legislative action, specifically repealing Helms-Burton, that would roll back even more of the restrictions that are currently in place that limit some economic activity between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 The President has done all that he can do using his executive authority, and the remaining restrictions can only be removed through congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly would encourage Congress to act in bipartisan fashion to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, has the White House -- has the President seen the Secret Service review and is he satisfied with it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has.\xc2\xa0 I know that senior officials here at the White House will be briefed before the end of the week on that report, if they haven\'t been already.\xc2\xa0 But again, I anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more -- that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to obtain more information on this today from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today for sure?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That certainly would be my expectation.\xc2\xa0 It was my, actually, understanding that they were supposed to release it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 But I do anticipate that they will have figured out whatever kinks that were in the system and will take care of that important piece of business today.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re calling it a national security matter.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t consider it a national security threat at this point?\xc2\xa0 In other words, that there might be other attacks coming?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Christi, we certainly have seen -- well, let me actually step back and say -- I know you referred to it as the North Korea matter.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the way it\xe2\x80\x99s been widely reported.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm any attribution at this point.\xc2\xa0 But certainly as a general matter, the President does view some of the attacks that we have seen in recent years as a threat to our national security.\xc2\xa0 And there has been an effort underway throughout the President\xe2\x80\x99s first six years in office to do what he can do, again, using his executive authority, to try to better prepare our country to defend against those attacks and to respond to them when they occur.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI can give you a couple of examples of things that the President has succeeded in doing.\xc2\xa0 We have taken steps to better protect our infrastructure both here in the federal government and working with the private sector to help them protect their infrastructure from attacks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard to tighten up and secure federal computer networks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve sought to improve our capability as it relates to both investigating these intrusions and responding to them.\xc2\xa0 We have sought to build a stronger cooperative relationship in working with countries around the world to confront this threat.\xc2\xa0 And we have also been working at a variety of agencies to develop more sophisticated technology, again, that would better defend our networks and allow us to more effectively respond when intrusions occur.<br/>\n\tSo there have been a number of steps that this administration has been taking because of the perception of this national security threat.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s also the reason that we continue to call on Congress to act on cybersecurity legislation. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me on a variety of occasions stand up here and urge Congress to take action on this.\xc2\xa0 This is not the kind of topic that should allow us to be divided along party lines.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has a clear impact on our economy and has a clear impact on our national security.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that Democrats and Republicans should be able to work together on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just because you used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cproportional response,\xe2\x80\x9d does that mean that one of the things you\xe2\x80\x99re considering would be a kind of attack on computers where the attacks originated akin to ones that were launched against Sony?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate at this point about the range of options that are currently under consideration.\xc2\xa0 I also wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t commit at this point to at some point being entirely transparent about what that response is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could you also say how provoking the U.S. might be of benefit to the people who did this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to do that in the abstract.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that there are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine that there may be some organizations or individuals who would perceive a specific response from the United States as something that might enhance their standing, either among their cohorts or colleagues, or even on the international stage.</p>\n<p>So, again, I point that out only to indicate that we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of that phenomenon as we consider the range of options.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to circle back, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out a proportional response of taking attack on this, the computers from which the attacks originated -- you didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule that out.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in fact, I have indicated that we believe this destructive activity merits an appropriate response.\xc2\xa0 But I would acknowledge that an appropriate response is something that is not always obvious, but is something that is worthy of careful consideration.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team is doing.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is a government -- a foreign government that is behind this attack on Sony, would that merit sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are a range of options that are under consideration right now.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on which options might work best.\xc2\xa0 There are people that have a lot more experience and expertise in this area who are considering this question, and once they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a decision I do anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to tell you a little bit more about that decision.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned to Christi, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to be completely forthcoming about every single element of the response that has been decided upon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that imminent, this decision on a response?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what will come first is more information about the investigation and some conclusions about the investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- get that sometime today, tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with either the Department of Justice or the FBI.\xc2\xa0 I know that they have made -- that investigation has been progressing, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact timing in terms of when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to start talking about that a little bit more publicly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not prepared to say here at the podium that North Korea was behind this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to ascribe any accountability for this specific act, or to describe who might have been the sophisticated actor that initiated it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the President discuss this with the Japanese Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0 I know that was not in the readout of that call.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details about their conversation beyond what was included in the readout.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yesterday you said the President would be willing\xc2\xa0 -- or potentially might be willing to go to Cuba someday.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling it out.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President welcome Raul Castro to the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical as well.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Mr. Castro has necessarily indicated a desire to travel to the United States and visit the White House.\xc2\xa0 I guess what I would say is that there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any more outrageous than the President going down to Cuba?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I suppose not, considering that the analogy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to draw -- or at least identify is that there are important national security reasons for the President to travel to other countries that have what we would describe at best as checkered human rights records.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President did, as we discussed yesterday, travel recently to both China and Burma.\xc2\xa0 These are countries where the President has urged the leadership of those countries to do a better job of respecting universal human rights.\xc2\xa0 The President traveled to those countries both because he believed it was in our national security interest, but also because he viewed it as an important opportunity to raise concerns about those nations\xe2\x80\x99 human rights records; that having an open relationship in which the President engages with the leaders of other countries can actually serve as a useful way to shine a spotlight on the shortcomings of other countries\xe2\x80\x99 records as it relates to human rights.</p>\n<p>He did that when he was in China.\xc2\xa0 He did that when he was standing next to the Chinese President.\xc2\xa0 And that did provoke a, as many of you will recall, pretty memorable exchange between the Chinese President and an American journalist.\xc2\xa0 That kind of exchange that attracted that kind of attention would not have occurred if the President refused to visit the country, or if we refused to visit with that country because we had objections to their human rights record.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling it out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess the point is that the President has had the leaders of both Burma and China to the United States, and for that reason I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out a visit from President Castro.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sneak it in -- is the President feeling more liberated after these midterm elections?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion about that -- Cuba, immigration, climate.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s next?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I noticed that there was a cover headline in a local media outlet describing the President in that fashion but using the Spanish version of that word.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is, as a general matter -- here we are in what is likely to be my last press briefing of the year -- that there has been a tremendous amount that the President has accomplished --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Had me hanging there for a second.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements to make, Jim, so don\xe2\x80\x99t get too excited.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earnest libre.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 I will say that it has been -- in many ways, it has been a rather consequential year in this administration -- in this President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in office; that if you review the substantial accomplishments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve racked up here, particularly in the last few weeks, from the historic climate deal with China to finally taking action to address some of the broken aspects of our immigration system, to obviously this substantial historic announcement on Cuba -- that the President is pleased with the kind of progress that we have made; that we began this year suggesting that this would -- that 2014 would be a year of action and here in the last couple of weeks of the year, I think, looking back, we can say that, by any measure, that goal has been accomplished.</p>\n<p>But there is a lot more that needs to get done, and the President has a long list of things that he is looking forward to tackling in the new year after a couple weeks with his family over the holidays.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of what you just said to Jim about engaging with Cuba, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow up on a question from yesterday that Ed asked you.\xc2\xa0 So if engagement works when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a country with a bad human rights record, or a country that behaves poorly, why not North Korea?\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the difference?\xc2\xa0 Because you answered very directly yesterday -- you said, no, the President is not considering normalizing relations with North Korea.\xc2\xa0 He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t welcome Kim Jong Un to the White House.\xc2\xa0 He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t visit Kim Jong Un.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All of that is correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you explain why, given what you just said about how you think that kind of engagement is what works?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because the principal concern that\xe2\x80\x99s been raised about Cuba is about the deplorable human rights record that the Castro regime has.\xc2\xa0 And for 50 years -- more than 50 years -- for five decades, there was in place a policy to try to compel the Castro regime to change that record by isolating them.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, that policy failed, because the Castro regime remained in power and continued to take steps that oppressed their people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Kim family has been in power a long time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They have.\xc2\xa0 And the point is that policy had failed and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to try a new strategy to get the Castro regime to better implement policies that don\xe2\x80\x99t oppress the basic universal human rights of their people.</p>\n<p>Our concerns about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s behavior certainly include their deplorable human rights record, but they also include other things, too.\xc2\xa0 It includes significant concerns with their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 It concerns the threatening statements that they have made about their neighbors who happen to be strong allies of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>So our concerns with the regime in North Korea are different than the concerns that we have with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 There is no concern that the Cuban regime is, for example, developing a nuclear weapon or testing long-range missile technology.\xc2\xa0 That was, frankly, from a previous era.\xc2\xa0 That era has closed, and that is why we believe that the policy needs to be changed to reflect the fact that that era no long exists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you think this policy of isolation is ultimately going to work with North Korea?\xc2\xa0 I understand that the transgressions of North Korea are in many ways qualitatively different than Cuba, but I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the approach.\xc2\xa0 Because all the same things could be said -- this has been a long time and there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been no progress in changing North Korean behavior.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there has been.\xc2\xa0 I mean, at the end of the previous administration there was a move to begin to relax some sanctions in exchange for the North Koreans to take some steps to come into compliance with the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear weapons program.\xc2\xa0 The North Korean regime walked back from those commitments.</p>\n<p>So there have been some attempts to at least consider changing our policy towards North Korea.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the problem of North Korea poses a rather vexing policy challenge to the United States but also to the broader international community, particularly our allies that are much closer to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And the United States continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Republic of Korea and Japan as they confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by North Korea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Sony hack, what does the President think of the decision of Sony Pictures to pull the movie, to basically give in to the blackmail?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is a decision that Sony should make.\xc2\xa0 This is a private company, these are artists who have created a film and it should be their decision about how and whether to release it.\xc2\xa0 This is not a decision --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was a decision made under duress.\xc2\xa0 This was a decision that was made as the result of a direct threat.\xc2\xa0 They clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to pull this movie, but they were forced to.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a decision that they should make -- a decision that they should make, not one that the federal government should be making.\xc2\xa0 But I can say again, as a general matter, the United States stands squarely on the side of artists and companies that want to express themselves, and we believe that that kind of artistic expression is worthy of protection and is not something that should be subjected to intimidation just because you happen to disagree with the views.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the intimidators won here, whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s North Korea -- and I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out officially soon, but regardless of who it was, they won.\xc2\xa0 They succeeded.\xc2\xa0 They wanted this movie pulled; the movie was pulled.\xc2\xa0 I understand the government is not going to force Sony to go forward with the movie, but what do you make of that?\xc2\xa0 This was a direct threat. This was an act of cyberterrorism, or whatever you want to call it.\xc2\xa0 It worked.\xc2\xa0 It succeeded.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have seen, Jon, is we have seen that there has been destructive activity with malicious intent.\xc2\xa0 And the administration believes that that activity merits an appropriate response from the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- this is something that is being investigated, and the appropriate response is something that is being carefully considered by members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in part, this is a detective story.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that North Korea is a nation of interest in the investigation of the Sony hack?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the FBI and the Department of Justice on that question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not even within your range to say that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything that would be perceived by anybody as interfering in any way with their investigation.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to say at this point is to confirm that the National Security Division of the Department of Justice is working with the FBI to determine what happened and to determine who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for it.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is that investigation is progressing, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more that I can say about it than that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is part of the problem that this could be somewhat murky and that the direct responsibility might not be a national -- nation state actor, but someone contracted or affiliated or financed through various means by a nation state actor, but the direct responsibility may lie elsewhere?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on this other than to confirm what I think is the premise of your question, which is that these kinds of investigations are extraordinarily complex because the issues at play here are necessarily murky, as you describe them.\xc2\xa0 I would agree that that\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate description of the circumstances here.</p>\n<p>And that is why -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a team of experts that\xe2\x80\x99s very focused on this.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to get out ahead of what they\xe2\x80\x99re learning over the course of their investigation.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also why some of the senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team have been meeting on a daily basis here at the White House to consider this matter and to consider the range of appropriate responses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you describe the direct level of participation of the President in these meetings so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So far, I can tell you that the President has -- is understandably interested in the conversations that are underway, and this is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s monitoring very closely himself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he participating in these meetings, or has he to date?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any presidential participation to read out at this point, but I can assure you this is something that has taken up some time on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule on a daily basis over the last several days at least.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question, do you believe, as some in the artistic community have suggested, and it may be a larger corporate-culture conversation, that there could be broader repercussions from Sony\xe2\x80\x99s decision and what this illustrates the vulnerabilities are and the potential corporate consequences of a cyber attack?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sympathetic to the very difficult decision that they had to make, and there are a lot of equities that they had to balance, both in terms of the way to release this movie, the way that it could be shown.\xc2\xa0 I know that there was a reluctance from some of the movie theaters to commit to showing the film, and that certainly weighed on the decision that Sony had to make.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sympathetic to that.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately this is a decision that they had to make based on their own best interests and based on the freedom that they have to express themselves as artists.</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that this administration and this President stand squarely on the side of a right to free expression, even when the expression of those views by some is considered to be offensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I may be dense, but you described this as a national security matter.\xc2\xa0 Can you flesh that out a little bit?\xc2\xa0 Because to many of us -- maybe just me -- it looks like principally an economic security matter, or a matter of economics, commerce, artistic freedom, things like that.\xc2\xa0 What is the broadly defined national security component of this from your perspective?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Certainly, those elements apply here, that there is a financial impact of this activity.\xc2\xa0 But what we saw here that is maybe not unprecedented but is certainly unique is that the activity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen here is destructive with clear malicious intent.\xc2\xa0 And it was carried out by, all appearances, a sophisticated actor.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that, in the mind of the President, elevates this to the level of being a legitimate national security matter, and it\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated as such by the FBI and the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team assembled to consider a range of responses that we believe at this point is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clear up one thing from yesterday -- you made mention of it.\xc2\xa0 There was blowback from the Hill about this -- funding for an embassy.\xc2\xa0 But there is an Interest Section building in Havana currently; rather large, somewhat spacious.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States even need to construct a new embassy in Havana to facilitate the opening of diplomatic relations?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned yesterday you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need appropriations for a new building, suggesting you might still need one.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure out -- this is a rather large building there now.\xc2\xa0 Can we do all the business that we intend to do there, and this is kind of a non-issue entirely?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to evaluate as we begin the process of normalizing relations with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned yesterday and as you\xe2\x80\x99re pointing out now, there is already a substantial American diplomatic presence in Cuba and it resides at a significant structure that essentially is the American Interests Section there in Cuba, and there is business done on a daily basis with Cuban citizens.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the range of engagement that American diplomats have with Cuban government officials will expand as a result of this decision and as a result of our efforts to begin to normalize relations with Cuba.</p>\n<p>One of the leading proponents of this strategy of shutting off funding for the construction of an embassy and the appointment of an ambassador to Cuba is Senator Rubio of course. In thinking about this, it occurs to me that it seems odd that Senator Rubio would be reluctant and, in fact, actively seeking to block the appointment of an ambassador to Cuba when earlier this year he voted to confirm the ambassador to China that the President nominated his former colleague, Max Baucus -- who\xe2\x80\x99s doing an excellent job representing the United States in China, I might add.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I noticed is that in the context of those hearings, Senator Rubio said something that this administration wholeheartedly agrees with.\xc2\xa0 Let me read it to you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 All right?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this good?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 Be careful what you ask for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Senator Rubio said, and I quote, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find broad consensus on this committee and I hope in the administration\xe2\x80\x9d -- he does -- \xe2\x80\x9cthat our embassy, the American embassy, should be viewed as an ally of those within the Chinese society that are looking to express their fundamental rights to speak out and to worship freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We think the exact same thing can be said of the new American embassy in Cuba.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Since you intimated that this is your last briefing of the year, can I put on my calendar that President Obama will be the briefer tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You can put on your calendar that the President will convene his traditional end-of-the-year news conference tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe it will be in the afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get some more details on the timing to you before the end of the day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glad I asked.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Dorning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 News you can use.\xc2\xa0 Afternoon.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Russia sanctions, two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, today, President Hollande of France is publicly raising the idea of easing up the sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Is there some distance opening between the U.S. on these sanctions and European partners, or do we agree with him that maybe we should think about easing up on the sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that, Mike.\xc2\xa0 The first is that we have said from the very beginning that the success of the sanctions regime depends upon the effective coordination and cooperation of the United States with other members of the international community, including France, and we have worked very effectively with France and other countries to maximize the impact of this sanctions regime on China [Russia] and to focus the costs on the Russian economy without disadvantaging American businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing that I will point out is that after the latest ratcheting up of the sanctions regime that was announced at the NATO meeting earlier this fall, the President convened a news conference at the end of the NATO meeting and said that if Russia were to begin to live up to the commitments that they signed onto in Minsk and were to begin showing tangible evidence of their commitment to respecting the territorial integrity of a nation like Ukraine, that the President would be prepared to begin rolling back our sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>So I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the entirety of President Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, but based on the way that you described them, it sounds consistent with the sentiment that the President expressed earlier this fall.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separately, a day before the President end-of-the-year news conference President Putin had his end-of-the-year news conference today.\xc2\xa0 And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like he was giving in.\xc2\xa0 He was saying, we have to be ready in Russia for two years of economic downturn, and he compared what the U.S. is trying to do to Russia with the sanctions to trying to chain a bear and then rip out its teeth and claws.\xc2\xa0 Is that what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do?\xc2\xa0 And what do you read from his comments?\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like someone who\xe2\x80\x99s giving in easily.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly aware of President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that President Putin has repeatedly attempted to shift blame for the conflict in Ukraine and the internal problems that Russia is experiencing away from his own policies, both in his speeches and in the government-funded propaganda that is disseminated not only inside Russia but beyond its borders.\xc2\xa0 The revisionist narrative of the crisis in Ukraine is deeply troubling but utterly unconvincing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States has made clear repeatedly that it\xe2\x80\x99s the choices of Russian leaders and actions that Russian leaders have taken with respect to Eastern Ukraine that has caused this conflict in the first place.\xc2\xa0 And it is in response to those destabilizing actions that the United States and the broader international community has imposed sanctions.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I would point you to is what I said in response to the question about whether or not the President would sign the sanctions bill that\xe2\x80\x99s on his desk.\xc2\xa0 What I noted is that we do believe that a diplomatic solution is one that will provide a lasting resolution to the conflict and help to promote growth and stability in Ukraine and in Russia.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is pretty clear evidence about what our aims are here.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s rather colorful imagery is at all an accurate description of either the situation or our goals.\xc2\xa0 The goal of the international community is to resolve this conflict in Eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 President Putin has repeatedly refused to take steps that even he has committed to, to try to resolve this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the international community has acted to send a clear signal to President Putin that there will be economic consequences for his failure to respect basic international norms, including the territorial integrity of a neighboring country.</p>\n<p>So the person with the most influence for resolving this situation is actually, and maybe even somewhat ironically, President Putin.\xc2\xa0 If he lives up to these commitments and if he lives up to the international norms that are generally accepted across the globe, he can have some influence over the international community in terms of prompting the international community to start to roll back the sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And logistically, when you say the President will sign the sanctions bill, is he going to do that today, do you know?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that that will be today, but we will let you know through the usual process of sending a pro forma notification.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Viquiera.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 If I could reframe Major\xe2\x80\x99s question -- how did the Sony case go from a case of corporate espionage to a national security threat?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, because of the destructive activity with malicious intent that is evident from this situation.\xc2\xa0 I know there have been reports about the substantial number of computers and other equipment that have been destroyed as a result of this attack.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the intent of whatever this sophisticated actor is went beyond what you described, and it ventures into the territory of being destructive.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that that kind of behavior is consistent with a national security matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there one revelation, piece of evidence, discovery that led to this sort of escalation in rhetoric here?\xc2\xa0 And does it go beyond Sony?\xc2\xa0 Is that the implication?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99ve found?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s been found, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let the Department of Justice and the FBI speak to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it go beyond Sony?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the FBI and the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re looking into -- among the other things that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking into is the scope of this activity.\xc2\xa0 So you can ask them about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the 2:00 p.m. meeting the President has scheduled, is this on the agenda, this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This issue?\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to rephrase another question if I can, Josh. Sony -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s -- if we call this terrorism, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s something state-sponsored or it\xe2\x80\x99s cyber terror -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to draw a direct analogy, but in the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times from the podium that the U.S. is against ransom in the case of kidnappings because it encourages other kidnappings, is there a concern that Sony, in withdrawing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview,\xe2\x80\x9d might encourage further similar activity?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you did draw one analogy that I do think is appropriate, and I do think -- well, and I can actually say that it has influenced the way that we here at the White House and the way that this administration responds to these specific incidents.</p>\n<p>Within the last year, Lisa Monaco, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s top counterterrorism advisor, has stood up something called the Cyber Response Group.\xc2\xa0 And she did that based on the recognition that our administration, and the U.S. government more generally, even predating this administration, has learned a lot about the appropriate way for us to respond to acts of terror and incidents of terrorism, or even threats of terrorism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd Lisa identified something I think that is appropriate, which is that for a long time the risk of cyber-attacks was sort of siloed in a compartment of individuals that had extensive expertise as it relates to information technology and computer networks and the like.\xc2\xa0 And what Lisa found is that it\xe2\x80\x99s useful for us to pool our knowledge in the same way that we pool the knowledge of a variety of agencies when responding to terror threats.\xc2\xa0 And so what that allows for is it allows for different agencies to come together and sit around the table, literally -- these are members of intelligence community, military leaders, diplomatic leaders, law enforcement officials and homeland security officials -- to sit down and evaluate a problem.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis will allow us to have the kind of agile defense and response that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary when dealing with a threat like a cyber-attack.\xc2\xa0 And this is consistent with the kind of response that this administration and, again, even the previous administration has honed in responding to threats from terror; that what\xe2\x80\x99s required is a quick evaluation of the problem and an effective, prompt, coordinated response.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have tried to deploy over the course of the last year to these specific situations.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the global economic reach of the movie industry, is there concern that giving the terrorists, the criminals what they wanted just encourages others to do the same?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the truth is, Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what this sophisticated actor was trying to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the movie shown.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to identify who the sophisticated actor is, so it would be hard for me to ascribe any motive to an individual whom I do not know.\xc2\xa0 What is clear, however, is that they did carry out destructive activity with malicious intent.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that this administration takes very seriously.\xc2\xa0 We view it as a legitimate national security matter.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated accordingly.\xc2\xa0 And an appropriate response will be attendant as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple quick questions on the Secret Service report that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out.\xc2\xa0 Jeh Johnson said today that already the Acting Director has made some changes, which we all know about, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging him to continue with those changes.\xc2\xa0 Is there any urgency to name a permanent new director?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I suspect that the interim director probably feels some of that urgency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President or the White House feel the urgency?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly this is a very important job. And as I have said on a number of occasions, the President, the First Lady, and everybody here at the White House is appreciative of the commitment that Mr. Clancy has made in leaving his private sector job temporarily to come over here and to assume this very important responsibility at a really important time for the agency.</p>\n<p>So his brief tenure so far has been characterized by the kind of professionalism and confidence that, frankly, is exactly what we all expected.\xc2\xa0 So he is somebody that has a sterling reputation and he\xe2\x80\x99s lived up to it in the confines of his current role.</p>\n<p>What I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that we certainly do believe that having a permanent director in place is important, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this independent panel that was stood up take very seriously their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure that their recommendations are carefully reviewed.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you in terms of timing about when a new director would be appointed.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Johnson also said that -- obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s seen the report, reviewed the report -- that there are fundamental systemic issues with the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel he and his family are safe in the interim while these changes are going to be made?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned earlier and on a number of occasions in briefings earlier this fall, the President does have confidence in the men and women of the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 These are dedicated professionals with a lot of expertise who are willing to put their lives on the line to protect the President and his family.\xc2\xa0 They also work hard to protect all of us, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99re grateful for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is clear that some changes are needed.\xc2\xa0 As you pointed out, Mr. Clancy is putting in place some of those changes, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider the recommendations from this independent panel of experts about additional changes that be necessary.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, given your transparency to Major about the news conference, any sense on early next year when the President would like to do a State of the Union?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date yet.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the President has been invited yet by the Speaker of the House, who traditionally does that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there have already been some conversations about this.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know as soon -- well, I guess the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office will let you know as soon as they have made a decision.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot of coordination that goes on behind the scenes to make sure that we choose a date that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule but also appropriate for the schedule of the members of Congress who will be in attendance as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to Sony.\xc2\xa0 I know you said the White House does not want to dictate to Sony about what they should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 But the Daily Beast has gotten some emails that show that at least two Obama administration officials screened a rough cut of this movie, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview,\xe2\x80\x9d some months ago -- I believe back in June -- including the final scene that allegedly shows the dictator\xe2\x80\x99s head explode.\xc2\xa0 And essentially, these administration officials felt, despite the sensitivity, it was okay to move forward.\xc2\xa0 Can you, first of all, tell us what involvement the Obama administration had months ago in this film, and why you even got involved?\xc2\xa0 Was it because you were concerned that this would become a big deal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, Ed, there is no policy at the administration for screening films before they are released.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that there\xe2\x80\x99s no policy in place that requires this.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised, however -- and I think this is apparent in the emails that were released -- that administration officials were consulted about the film prior to its release at the request of officials from the company that was producing the movie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting you were dictating to them, but I\xe2\x80\x99m saying you had an involvement months ago in this.\xc2\xa0 So did this administration underestimate the impact this was going to have?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, because we would not have been in a position of dictating an outcome or dictating changes to a film.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why get involved at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We did so at the request of the company.\xc2\xa0 So again, you had this private company that had come to administration officials seeking their input, and that was -- presumably that input was shared.\xc2\xa0 But certainly nothing was dictated.\xc2\xa0 And changes that were made to the film were made by the film\xe2\x80\x99s creators themselves; certainly nothing that was created by the administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you make an important distinction that the President can\xe2\x80\x99t tell Sony, do this or don\xe2\x80\x99t this.\xc2\xa0 But given the fact that they were twisting in the wind, the company, for several days about what to do, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the company and other senior officials here speak out and say, look, whatever decision you make, you\xe2\x80\x99re an American company, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got your back?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was asked something along these lines in the interview he did with Jon\xe2\x80\x99s network just yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About theaters.\xc2\xa0 And he said people should go to theaters.\xc2\xa0 But what about the fact that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that is a pretty strong show of support for the artists who are making films these days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought the context of the question was about the concern about terror threats out there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was.\xc2\xa0 But I think it was also a show of support for artists and others who are making films, including the artists who made this film, that they have a right to be able to express themselves and produce these kinds of movies, even if some people happen to find their brand of humor offensive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I want to go to a last subject.\xc2\xa0 On executive orders, executive actions.\xc2\xa0 USA Today has taken a look, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember some months ago the President claimed that he was using executive orders \xe2\x80\x9cat the lowest rate in more than a hundred years.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And then USA Today looked at the fine print and, yes, 195 executive orders less than Democratic and Republican predecessors.\xc2\xa0 But when you add on 198 presidential memoranda, it actually turns out he\xe2\x80\x99s using a lot more executive action than his predecessors, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the President has sought to use his executive authority to move this country forward within the confines of the law, oftentimes in the face of congressional inaction.\xc2\xa0 That I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t disagree with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why did he make this public claim that there\xe2\x80\x99s this criticism that I\xe2\x80\x99m acting on executive basis, and I\xe2\x80\x99m doing that less -- the lowest level in a hundred years?\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really true, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was true, because the level -- the number of executive orders that this President has issued is lower, as you pointed out, than executive orders that have been issues by many of his previous predecessors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presidential memoranda have essentially the same effect.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s called something different.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking a lot more executive action.\xc2\xa0 Why would he --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is an important difference between executive orders and presidential memorandums.\xc2\xa0 But I would not\xc2\xa0 -- but I would grant the premise that the President has used every element at his disposal to try to move the country forward. And he has done that in a way that is consistent with the law, that is consistent with precedent, and is often carried out in the face of pretty rigid congressional obstruction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last one.\xc2\xa0 What do you see as that distinction?\xc2\xa0 I understand there are legal distinctions.\xc2\xa0 But, big picture, what is the difference?\xc2\xa0 Because both -- it\xe2\x80\x99s still executive action. So what is the big difference according to you or the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, presidential memorandums\xc2\xa0 -- presidential memoranda are associated with more technical issues and are often directives that are related to a subset of agencies.\xc2\xa0 Executive orders, therefore, are more sweeping and often more impactful.\xc2\xa0 But again, I would readily concede that this President has, using executive orders and presidential memoranda, used his executive authority to try to move the country forward as much as he possibly can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd whether it\xe2\x80\x99s taking action on climate change, fixing -- adding some accountability to our broken immigration system, or even relaxing some of the failed trade restriction policies as it relates to Cuba, the President has taken a number of steps, using his executive authority, to move the country forward.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that this was something that was done over the objection of many members of Congress, but frankly, a lot of this was done because Congress was refusing to act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you just said executive orders usually are more sweeping, but in the case of immigration, which you would acknowledge was pretty sweeping, it was a presidential memorandum, not an executive order.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, by your definition -- I\xe2\x80\x99m slightly confused.\xc2\xa0 You said that executive orders are quite sweeping; the immigration one, which you acknowledged was sweeping, actually was not.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that make the point USA Today was trying to make, that no matter what you call it, he was kind of misleading people about how often he\xe2\x80\x99s using executive action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President was being specific about the fact that his predecessors have issued far more executive orders than he has.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody has ever made the case from here about this President, that he is not willing to use his executive authority to move the country forward.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he has, and I think the numbers that you cite demonstrate a commitment to doing exactly that.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Ed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, yesterday President Obama issued another batch of pardons, and yet six years into his presidency he\xe2\x80\x99s issued far fewer pardons than nearly all of his predecessors over the last half-century.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if he feels that he\xe2\x80\x99s stingy with pardons, as some of his critics have said.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President and his administration take this issue very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And we have had the opportunity to talk quite a bit about criminal justice reform over the last few months, and this is something that the President believes is critically important.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that the President has done is sign into law the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.\xc2\xa0 This was a bill that would address the unjust disparity between penalties for crack and powder cocaine, and this reflected some improvements in the way that the law is being carried out and the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s enforced.</p>\n<p>What we have also seen is we have also seen some changes to the sentencing guidelines that have freed up judges to use more discretion when applying sentences and penalties.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly have made some important progress in trying to address some of the current concerns that the President has identified about criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that there is more work that can and should be done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe good news is that there are some Republicans who believe that there is more work that can and should be done.\xc2\xa0 And this would be one area where we would hope we could work with Republicans in the new year to make some progress on an issue that both Democrats and Republicans have identified.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate the President will continue to use the clemency authority that he is granted under the Constitution to try to address some of these problems as well.</p>\n<p>But I think ideally what we would try to do is try to fix some of these problems statutorily so we could fix them on the front end, and future Presidents won\xe2\x80\x99t have to resort to using their clemency authority to try to address some of these disparities that we see in the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe what his criteria are for granting pardons?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty legal description related to this that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to venture into.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like he\xe2\x80\x99s President, he can grant a pardon to anyone he likes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as a factual matter, that is true.\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up with you to see if I have some more specific guidance I can share with you about how these kinds of decisions are reached.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Perhaps I could ask him this tomorrow.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Perhaps you could.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Juliet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, buried in the spending bill was one provision affecting the consideration of the sage grouse and a couple of other grassland birds.\xc2\xa0 The federal government is involved in extensive negotiation with 11 governors out West about what to do.\xc2\xa0 Could you comment on how the White House views that provision and how it will affect what could be a very significant decision regarding endangered species?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Once again, Juliet, this highlights the fact that the omnibus legislation that the President signed earlier this week is a genuinely compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 It includes some riders, like this one, that would essentially prohibit the Fish and Wildlife Service from issuing an endangered species act rule related to the sage grouse.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a rider that we believe is the right policy and certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t appropriate to include on a piece of legislation like this.</p>\n<p>That said, this rider does nothing to stop the administration from continuing bipartisan work with the governors that you cited to put conservation measures in place with the aim of avoiding the need to list the greater sage grouse as threatened or endangered in the first place; that we can take some of these steps as it relates to conservation that would prevent them from reaching the point where they are threatened or endangered in the first place and that would obviously make it so that the Fish and Wildlife Service didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to issue this endangered species act rule.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn fact -- and this is where the good news comes in -- the bill contains funding that will enable the Department of Interior and the United States Department of Agriculture to continue their work to continue sage grouse habitat.\xc2\xa0 The Fish and Wildlife Service will still be able to do the critical data collection and analysis work that\xe2\x80\x99s required to meet a court-ordered deadline to decide whether a listing is warranted under the Endangered Species Act.</p>\n<p>So we certainly do not agree with this provision, but the bill does contain funding for the kinds of conservation measures that we believe will be important to protecting the sage grouse and hopefully preventing the need for any sort of Endangered Species Act rule to be implemented.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 Under what circumstances would the President showcase his support for artists by screening this movie at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements about that now. As I think you know, the President is preparing to leave tomorrow night with his family to go to their traditional Hawaii holiday vacation trip.\xc2\xa0 I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to getting that time away.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the point is I don\'t think we\'re going to be showing the film here anytime soon.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out necessarily in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then -- and I apologize, I missed your briefing yesterday, so if this is well-trod ground just say so.\xc2\xa0 But how will we know in six months, in a year, in 18 months, whether the President\xe2\x80\x99s overtures to Cuba have worked?\xc2\xa0 Based on your own internal guidelines and your own internal criteria, are there very specific concrete deliverables?\xc2\xa0 Can I look at the news out of Cuba in six months and say they\xe2\x80\x99ve let those 53 released prisoners stay and continue their activities?\xc2\xa0 Can I look at they\xe2\x80\x99ve freed up the resort workers to keep more of the money they make in resorts that cater to Western European tourists, say?\xc2\xa0 Are there things I can look at in six months, in a year, in a year and a half, to make that judgment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the first thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out, and I think you\'re alluding to this in your question, is that the President acknowledged pretty directly that we\'re not going to see changes overnight in Cuba, that these kinds of broader social and political changes take time.</p>\n<p>And that said, we certainly should have seen a lot more progress over the last 53 or 54 years since the embargo was put in place than we did see.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a reflection of the fact that that policy failed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President is advocating a different approach, one that emphasizes openness and engagement, and that focuses on empowering the Cuban people to assert more authority and to take more control over their daily lives and to try to bring about the kinds of political and social and economic changes that they would like to see in their own country.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, it should be their decision.</p>\n<p>But I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate -- I do think it would be appropriate for us to evaluate the progress of the Castro regime when it comes to respecting basic human rights by watching how they treat political prisoners, particularly those who have recently been granted their release or soon will be released.\xc2\xa0 There was talk, as the President mentioned yesterday, of the Cuban government taking steps that would allow their citizens greater access to the Internet and greater access to the kind of information that has in many other societies, including this one, succeeded in empowering citizens and individuals to take greater control over their own lives.</p>\n<p>We saw specific commitments from the Castro regime to engage more deeply with both the United Nations and the International Committee for the Red Cross.\xc2\xa0 The engagement and cooperation with those international institutions that champion human rights I think would be another legitimate way for us to evaluate their progress.</p>\n<p>Now, the other thing that I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the President would be quick to point out -- and maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to probe him on this tomorrow -- is that when we see this kind of change, it doesn\'t occur in a straight line.\xc2\xa0 It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be uncommon for us to see a step forward, a step back, two steps forward, another step back.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re looking at is over the longer term.\xc2\xa0 And certainly we do anticipate that because of the strategy change, we will see the Cuban people become more empowered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we will also see that the U.S. policy toward Cuba will no longer be a distraction, and that our partners and allies in the Western Hemisphere who\xe2\x80\x99ve previously come to us complaining about our policy toward Cuba can now spend more time talking to us about the Cuba government\xe2\x80\x99s policy toward its own people.\xc2\xa0 That would be a welcome development.\xc2\xa0 That would shine a light on the situation and put more pressure on the Castro regime to protect and advance the kind of basic human values that we have long championed in this country.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you argue that the same thing has happened in China and Vietnam?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly -- I think there is a clearer story to be told about Vietnam, that the progress that they have made has been important -- certainly not complete, and certainly not a long a straight a line, as I was describing to Olivier -- but we continue to believe that the progress, the economic progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Vietnam will lead to the kind of political and social progress that we have seen.</p>\n<p>Again, this should be about the people of an individual country realizing their aspirations and having some say over how their country and their society is run.\xc2\xa0 And it is the philosophy of this administration, as it has been of previous administrations, that greater openness, that greater engagement, that deeper economic ties facilitates the kinds of economic changes that often lead to the political and social changes that we believe are important, that reflects the kinds of values that we believe should take priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you think they will do it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, in our experience so far, has that happened in China?\xc2\xa0 I mean, to date.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think there are people who are probably better equipped to evaluate this than I am, but I do -- so I\xe2\x80\x99ll let somebody else pass judgment on that.\xc2\xa0 I will say that I believe that the strategy that the President has pursued to engage them is clearly in our national security interest.\xc2\xa0 That goes without saying.\xc2\xa0 And I do think it serves to put more pressure on the Chinese leadership to respect those basic universal human rights.</p>\n<p>Again, as a result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip there, there was extensive coverage and debate about this that would not have occurred had the President not traveled to China.\xc2\xa0 And again, there are a variety of ways to evaluate how much progress has been made and whether that progress is lasting.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, we\'re not going to see that kind of progress travel along a straight line, but the President does retain a lot of confidence in the strategy that it\xe2\x80\x99s worked in many other places too.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of Sony.\xc2\xa0 The first is, I know you mentioned the cybersecurity legislation.\xc2\xa0 Back in 2012, the administration was pretty active in lobbying for this up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 There was a series of classified briefings for lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 Since then, kind of overtly, you guys have said that you\'ve shifted towards kind of trying to handle it administratively.\xc2\xa0 But since you mentioned it to Christi, as much as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve had great success calling for Congress to do things from behind the podium, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional work that you\'re going to do on this issue with Congress in the new session, nd also if Congress is being briefed right now on kind of the developments of the investigation.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, we do retain hope that advancing cybersecurity legislation in the new year can be a bipartisan pursuit.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that there should be divisions along party lines when it comes to an issue that\'s important.</p>\n<p>I can understand given the complexity of the issue that there might be differences of opinion on this, but they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t break down along partisan lines.\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow partisan differences to interfere with our ability to tackle something that\'s this complex, but yet at the same time, that\xe2\x80\x99s this important to the country.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly would hope that we would see some bipartisan movement on this in the new year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The steps that we have taken on our own using the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority were done out of necessity.\xc2\xa0 And there is also a need for Congress to act here, and we hope that they will recognize that and take action in the new year.</p>\n<p>As it relates to your other question, it is not uncommon at all for the administration to work closely with Congress as we confront these kinds of situations related to cyber-attacks.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know of any specific conversations that have occurred, but that is part of the standard operating procedure when it comes to these matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since you\'ve mentioned differences of opinion, I know it will shock you to hear that Senator John McCain has been critical of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the cyber hack.\xc2\xa0 He said that because you guys haven\xe2\x80\x99t responded so far that you\'re effectively yielding to the hackers, and that you also kind of created the window by not responding sooner for Sony to have to make a decision on pulling the movie.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could respond to that, but also if there\xe2\x80\x99s any concern that by maybe slow-walking this investigation to some extent that this window has been --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any evidence to suggest that this investigation has not moved at the pace that is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter that the President takes very seriously.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter that the National Security Division of the Department of Justice and the FBI take very seriously, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been conducting the kind of investigation that you would expect them to do in light of the fact that this is considered by the administration to be a serious national security matter.</p>\n<p>And it would be inappropriate to get ahead of that investigation to start publicly discussing what our response is going to be, particularly in light of the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that at least some of the measures that will be considered as a response are the kinds of things we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to telegraph in advance.\xc2\xa0 So what you have seen is a very professional approach to dealing with this situation, and that reflects the seriousness with which we believe this issues should be confronted.</p>\n<p>Zeke, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put a lot of pressure on you, man, and give you the last question of the year.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So make it a good one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got to rethink this now.\xc2\xa0 So, still on Sony.\xc2\xa0 You said that White House officials are contemplating a response and that response needs to be proportional.\xc2\xa0 How do they -- who are they contemplating responses against?\xc2\xa0 Is there an array of potential perpetrators that we\'re working off of?\xc2\xa0 Are they sort of shooting blindly from the hip who is behind it, or do you actually have a culprit in mind and you\'re just not telling us?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking a very good question, and it illustrates why it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for us to allow the investigation to make some more progress before we start talking publicly about the range of options that are being considered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why do you keep talking about the range of options that are being considered?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that then premature, what you\xe2\x80\x99ve just before in that if you\'re not comfortable talking about who\xe2\x80\x99s behind it, why are you talking about the response?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess because I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty candid about the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking in a lot of detail about what our response is going to be.</p>\n<p>What I am suggesting, though -- and I think this is because of the activity that we have seen -- is that we believe an appropriate response is warranted.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we have begun the process of considering the range of appropriate responses.\xc2\xa0 But any more information about the range of appropriate responses will not be provided until more information about the investigation has been nailed down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just in terms of having a counterattack, that\'s not something that you would do normally when there\xe2\x80\x99s a criminal ring behind this.\xc2\xa0 Is that an indication that, when you say significant actor, that is something larger than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, very large cyber-attacks at -- whether the American businesses that have seen large numbers of credit card numbers stolen or other intellectual property stolen before -- that this is a step beyond that?\xc2\xa0 This is not -- you\'re not going to go carry out counter-cyber-attacks against a band of cybercriminals somewhere overseas?\xc2\xa0 This is different.\xc2\xa0 Are you indicating that this a larger actor here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try to answer your question as best I can.\xc2\xa0 I think the direct answer to your question is, no.\xc2\xa0 What I -- I described him as a sophisticated actor, which does not necessarily describe their size, but it does describe their level of, well, sophistication.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And so that is what we\'re focused on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the other thing -- the other line that I would draw here is that you cited previous incidents in which we saw other sophisticated actors take actions related to cyber theft.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve seen public reports that some people believe that acts of cyber theft have been committed by both state actors as well as more conventional criminal rings.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate at this point about which category this one falls into, other than to say cyber theft is treated differently by this administration than something that is -- than an activity that is destructive with a malicious intent.\xc2\xa0 And because of that, that destructive activity with malicious intent that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, we consider this to be a serious national security matter.</p>\n<p>So, Alexis, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow on that?\xc2\xa0 Zeke was asking something that struck me, and that is, last night the NSC\xe2\x80\x99s statement talked about the government working hard to bring \xe2\x80\x9cthe perpetrators to justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That is not what you\'re saying here today.\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying that you\'re looking for a range of options proportional to what has occurred.\xc2\xa0 So just to follow on what Zeke was saying, did something happen between the statement last night and the knowledge today that left justice, which reflects crime, out of your commentary?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 I think you might be over-reading the statement a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that justice necessarily only refers to crime.\xc2\xa0 After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s the National Security Division of the Department of Justice that is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to review this matter.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest any sort of change in policy or perspective based on last night\xe2\x80\x99s statements and my extensive statements here today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- more facts, a set of facts?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy New Year, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:15 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
