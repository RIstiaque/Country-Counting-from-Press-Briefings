Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  1:24 P.M. EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 My condolences to all of you that weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to go to Las Vegas and Los Angeles, including myself.\xc2\xa0 Let me get organized here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Mr. Feller.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions on the Supreme Court, please.\xc2\xa0 As expected, the debate to try to define Judge Sotomayor is underway from interested parties from the left and from the right.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously had his say yesterday to the American people, but I\'m wondering, as this debate unfolds and heads towards confirmation, what is the White House\'s plan today, every day, to try to influence the debates, to try to make sure your message stays out there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as I said yesterday, Ben, I think the most effective advocate for making the case for the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor is, in fact, Judge Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 She\'s begun reaching out to senators, talking on the phone today with Senators Reid -- Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, and Senator Sessions.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working on a readout of those calls.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that handy at the moment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We anticipate that -- (cell phone rings.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s her now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, calling one of you weighty senators to weigh in on her confirmation.\xc2\xa0 We expect that as the Senate comes back next week, she\'ll begin visits up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as we get scheduling information we\'ll certainly let you know that, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But then, again, I think that this is somebody who brings, as I said yesterday, a richness of experience -- 17 years on the federal bench -- and that if people take an objective and fair look at her record, we think they\'ll come to the conclusion that she\'s highly qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That plan that you just laid out of the Judge herself talking to senators, obviously that happens in a private setting. Meanwhile the debate is happening that the American people are going to be hearing about -- so does the White House have a role in that debate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we\'ll probably find a way to make it easier on you to find legal experts and her colleagues that share the President\'s enthusiasm about the pick.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t doubt that we won\'t do that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it\'s -- I think that we\'ll certainly play a role in that.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, our strong belief is that she has a record that speaks highly of who she is as a judge.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on that, if I could.\xc2\xa0 You made a comment yesterday, "I think the President picked the person he believed best suited for the job at this time."\xc2\xa0 And in his C-SPAN interview a few days ago, the President said, different times call for different justices, and he mentioned the civil rights movement in particular in that comment.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering, what is it specifically about this time that makes Judge Sotomayor the right pick?\xc2\xa0 What does the nation\'s current state have to do with it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- and I don\'t necessarily mean that in relation to six months from now would he have picked somebody else.\xc2\xa0 I think what he got in the pick of Judge Sotomayor, as I said yesterday, was somebody who brings a wealth of experience.\xc2\xa0 The President was impressed with her approach to judging and a compelling life story that I think underscores the President\'s desire to have somebody that understands the role the Supreme Court plays in the everyday lives of the American people and looking for somebody to bring their common sense and that perspective to the Court.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions, first on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the administration\'s reaction to North Korea\'s threat to attack South Korea after it said it would join a U.S.-led plan to check vessels suspected of carrying materials that could be used for weapons of mass destruction?\xc2\xa0 And is the U.S. taking any precautions, militarily or otherwise, to cope with this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on any military precautions.\xc2\xa0 I would say this:\xc2\xa0 that threats are not going to bring -- threats won\'t get North Korea the attention it craves.\xc2\xa0 Their actions are continuing to further deepen their own isolation from the international community and from the rights and obligations that they themselves have agreed to live up to.\xc2\xa0 As an example, I think a rough count -- this is the fifth time in 15 years that they\'ve sought to nullify the armistice governing the Korean War.\xc2\xa0 And I think their actions would be better focused on living up to their rights and obligations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying you\'re not really taking the threat seriously?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we\'re certainly concerned and take any threat seriously.\xc2\xa0 But my sense is they\'re trying to get renewed attention through saber rattling and bluster and threats, and I think the attention they\'re trying to gain is not going to be successful, given what they\'re trying to do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another subject, oil prices have doubled over the last six months.\xc2\xa0 The Saudi oil minister said today that the global economy could -- was strong enough to cope with oil prices of $75 to $80 a barrel.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the administration\'s reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And is there any concern in the administration that rising oil prices could derail any economic recovery?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is something that the administration obviously watches, but I don\'t have anything directly on the $75 -- look, obviously the President is concerned about anything that raises the cost of living in a fragile economic time.\xc2\xa0 I think it underscores again the President\'s call and commitment to greatly reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the steps that was taken in the last couple weeks were renewed and strengthened fuel mileage standards.\xc2\xa0 And obviously legislation is working its way through Congress that would further decrease that dependence on foreign oil, and we\'d certainly like to see that pass.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be speaking to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia next week about keeping oil prices reined in?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can only imagine that will be a topic, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions, Robert.\xc2\xa0 First of all, a lot of public officials have been complaining that the stimulus dollars just aren\'t getting out to the states and cities quickly enough. In addition, the President made a pretty big deal about going to Columbus, Ohio, and talking about the stimulus dollars saving some cadets jobs.\xc2\xa0 But now Columbus is talking about raising taxes from 2 percent to 2.5 percent, and if they don\'t get this additional revenue they\'re going to have to lay off some of those cadets specifically.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you think that in any way you guys oversold, or the American people got a misimpression about how quickly the stimulus was going to take effect.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, in fact, I think you guys asked me about why only 75 to 80 percent of it would be spent in two years, right?\xc2\xa0 So, look, our focus is on trying to get as much money out the door as quickly as humanly possible while ensuring that there isn\'t waste; that projects that don\'t need to be funded take up money that can and should be going to other projects.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think -- and I don\'t have some of the numbers in front of me, but we\'ve funded thousands of road projects that will create jobs.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- a lot of money clearly has gone out the door to states and localities dealing with things like unemployment insurance, which are tremendously important right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">There is no doubt that many states across the country are facing increasingly difficult economic times.\xc2\xa0 The President understands and is aware of that.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons that we had an increase in money going directly to those states was to try to help those problems.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of the police in Columbus, the President remains committed to that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve actually -- there\'s certainly money in the budget to continue to hire police.\xc2\xa0 But we also understand the stimulus, the recovery plan is a temporary infusion of money into the system.\xc2\xa0 There are long-term budget problems in states and localities that are certainly going to have to be addressed. We\'re monitoring those.\xc2\xa0 The President is doing, and the administration continues to do all that they can to get money out as quickly as humanly possible.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just a separate question.\xc2\xa0 Today in California, Ted Olson, former Solicitor General for President Bush, and David Boies, are introducing a lawsuit against the state of California, saying that by denying same-sex couples the right to marry, the ability to marry they are violating the Equal Protection Rights under the U.S. Constitution for same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 Why are they wrong?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not read the opinion or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President supports the idea that people should be able to -- same-sex couples should be able to enter in civil unions.\xc2\xa0 Boies and Olson -- a very conservative lawyer -- are saying that is a violation --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Olson.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not Boies, right -- Olson, a very conservative lawyer, saying that is a violation of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 It is also the position the President holds, that there should be civil unions, not same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 Why is it not a violation of the Equal Protection clause?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let me have somebody take a look at the pleading that they\'re going to make.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what they\'re arguing --<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Generally.\xc2\xa0 Just forget the specific argument; I\'m just talking about their general argument is that by having -- by not allowing same-sex couples to marry, it is a violation of equal protection.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, well, again --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the President\'s position, so --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But let me -- well, the President\'s position, we\'re all aware of.\xc2\xa0 I hesitate to be general about the legal underpinnings of an argument based on some portion of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 I think that they may be somewhat hard to generalize.\xc2\xa0 So let me have somebody take a look at that and see if we have anything based on what Mr. Olson and Mr. Boies are doing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration -- towards North Korea now -- is the administration frustrated at all that North Korea doesn\'t appear to be intimidated by the global reaction to their test firing of missiles and their nuclear --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That they\'re intimidated?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that they don\'t appear to be intimidated by this. They keep doing these tests.\xc2\xa0 Is there any frustration at all from the administration that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a frustration that the North Koreans don\'t seem to want to live up to the obligations that they\'ve previously made to the international community, and I think the international community has spoken out swiftly about that.\xc2\xa0 You guys all covered when -- around our first trip, their test, and whether or not you could get the Security Council to make a decision to pass some resolution.\xc2\xa0 The unified international condemnation of this came fast and furious.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But again, I think, and I think the vast majority of our allies strongly believe, that what North Korea is doing is hurting North Korea; that they\'re -- I can\'t speak to what motivations they have, except the fact that it underscores the deepening of their actions in isolating themselves from the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s apparent each and every day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a sense that North Korea will back down before this escalates any further?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we are, again, strongly hopeful that they\'ll understand that this is not doing them any good, that it further isolates themselves; they further -- they\'re further -- they\'re farther and farther away from living up to the obligations that they themselves set.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to look at ways to ensure through the access of infrastructure, either banks or ports, that we\'re doing, and our allies are doing, all that we can to ensure that they\'re not moving material that could be used to produce a weapon of mass destruction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things; first, GM.\xc2\xa0 Recently, when Chrysler was front and center, the President singled out investors as one of the causes of that bankruptcy.\xc2\xa0 He said, "It was unacceptable to let a small group of speculators endanger Chrysler\'s future by refusing to sacrifice."\xc2\xa0 Does the President consider GM bondholders to be speculators who refuse to sacrifice?\xc2\xa0 Does he see them in the same light?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, as you know, there is a looming deadline that the President and his task force set for GM to enter into a restructuring agreement that creates the path towards a viable auto company.\xc2\xa0 That deadline is looming.\xc2\xa0 But as I said yesterday I don\'t want to get involved in the day-to-day negotiations from up here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is more than a negotiation.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the bondholders are not playing ball here, just as the speculators did with Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 Does he seem bothered --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the statement --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- refusing to sacrifice the way the speculators did?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think -- well, two things.\xc2\xa0 I do think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they the bad guys?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do think the President strongly believes that, as he said in the lead-up to the Chrysler deadline, that all the stakeholders involved -- the company, labor, management, bondholders, debt-holders -- were all going to have to make some sacrifices if we\'re going to see GM continue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I would also point out, I think, Chip, that statement came at a point in which the vast majority -- I think it later became public that basically the people that were holding out sort of vociferously represented far less than 5 percent of the company. Instead of prejudging how the negotiations will go over the course of the next several days as we lead up to that deadline, I\'d let those stakeholders continue that negotiation in order to get the best possible outcome for GM, for its workers, for the communities that GM is in, and for the taxpayers of this country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he doesn\'t see them in the same light, the bondholders and GM, in the same light that he saw the speculators in Chrysler?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re talking about a statement that -- you\'re talking about holdouts when, again, probably 97 or 98 percent of the people had an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working towards -- our hope is an agreement with all the stakeholders involved to continue General Motors, and I think we\'re making progress and hopefully we\'ll have news to report soon on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you familiar with -- switching topics for a moment to Sotomayor -- are you familiar with Newt Gingrich\'s blog -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You are not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, he apparently -- I\'m told it is on his blog that he said, "Imagine a judicial nominee said \'my experience as a white man makes me better than a Latino woman.\'\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t they have to withdraw?\xc2\xa0 New racism is no better than old racism.\xc2\xa0 A white man racist nominee would be forced to withdraw. A Latino woman racist should also withdraw."</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is probably important for anybody involved in this debate to be exceedingly careful with the way in which they\'ve decided to describe different aspects of this impending confirmation.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re satisfied that when the people of America and the people of the Senate get a chance to look at more than just the blog of a former lawmaker --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also tweeted us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that they\'ll come to the same conclusion that the President did:\xc2\xa0 that judicial experience that exceeds any nominee -- federal judicial experience that exceeds any nominee for a hundred years, strict adherence to precedent -- I think when people get a chance to look at her record, I feel certain that partisan politics will take a backseat to common sense and open-minded decisions based on a full examination of the record. And I think that\'s what every Supreme Court and every judicial nominee deserves.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think if you look at -- again, I mentioned this yesterday -- this is somebody who was appointed by George Herbert Walker Bush and Bill Clinton, approved by the Senate in each occasion. So I think she is somebody who is highly qualified, of keen intellect, and somebody that\'s going to be a great member of the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve heard a lot of people in the last couple days, they\'ve mentioned intellect.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not entirely sure where people that make that argument -- I\'m not sure what number they graduated in their class at Princeton, but my sense is it\'s not second.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President moves on to Los Angeles today, where he hosts a fundraiser where the top price is up to a reported $30,000, at the Beverly Hills Hilton or at one of the Beverly Hills hotels.\xc2\xa0 A congressman from the Central Valley of California, Jim Costa, says, "The President is not feeling any empathy towards me.\xc2\xa0 He promised he would visit the California heartland. He\'s not doing that.\xc2\xa0 He\'s merely attending a fundraiser here."\xc2\xa0 Is the President taking California for granted politically?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see how that would be the case.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve certainly -- I don\'t know how many days we spent out there earlier on a I think a two- or three-day trip.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t -- I didn\'t go on that one either; I seem to miss out on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But today\'s context includes the financial crisis there and the controversy over Proposition 8.\xc2\xa0 The President, as far as we know, is not going to speak out on any of these issues while he\'s in California.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s appropriate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s try not to mix up the questions here and let me see if I can keep them straight.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that the President isn\'t concerned about the economic conditions of this country I don\'t think holds a lot of validity, given the actions that he\'s taken to get our economy moving again; to get the resources that California needs to invest in their infrastructure and to take care of their citizens; to ensure that kids have health care.\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s taken steps to do that and I think most people in California are confident in that, as well.<br/> <br/>  \xc2\xa0Jonathan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions, one on the Court and one on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, the Moscow summit is a little more than a month away; that was supposed to show progress on the President\'s very ambitious arms control agenda that was laid out in Prague.\xc2\xa0 Part of that was supposed to be some movement on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and movement ahead of the nonproliferation treaty meetings next year.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder what impact a nuclear test is going to have on movement on those two issues.\xc2\xa0 Is it going to undermine progress on the test ban and on the nonproliferation treaty, or somehow will it redouble efforts?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it gives the entire world the unique opportunity to take the strong steps that the President has outlined.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re all keenly aware of what\'s involved and the stakes that are involved, and I know that the team continues to work ahead of the Moscow summit in order to make progress on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think they\'re working toward that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a time -- I mean, is there any thought of submitting the CTBT to the Senate --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC guys on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on the Court, President Bush would routinely bring in outside people, greybeards, sherpas, to chaperone his nominees around the Senate.\xc2\xa0 What makes you guys seem so confident that you don\'t feel like you need that kind of team working for Judge Sotomayor?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the absence of a certain colored beard I don\'t think denotes a casualness about which we\'re going the confirmation process.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the team is -- there\'s a team here that\'s very involved in this.\xc2\xa0 I will check the color of their facial hair at the conclusion of this briefing; I don\'t think Mr. Klain grew one overnight.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But there are people in the Counsel\'s office, people that are in the Vice President\'s office, the West Wing, that are working on this.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not -- I don\'t think you could look at what happened yesterday and say that we\'re taking any of this lightly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President know for a fact that Judge Sotomayor supports the ruling in Roe v. Wade?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, Mark, the President doesn\'t have a litmus test and that question was not one that he posed to her.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t he make that a campaign promise, that he would appoint justices who support --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look -- I don\'t know whether -- I don\'t remember exactly what was said on that topic, but I can look that up.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Matt\'s question.\xc2\xa0 When he meets with King Abdullah next week, you said that he\'d -- you would imagine that oil would be on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 What would the President ask King Abdullah?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to get into the full meeting agenda and all that\'s going to be said on each side.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll likely have an opportunity to read out that meeting after it happens.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he ask for the Saudis to increase --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 See previous answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switch to GM.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned, in response to Chip\'s question, "we\'re making progress."\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t bankruptcy a fait accompli?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the deadline is near but it\'s not passed yet.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see -- look, there could be, as happened in the case of Chrysler, there could be progress on an agreement with stakeholders leading up to something that might be an eventual bankruptcy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only thing left was the bondholders and their deadline passed last night at 11:59 p.m.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, then I will --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s nothing left -- unless I\'m missing something.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you never know.\xc2\xa0 I think that the team continues to work on trying to get all the stakeholders involved to move and make progress and they\'re going to continue to do that up until that deadline.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate that that\'s going to change at all.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on autos -- not in the negotiating realm at all, but last week 36 members of the House wrote a letter to the President saying:\xc2\xa0 We\'re a little concerned that the task force is making decisions that the legislative body also ought to have some role in.\xc2\xa0 They talk about what happened to Chrysler -- this is members of a union who voted to make some sacrifices, yet they found out after the Chrysler deal that their jobs had been terminated.\xc2\xa0 The implications for Chrysler dealerships they say are affecting their constituents.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Can you talk broadly about what it is about the task force that gives it so much legitimate power that members of Congress now wonder if the legislative branch also ought to have a more direct voice and legislative role in as the future of the auto industry is being debated and decided here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s first of all, just for some context, Major, understand that decisions on plant closings and decisions on dealerships are not made by the auto task force or by its members or people that work in the White House.\xc2\xa0 These are decisions that are made by companies about what it is they believe is the best path toward renewed viability for their company.\xc2\xa0 And understand that in the case of Chrysler I think 75 percent of the auto dealers remained open; that encompasses about 87 percent of annual auto sales.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I would say this to any member of Congress and to any member of the public:\xc2\xa0 If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the task force on autos, and if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the President\'s intervention, a hundred percent of those dealerships would be gone, a hundred percent of those plants would be closed, and Roger would have just asked me about the liquidation assets of Chrysler, rather than whether or not we\'re making progress with General Motors.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So, look, Congress certainly is involved in auto decisions obviously as it relates to setting fuel mileage standards that the President worked on last week, as well as proposals to create tax incentives to trade in older cars that aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing as well on fuel mileage, to both increase auto sales and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 But I think the vast majority of members I think are appreciative of the efforts of the task force each and every day in order to keep as much as we possibly can in a viable auto industry here in America.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And those lawmakers who would agree with your initial point that the White House has not made decisions on dealerships or union contracts being terminated or kept, they would also point out that the viability standard is set by the task force and decisions flow from that viability standard set here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, the White House does have an enormous say, some might say an inordinate say, in things affecting their constituents.\xc2\xa0 And your response to that would be?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that we have a major role to play, and I think we are playing it in a way that is preserving and protecting as many jobs as possible, protecting as many communities as possible, and hopefully restructuring -- working to restructure an auto industry that has fallen on vastly hard times, and that we\'re doing all that we can to move that in a different direction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Chip, briefly, are you saying that there\'s no racial dimension and there should be no racial dimension interpreted or drawn from Judge Sotomayor\'s comments made in 2001 at Berkeley -- after she was confirmed both times by the Senate, so the Senate never had a chance to evaluate that, just to point that out -- that there is no racial dimension?\xc2\xa0 Americans who look at that should think, what, if they think that their might be a racial dimension there?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, one, I think Americans should read all of what she talked about.\xc2\xa0 Read the full article.\xc2\xa0 I admonished April yesterday for her YouTube clip.\xc2\xa0 Read the whole article, and I think there\'s --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s a larger contextual point there --\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Read a couple of sentences past that and we can certainly discuss that.\xc2\xa0 But more importantly, Major, let\'s -- as I said to Chip and others, you have somebody with the vast federal judicial experience that she has, not somebody who served on the court for a year or less than a year, but somebody who served on the court for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a strong record with which to evaluate.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think we can all move past YouTube snippets and half-sentences and actually look at the honest-to-God record of these nominees -- even as April shakes her head.\xc2\xa0 I think even April will do some due diligence and come to the conclusion that the President came to, that we\'ve nominated somebody that deserves --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s out of her mouth.\xc2\xa0 Those were words that she said out of her mouth.\xc2\xa0 You can admonish YouTube.\xc2\xa0 You can admonish that and talk about her record, but she said these words.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m just asking you, Robert --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, but I\'m asking --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking you if you want to offer -- as the White House had nominated her -- something that you believe the American public should read into it or evaluate from that statement that they read that we haven\'t heard from the podium so far.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just offering you the opportunity --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, just tell me the last part again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Something that the White House wants to add to what Americans who may look at that fair-mindedly and say, this sounds to me as if there\'s a racial dimension to it, and maybe that might trouble them.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything to add to that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it -- I have confidence in Americans reading not just part of, but the whole statement, and I have confidence in Americans evaluating the full depth of her record and coming to an honest and open-minded conclusion.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In all fairness, a follow to that -- it\'s not just a racial dimension, but it\'s a gender dimension.\xc2\xa0 And do you at least acknowledge that she did say these words?\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking us to look beyond.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that it appears likely that she intoned both of those sentences, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'re spinning it, trying to make us look at the record.\xc2\xa0 Okay, we look at the record.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re also looking at her words.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say -- and I want to make sure that I get this on the record -- looking at the record isn\'t spinning you, okay.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but you\'re spinning --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what she actually said.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not spinning what she said.\xc2\xa0 If I\'m spinning what she said, April, then you at least have to acknowledge that you\'re not understanding even remotely the full context of what she said in that debate.\xc2\xa0 Right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand it, but I --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I just want to know, do you believe that in judging eight seconds, or six seconds of what somebody says in a 40-minute clip, you\'ve fully understood and taken into account the full context of what she said?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have to look at the context --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is that a spin?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but, yes, as well, you have to also see the words that she said.\xc2\xa0 You have to have a whole --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I feel confident that if you look at the context and then listen to the words, you, your listeners, and everyone that you talk to will have a greater and fuller appreciation for exactly what she said, just as I hope that people don\'t take a 10-second snippet of what you and I are talking about and form some larger conversation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, some of us have read the entire speech --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and we\'re wondering if you can explain what she meant.\xc2\xa0 Because some of us who have read the entire, lengthy speech --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I talked about this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Let me get <br/>  --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She wasn\'t saying that a Latina woman judge and a white male judge would have equal views; she said one was better than the other.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Here\'s what I believe.\xc2\xa0 I think she\'s talking about the unique experiences that she has.\xc2\xa0 I think the next sentence -- I don\'t have it in front of me -- I think the next sentence denotes that --\xc2\xa0<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We want to get it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am surprised you don\'t have it, right, April. Have you -- cue your YouTube up right there on your Blackberry. Again, I think if you look at the totality of this, if you look at the next few sentences, I have every confidence that people will come to the conclusion that -- and again, and look at her whole record.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not spinning us.\xc2\xa0 We\'re asking you, spin us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Explain what you think she meant.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have done that now --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why there is no racial component to it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- I have done that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You dismissed Newt Gingrich as not doing well enough at Princeton or doing as well as Judge Sotomayor at Princeton --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\'t think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and all he\'s saying is there\'s a racial component to it, and a fair-minded person could read that and wonder to themselves if there\'s not a racial component.\xc2\xa0 You deny that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to get an explanation as to why.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m saying -- I\'m also saying you should read all of it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you should look at the totality of -- (laughter) -- let my look denote that I\'m casting doubt on what you just said, April.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you read it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve read most of it, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what conclusion do you draw?\xc2\xa0 And what conclusion does the White House draw?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That she has different experiences than -- she has lived a different life than some people have, based on her upbringing; that she understands that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\'s okay, therefore, to say that that different life could lead you naturally to better conclusions than someone who didn\'t live that life?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or you could certainly lead to different conclusions, because we all have perspectives.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She said "better."</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, look at the totality of it.\xc2\xa0 I have confidence that people will come to a reasonable conclusion on this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Michael.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In rolling out this nomination, the President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hereby admonish everyone -- okay, I\'m sorry -- not just April.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In rolling out the nomination, the President and others in the administration have highlighted kind of the Horatio Alger aspects of Judge Sotomayor\'s life.\xc2\xa0 Why is that important in the upcoming confirmation?\xc2\xa0 And why talk about that so much?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- again, I think it provides -- I think the President talked about, in looking for somebody to fill a seat on the Court, was looking for somebody that had -- when I talk about the richness of experience, I include a life and an upbringing that are different than some people have had.\xc2\xa0 I think that provides a unique way in looking at the world.\xc2\xa0 I think it provides somebody with important perspective.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think many people in America can see some part of her -- some part of them in her story; that whether it is coming from lesser means, working hard to get through school, excelling, again, working hard as a prosecutor, as a litigator, becoming -- I forget -- I saw this somewhere, that when President Bush nominated her, I think she was the youngest judge on that -- in that district court.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I think that all of that is not only personally compelling, but I think that does give you a different way of looking at the world.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions related to Judge Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 First, there\'s just been some commentary that if she\'s confirmed she would be the sixth Catholic to serve on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering, did issues of faith come up at all in the President\'s conversations with her?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check.\xc2\xa0 The President had those conversations just with her, and staff wasn\'t there.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was her religious background given any consideration at all?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, beyond that, you talked before about getting your message out, and you\'ll convene six legal experts today, later today, to talk to reporters.\xc2\xa0 Correct me if I\'m wrong, but I think that this -- I can\'t think of another instance where the White House has convened outside experts who haven\'t -- who don\'t have a formal advisory role to the President to make your case on a particular issue.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, do you regard this as some kind of political or marketing campaign that you have to sort of convene outsiders to get your message out?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the reasoning --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Usually you just rely on me to spin people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So now you\'re bringing in -- bringing in other folks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I had to swerve and just try to go back at April one more time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">No, look, I think that -- I don\'t think this is necessarily unique.\xc2\xa0 I think we have on occasion provided experts for people to follow up with that share the same viewpoint that the President does on a particular issue.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important that we help you guys find people that have played an important role in her development or in her life or have worked with her, or people that certainly agree with the President\'s pick.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the beginning of the war room?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No -- I think this was asked yesterday -- we don\'t -- I think to have a war room denotes that we think there\'s some coming war, and we don\'t believe that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you talk a little bit about the Abbas meeting tomorrow, what\'s on the agenda and what the White House hopes to accomplish?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more specific than just the continuation of the discussions that the President started at the beginning of the administration -- one of the calls was to Mr. Abbas -- as we continue to go through and talk to leaders in the region that are involved in the very important peace talks.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll have a stronger readout on what the President conveys on that tomorrow afternoon after that meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It originally was envisioned that you were going to have three meetings.\xc2\xa0 Of course, you had Netanyahu here and you were going to have President Mubarak, who you\'re not going to see until the President gets to Cairo.\xc2\xa0 Has his absence affected the progress you\'re making?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe it has.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, again, it was a very tragic circumstance that led to that.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is anxious to have that meeting, but I don\'t think that it has materially changed where we are, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you promised -- you promised.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did I promise?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about that.\xc2\xa0 Let me continue my tour around, and we\'ll see how I am on my promise.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow, would the President like President Abbas to resume peace talks with Israel?\xc2\xa0 And just quickly, does the President believe that China has more leverage to bring to bear on North Korea than it has exerted after previous missile and nuclear crises?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the first part, obviously we were heartened to hear what Prime Minister Netanyahu said about resuming talks, and we\'re hopeful that the same goes for Mr. Abbas when we see him on Thursday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of -- I think the Chinese government has been exceptionally strong in their words of condemnation regarding the actions of North Korea over the past few days.\xc2\xa0 I think many speculated that, both in the previous test a few weeks -- well, certainly in the previous test a few weeks ago, that we would have trouble getting unanimity among the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not been the case, and I think that\'s because a lot of parties have played important and constructive roles.\xc2\xa0 I think, as was the case in 2006, the Chinese government strongly condemned the actions of North Korea as they continue to isolate themselves.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 During the process of vetting and all the papers that the President was given and seen, did he ever, out of curiosity, find himself in disagreement with Justice Sotomayor, and if so, on what cases and in what material?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t go through exactly what material he read with -- on that or what the basis would be.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he ever express any disagreement with the decisions she made?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t in front of me, but that doesn\'t mean that he didn\'t in front of others.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I\'m a glutton for punishment.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Just one question concerning what the President said in his speech on Thursday, and I quote, "I ran for President promising transparency, and I meant what I said.\xc2\xa0 This is why, whenever possible, we will make information available to the American people so they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable."\xc2\xa0 End of quote.\xc2\xa0 Do you remember that statement?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that he said that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 In consideration of this very good promise of transparency, why can\'t the President respond to the petition to requests of 400,000 American citizens by releasing a certified copy of his long-form birth certificate listing hospital -- (laughter) -- 400,000.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you looking for the President\'s birth certificate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s on the Internet, Lester.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no -- the long form listing his hospital and physician.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, this question in many ways continues to astound me.\xc2\xa0 The state of Hawaii provided a copy with the seal of the President\'s birth.\xc2\xa0 I know there are apparently at least 400,000 people -- (laughter) -- that continue to doubt the existence of and the certification by the state of Hawaii of the President\'s birth there, but it\'s on the Internet because we put it on the Internet for each of those 400,000 to download.\xc2\xa0 I certainly hope by the fourth year of our administration that we\'ll have dealt with this burgeoning birth controversy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  2:09 P.M.
