EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us on this first leg of our three-day, multi-state trip with the President.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we are headed to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the President will visit Master Lock Company, where he will discuss the importance of American manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 He will highlight insourcing and new investments in improving the skills of American workers.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMaster Lock is a great American company, as you know, the largest manufacturer of padlocks and related security products.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s leading by example and bringing jobs back to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Since mid-2010, Master Lock has returned approximately 100 jobs back to Milwaukee, Wisconsin that had previously been offshore.\xc2\xa0 Master Lock is improving productivity at their plant in Milwaukee by upgrading equipment, and the company plans to continue to bring back jobs to Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President has been highlighting a trend in America\'s manufacturing that has seen a rebound in that sector.\xc2\xa0 The sector has added more than 300,000 jobs since December of 2009.\xc2\xa0 He\'s also been highlighting a trend of insourcing, where American companies have made assessments that it is a smart economic move, smart business move for them to bring jobs back from overseas and relocate them in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something the President very much -- is a trend the President feels is healthy for the American economy and healthy for American workers and essential to building a foundation for our economic future.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is all part of the American blueprint -- the President\'s, rather, blueprint for an "America Built to Last," which, as you know, has four pillars, one of them American manufacturing; the others innovation, skills for American workers, and American values.</p>\n<p>\n\tI also wanted to just note something, if I could, that caught my attention, which is today the Department of Health and Human Services announced that the Affordable Care Act has provided approximately 54 million Americans with at least one new preventive service -- or did provide those 54 million Americans with at least one new preventive service in 2011 through their private health insurance plans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis report is particularly important given the proposal under consideration currently in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 That proposal being considered in the Senate would allow any employer to restrict access to any preventive health service they say they object to.\xc2\xa0 It is not limited to contraception, and it applies to all employers -- not just religious employers.\xc2\xa0 As the report makes clear, this proposal could affect tens of millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 And as I said yesterday, or maybe the day before, it is dangerous and it is wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert Zoellick is going to be leaving the World Bank in June.\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to Zoellick?\xc2\xa0 And has he begun vetting candidates for the post?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not know whether the President has spoken with Mr. Zoellick, and I don\'t have any information for you regarding possible successors.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that Hillary Clinton and Larry Summers could be potential successors.\xc2\xa0 Are those names that have been floated around on a staff level?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\'s been a lot of speculation in the press about this and other jobs, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to confirm any of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to Zoellick\'s decision to step down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 None beyond our obvious appreciation for his service to his country and to the international community through his work at the World Bank.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any qualities that Larry Summers and Hillary Clinton have that would make them good fits for the job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Excellent try, Kate, but I really don\'t have any information for you on potential successors at the World Bank.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Iran has announced that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to cut oil exports to six European countries in response to sanctions -- I wonder if you have a response to that, and whether you fear that this could really ultimately come back and damage the President\xe2\x80\x99s push for creating jobs and the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a couple of points on that, actually.\xc2\xa0 With regard to those threats, we don\'t know what Iran\xe2\x80\x99s intentions are, but we are watching closely and consulting with our partners.\xc2\xa0 The European Union\xe2\x80\x99s own ban on new contracts for Iranian oil imports took effect on January 23rd, as you may know, and the ban on imports under existing contracts will take effect on July 1st.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that Iran is under more pressure from sanctions than ever before, and their economy is clearly being affected by those sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But could it come back and hurt the European recovery effort and also the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s growth?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we made clear, as the President did when he signed the NDAA that included the new sanctions, that we would seek to implement those sanctions in a way that had the desired effect just to pressure and isolate Iran further, and did not have unintended consequences for any of our allies, or more broadly, for the international oil market.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing on that.\xc2\xa0 It sounded like, from what the state media is reporting, that the President of Iran has been sort of talking about a nuclear fuel reactors and things like that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you can respond to any other information you guys might have about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is apparently an announcement out of Iran today that it is loading Iranian-made nuclear fuel rods into its reactor, the Tehran Research Reactor.\xc2\xa0 We saw that announcement.\xc2\xa0 These activities remain under IAEA safeguards, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And we expect to learn more from IAEA inspectors on the ground in Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, as you know, the United States has never objected to Iran\'s peaceful and civilian nuclear activities.\xc2\xa0 In fact, back in 2009, the United States and others proposed to work with Iran to ensure a continued fuel supply for this specific reactor, which has been used to produce medical isotopes to treat cancer. After initially indicating acceptance of that offer, Iran reversed course.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our interest is in Iran abiding by its international obligations, renouncing its interest in nuclear weapons and returning to the international community.\xc2\xa0 And that path remains open to Iran as long as it is interested in talks that -- in which -- that they would approach in a constructive manner.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, both the oil move and the nuclear move could be viewed as a defiant act by Iran.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense that the sanctions are not working?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there -- does this raise questions about the effectiveness of the sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think quite the contrary, that what we see is provocative acts, defiant acts, statements that are designed to distract attention from the demonstrated impact that the sanctions are having, the demonstrated impact that the isolation of Iran is having.\xc2\xa0 We are very confident that the sanctions have put enormous pressure on the Iranian economy and on the Iranian regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is not unusual for Iran to try to distract attention from those uncomfortable facts and from its overall isolation by some burst of rhetoric or some announcement -- making some announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Associated Press is reporting that you guys are considering -- the administration is considering how to reduce the nuclear arsenal.\xc2\xa0 I understand the plan hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the President yet.\xc2\xa0 But can you talk a little bit about that consideration and what criteria the President might use to consider how to reduce the arsenal?\xc2\xa0 Is that something he would support generally?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to give you on that.\xc2\xa0 The President is extremely focused on nuclear security.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he hosted a Nuclear Security Summit in Washington.\xc2\xa0 He will be attending a Nuclear Security Summit in South Korea, and remains committed to playing the leading role -- or having the United States play the leading role in nuclear security around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Post reported that -- today that the Chinese government declined to give a visa to high-level State Department Ambassador Cook for a recent visit to talk about religious freedom issues.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 And do you have a reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department for details of that story.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that, as I noted yesterday and as others certainly did, including the Vice President, we are extremely candid in our conversations with members of the Chinese leadership about human rights and about the other issues of concern that we have in our broader relationship with China.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would note that, as you probably did, yesterday Vice President Biden said at the State Department luncheon held in honor of Vice President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit, \xe2\x80\x9cWe see our advocacy for human rights as a fundamental aspect of our foreign policy and we believe a key to the prosperity and stability of our societies.\xc2\xa0 We have been clear about our concern over the areas in which, from our perspective, conditions in China have deteriorated, and about the plight of several very prominent individuals."</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President raised the importance of human rights and America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to universal values directly to Vice President Xi during their meeting yesterday in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Specific human rights cases were raised in the course of the discussions at the White House, as was the situation in Tibet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur commitment to being candid and direct with China about issues where we don\xe2\x80\x99t agree or issues where we have concerns is part of an overall constructive approach to the relationship, which has many aspects to it.\xc2\xa0 And we are not combative or disrespectful.\xc2\xa0 We are frank and candid.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you -- to follow up on that.\xc2\xa0 The Post also reported in that story that the Obama administration asked the Ambassador and others briefed on that scenario not to talk about it in advance of the Vice President of China\xe2\x80\x99s trip here, perhaps because it would look bad.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond -- do you have any response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing on that, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view of the deal, the tentative deal in the House and the Senate to extend the payroll tax cut to deal with UI and the doc fix?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President can sign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously wait and see if there is something for leaders in Congress to announce.\xc2\xa0 As you heard the President make clear yesterday, this is an extremely high priority for him and he welcomes positive signs of progress in Congress towards ensuring that 160 million Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up on March 1st, and ensuring that unemployment insurance is extended, and ensuring that doctors who are reimbursed through Medicare don\xe2\x80\x99t have their payments slashed by something on the order of 27 percent -- the so-called doc fix.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have always believed, as the President made clear late last year and earlier this year, that Congress could -- and should -- handle this issue of extending the payroll tax cut, unemployment insurance, and the doc fix without drama and without delay.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully that is what will happen.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait and see what emerges from Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what\'s the administration\'s reaction to Assad setting a referendum for this new constitution on February 26th? Is that a positive step?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reaction to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite laughable.\xc2\xa0 It makes a mockery of the Syrian revolution.\xc2\xa0 Promises of reforms have usually been followed by an increase in brutality and have never been delivered upon by this regime since the beginning of the peaceful demonstrations in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the Assad regime\'s days are numbered.\xc2\xa0 Members of his regime, senior military and civilian leadership, are demonstrating their own faith in the future of -- or lack of faith in the future of Assad by moving assets out of the country, by preparing to send their family out of the country, and it\'s clear that Syria\'s future will not include Assad.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a question of if; it\'s just a question of when.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are working in a very focused way with an array of international allies and partners who are friends of Syria, friends of the Syrian people, to add to the pressure being brought to bear on Assad, to isolate him further, and to help bring about a peaceful transition to democracy in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right before we took off, Speaker Boehner, at a press conference, totaled up the deficits during the administration -- said $5 trillion in deficits added to the debt.\xc2\xa0 And he talked about the new budget and said, "There\'s no real activity here when it comes to cutting spending."\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that?\xc2\xa0 This budget is larger than last year\'s budget, and of course, on top of that.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your response to the Speaker?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, as you know, this budget includes more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And as part of that $4 trillion, there\'s the nearly $1 trillion in discretionary cuts that were signed into law by President Obama after negotiations with Republicans and Democrats in Congress last August.\xc2\xa0 And there is the guarantee of $1.2 trillion additional cuts that the sequester is designed to force Congress to agree on, and we hope that happens.\xc2\xa0 And then the President obviously has further reductions that come through reforms to our entitlement programs and through raising revenues on eliminating loopholes and subsidies to corporations, and raising revenues on the wealthiest Americans, who, as you know, saw their share of wealth in this country rise dramatically in the previous 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And the President does this because a balanced approach to getting our deficit and debts under control is the right way.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would simply, in response to the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s comments, marvel at his silence during the years that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor was racking up huge deficits.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that Speaker Boehner went along with policies that put two wars on a credit card, that led to the passage of a wholly unpaid-for addition to the Medicare entitlement.\xc2\xa0 He helped lead the effort to pass two massive and unpaid-for tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 These are the policies that led to -- a situation where budget surpluses were in place for as far as the eye could see in January of 2001, eight years later led to massive deficits.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s the situation President Obama inherited.\xc2\xa0 And not only that, he inherited what was the most catastrophic, devastating recession this country has had since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s policies have reversed the direction of the economy.\xc2\xa0 They have led to the creation of more than 3.7 million private sector jobs in the last 23 months, and to quarter after quarter now of economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tI understand that Speaker Boehner is opposed to almost all of those policies that have led to that economic growth and job creation, which is unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 We hope that the signs of progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the extension of the payroll tax cut might foretell cooperation in the future on measures to help the economy grow.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say a few times from the podium lately, this President does not accept the conventional wisdom that Congress can\'t get anything done in an election year.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he hopes and expects that quite the opposite will be true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has raised more money from the tech industry than from Hollywood, which is a reversal from the same period in 2007.\xc2\xa0 Do you think he might get some tough questions at these fundraisers tonight from Hollywood executives about his stance on the anti-piracy legislation, which, seemingly, the administration cast doubt on the Hollywood-supported legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe the President enjoys support from people in both industries.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, on the substantive issues of the SOPA legislation, we made our position quite clear, which was we are absolutely committed to working to find solutions to the problem of copyright infringement and intellectual property rights infringement, but we need to do it in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t restrict Internet freedom.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that\'s -- it\'s a both/and, not an either/or proposition.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach the administration is taking.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it will have any impact on fundraising in Hollywood?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign for questions about fundraising.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on China quickly.\xc2\xa0 Did either President Obama or Vice President Biden raise the issue of the blocked visa in their candid discussions yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, but I can check on that for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on a lighter note, is the President following at all the story of Jeremy Lin, the Knicks sensation -- "Linsanity," that kind of seems to be catching the world by storm?\xc2\xa0 I understand the Chinese are very interested in him as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President is an avid sports fan, and a particularly avid basketball fan, and we were speaking about Jeremy Lin on Marine One as we flew here -- to Andrews Air Force Base this morning.\xc2\xa0 If anybody caught the highlights from last night, they were pretty breathtaking.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just a great story, and the President was saying as much this morning.\xc2\xa0 It\'s obviously terrific for the New York Knicks, but it\'s the kind of sports story that transcends the sport itself.\xc2\xa0 It involves people who don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily pay attention -- I got my wife to watch the highlights this morning.\xc2\xa0 She was pretty amazed, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch basketball.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a great story.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, he\'s very impressed and fully up to speed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So had he seen --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s seen the highlights?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I know he\'s watched Lin play already, and he had seen the highlights from last night\'s game.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he called "Linsanity"?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to read out to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:45 A.M.
