Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:20 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Before I go to your questions, there is some sad news out of Canada today I just wanted to talk about briefly.\xc2\xa0 Let me begin by saying that the thoughts and prayers of everybody here at the White House go out to the families of those who were affected by today\xe2\x80\x99s shooting in Canada, as well as to the family of the soldier who was killed earlier this week.</p>\n<p>The President was briefed earlier today in the Oval Office by his top Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco.\xc2\xa0 The details about the nature of this event are still sketchy, which is not unusual in a chaotic situation like the one -- like this one.</p>\n<p>Canada is one of the closest friends and allies of the United States, and from issues ranging from the strength of our NATO alliance to the Ebola response to dealing with ISIL, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong partnership and friendship and alliance between the United States and Canada.\xc2\xa0 The United States strongly values that relationship, and that relationship makes the citizens of this country safer.</p>\n<p>Officials inside the U.S. government have been in close touch with their Canadian counterparts today to offer assistance. That includes officials here in the White House.\xc2\xa0 We have been in touch with the Canadians about arranging a phone call between the President and Prime Minister Harper at the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s earliest convenience.\xc2\xa0 He obviously is dealing with a lot today, but as soon as we can arrange that call, we\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>With that, Nedra, do you want to get us started with questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for that, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And can we talk about the announcement that\'s coming out of the CDC that there will be 21-day monitoring of people coming in from West African countries?\xc2\xa0 Is that a way to try to avoid a travel ban that some have been calling for?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s to try to put in place the kinds of policies that we believe will do the most to protect the American people and to protect the health of the American people.</p>\n<p>The President has been clear in his explanation about why he believes a travel ban is not the best policy at this point.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not philosophically opposed to a travel ban, but it is his view, based on the guidance that he\xe2\x80\x99s received from medical experts and other scientists, that putting in place a travel ban only exposes the American people to more vulnerability at this point.\xc2\xa0 Right now, because the travel lanes are open, we can have some confidence in our ability to detect those individuals who are traveling from West Africa or who have traveled recently in West Africa as they attempt to enter the United States.</p>\n<p>And because of our knowledge about their travel history, we can ensure that the screening measures that are in place in West Africa can ensure that those individuals are not exhibiting symptoms of Ebola -- there are dozens of individuals who, based on those screening protocols that are already in place, have been denied boarding -- and those individuals, when they arrive in this country are also subjected to additional screening measures, again, to determine and to confirm that they are not currently exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 This is important because Ebola can only be transmitted through the close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who\xe2\x80\x99s exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So that is the focus of our efforts.</p>\n<p>The announcement from the CDC today is an additional layer that will be based upon an effort to share information with state and local health authorities so that they can put in place measures that they believe would be most effective in protecting the populations of their states.\xc2\xa0 And that includes giving them the contact information from people who are traveling to their states so that if these state and local public health officials decide to put in place some additional monitoring provisions, that they have the wherewithal to do so, or at least they have the information that they need to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what happens if people don\xe2\x80\x99t self-report their temperatures? \xc2\xa0Would there be possibly law enforcement coming to look for them?\xc2\xa0 Would it go that far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this would be the responsibility of state and local officials in their -- in the states where these travelers are located.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, it would be the responsibility of public health officials and, in some cases, maybe even elected officials to determine what steps are needed to protect the citizens of their state.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as far as this White House is concerned, having police show up to try to find these people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be going too far, getting law enforcement involved wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be going too far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, it will be the responsibility of individual states and localities to make those kinds of decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why just these six states?\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this expanded nationwide?\xc2\xa0 Is it a matter of resources?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about are the six states where about 70 percent of the travelers\xe2\x80\x99 destination -- that essentially these are the states where the vast majority of people who have spent some time in West Africa are headed to in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that we will continue to coordinate with state and local officials to try to expand the ability to do more of this, but for details on that I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the CDC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Mr. Klain, today being his first day, can you give us a little bit more detail about what his job will entail? Like does he have a staff?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be hiring and firing? And are there any details about his salary?\xc2\xa0 Is he being paid like a senior advisor?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you some more details in terms of his salary arrangements.\xc2\xa0 He ultimately does have this responsibility to coordinate the Ebola response of the U.S. government both in West Africa but also here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 This is a coordinating function that is typical of other senior officials at the National Security Council where they are responsible for ensuring that the actions of a variety of government agencies that are focused on addressing a specific problem are properly synchronized and integrated to maximize the impact of their efforts.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially what Mr. Klain is focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the staff part, hiring and firing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any individual staffers who are reporting directly to Mr. Klain at this point, but I would anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll get the kind of support that he needs to do his very important job.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, realizing -- back to Canada -- realizing this is still a very fluid situation, are you able to say whether the United States or Canada considers this a terrorist attack?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to render judgment on that at this point.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Canadian authorities are still responding to this situation, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident they will conduct an investigation in which they will consider a range of questions not unlike the question you just asked.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication whether there is a connection to terror groups or any groups at all that you are able to say now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no conclusion like that that I\xe2\x80\x99m able to share with you at this point.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously in the very early stages of determining what exactly happened here.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned, a number of U.S. officials in this government have been in touch with their Canadian counterparts to offer some assistance as they respond to and deal with this tragic situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason for U.S. government facilities or other areas in the United States to be on high alert because of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Canada?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any decisions that have been made by individual components to change their threat status, but I know there are a number of agencies that are responsible for maintaining that threat status.\xc2\xa0 Here in the United States it\xe2\x80\x99s the Department of Homeland Security that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for maintaining the terror threat level.\xc2\xa0 There are other agencies, like the Department of Defense, that set the threat conditions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any changes, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those agencies to confirm that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said there had -- that officials are in touch with Canadian officials.\xc2\xa0 Are the FBI, the CIA offering their assistance in an investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d check with those individual agencies.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a rundown in terms of who has actually made phone calls to their Canadian counterparts, but I know that a number of officials have done that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on one other topic, can you give us any more details about how the release of Jeffrey Fowle yesterday from North Korea was arranged?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to do so from here.\xc2\xa0 You can check with the State Department and they may have more details on that.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any change to the security measures that are being taken here at the White House as a result --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but you can check with the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for maintaining the appropriate security levels here at the White House, and so if they have something to announce they\xe2\x80\x99ll be the ones to do that.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we know that U.S. law enforcement officials have been concerned about there being some kind of a raise in the threat level because of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the anti-ISIS campaign in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 Has that concern been shared with Canadian authorities?\xc2\xa0 Have U.S. and Canadian authorities been talking about this in recent weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States -- again, I just want to state that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking as a general matter here.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not ready to draw any conclusions about today\xe2\x80\x99s incident.\xc2\xa0 But that said, the United States has been in touch with Canadian counterparts over the last several months to talk about this issue of countering violent extremism and trying to deter foreign fighters who could be radicalized by ISIL.</p>\n<p>ISIL has demonstrated a capacity to use social media and other aspects of modern technology to try to radicalize citizens in other countries.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Canadians were active participants in the United Nations Security Council meeting that the President convened last month in New York that was focused on this specific issue of countering foreign fighters.</p>\n<p>I believe -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember, frankly -- we discussed this and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t check before I came out here -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall if Prime Minister Harper himself attended that meeting, but I know that the Canadians were supportive of that process and have been engaged in working with the United States on these broader efforts to counter foreign fighters.</p>\n<p>Foreign fighters, again, just to remind folks, are individuals in countries around the world that have been recruited by ISIL to travel to the region to take up arms, to get training, and to fight alongside ISIL in their cause.\xc2\xa0 The concern that the United States and other countries around the world harbors is that these individuals could return to their home countries and carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s very -- the circumstances around today\xe2\x80\x99s tragic events in Canada are still unknown.\xc2\xa0 But that is a concern that the United States has been focused on for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to other countries about steps that we can take in coordination to mitigate that threat, and Canada is one of the countries that has been robustly engaged in those efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And any response from the administration on -- to those girls, those teenage girls from Denver who apparently tried to travel to Syria to join ISIS or an Islamist group there in that region?\xc2\xa0 Apparently the girls were picked up in Germany and sent back to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 I suppose it underlines that concern that you just talked about.\xc2\xa0 Any response from the administration to that specific --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports about this particular matter.\xc2\xa0 I know that the FBI put out a statement on it, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t haven\'t anything to add to their statement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Ebola, the fact that Ron Klain starts today, it does seem as though -- that the administration had made some strides in countering this problem.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like -- does the White House feel like you\xe2\x80\x99ve turned a corner here with Ebola?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think those of you -- and, Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99re among those who have been closely watching our response here -- have noticed that there has been a stepped-up level of activity here at the federal level to deal with this issue.\xc2\xa0 That includes everything from the announcement from DHS yesterday about funneling travelers from West Africa to five airports where there already are protocols for secondary screening to occur.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an announcement from the Department of Defense about the military medical professionals that have been mobilized to be at the ready to help assist in treating Ebola patients, if necessary, here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these additional stronger protocols from the CDC about steps that health care workers can take to protect themselves when they\xe2\x80\x99re treating Ebola patients.</p>\n<p>So there have been a number of announcements from the Obama administration and from other aspects of the federal government to dealing with this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we continue to be vigilant about.\xc2\xa0 But the guidance that we have received from scientific experts about the extraordinarily low likelihood of an Ebola outbreak in the United States continues to be the operating principle here.\xc2\xa0 And it should be</p>\n<p>-- while Americans who are watching this situation recognize that their government is taking the necessary steps to do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect them, at the same time, the scientific assessment is that the risk of a widespread Ebola outbreak in the United States remains extraordinarily low, and therefore the risk to the average American from the Ebola virus remains extraordinarily low.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple of weeks ago, the Pentagon press secretary talked about the possibility of a U.S. military base in Kurdish region in the near future.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. government planning to set up any military base, or maybe more than one, in the Kurdish region?\xc2\xa0 Because there are some reports saying that the U.S. government wants to develop a greater military presence in the region in the wake of recent ISIL attacks in northern Iraq.\xc2\xa0 A source inside the Iraqi-Kurdish regional government says that U.S. government is planning to build up three military bases in the region.\xc2\xa0 One of the bases will be in Erbil, another is in Herir military base, and the third one would be in Atrush, a town close to Dohuk near the Kurdish border, according to sources.</p>\n<p>Apparently a delegation of Peshmerga and U.S. commanders visited this territory last month.\xc2\xa0 I assume that this is very strategically important because of its neighboring countries -- Iraq, Turkey, Syria.\xc2\xa0 Could you just confirm?\xc2\xa0 Is this claim true?\xc2\xa0 Or could you give us some details about the project?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m actually hearing them for the first time from you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense who can speak to our military planning efforts.</p>\n<p>I will say a couple things, though, about those reports.\xc2\xa0 The focal point of our efforts to counter ISIL has been to build up a capacity of local fighters, both in Iraq and in Syria, to take the fight on the ground to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We are prepared -- the United States and our coalition partners stand prepared to back up those efforts with military airstrikes that could make a difference on the battlefield as those local fighters confront ISIL on the ground.</p>\n<p>That is the core component of our strategy.\xc2\xa0 That is consistent with the kind of counterterrorism strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve used successfully in other countries.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to more detailed American military planning, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not aware of those specific reports.</p>\n<p>Angela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Turkish Prime Minister spoke this morning and the Defense Department confirmed that at least one of the packages of weapons that was dropped to assist in Kobani appears to have ended up in Islamic State hands.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a response to that happening?\xc2\xa0 And are there any plans to make sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen if there\xe2\x80\x99s another drop?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for the details about the specific airdrop that was carried out over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 What I have heard from them so far is that they continue to be confident that the vast majority of bundles that were airdropped did reach their target and were recovered by the anti-ISIL forces that we were seeking to assist.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of accounting for each of those bundles, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for more details about that.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go to the Department of Education.\xc2\xa0 We have now relaxed a bit some of the strict rules when it comes to the Parent PLUS loan program.\xc2\xa0 Last year, that loan program came under fire by the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as HBC presidents throughout this nation because it prohibited a lot of students from being able to go to school because their parents had blemishes on their credit reports.\xc2\xa0 So what -- does this new guideline kind of satisfy the request for the CBC as well as HBCUs in trying to bring students back to school and keep them in school so they can get an education to become middle-class Americans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them if they\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied or not.\xc2\xa0 We certainly feel good about the final rule that was issued today related to the federal Direct PLUS loan program.\xc2\xa0 These are new rules that will allow more parents the opportunity to borrow and send their kids to college, at the same time ensuring that parents are able to repay those loans and ensuring that they have the tools and resources to make informed decisions about financing the education of their children.</p>\n<p>This is consistent with other steps that the administration has taken to try to open up the door to a college education to even more students in this country.\xc2\xa0 Never before has a college education been so critical to a good middle-class job, particularly in a modern 21st century global economy.\xc2\xa0 But there are other things -- other steps the administration has taken, again, consistent with today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, like increasing the maximum Pell grant award to $1,000; creating the American Opportunity Tax Credit that makes it easier to afford a college education.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of steps that have been taken to reform the student loan program to lower costs and make more resources available to more students.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve even talked quite a bit about creating a rating system for college so that students who are considering a college education can be better informed about the offerings that are made available to them to colleges so that we can ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re choosing a college that matches their own goals and matches their financial ability to afford that tuition and not be weighed down by too much debt when the graduate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe these changes are ensuring that people are able to stay in school and get in school?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly these -- the changes that are announced today, consistent with many of the other things that the administration has done, will do even more to open up the doors to a college education to more families and students across the country.\xc2\xa0 Again, our goal here is in recognition of the fact that a college education has never been more important to being able to get and hold a good middle-class job in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Canada -- does this speak to gun control or does it speak to terrorism, or does it speak to both?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think at this point the details about what exactly has transpired there today is still under investigation, and, in fact, in some cases authorities are still responding to the incident.\xc2\xa0 So I would reserve judgment about what exactly happened or the causes of what happened until we have greater insight into what exactly happened.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s report today about the Secret Service incident in 2011.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that when he first learned of it either today or earlier this week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you -- what I would do is I would actually refer you to the statement from Secretary Johnson that he put out earlier today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s asked the Acting Director of the Secret Service, Mr. Clancy, to review the IG investigation into these specific allegations and to take the appropriate disciplinary action that he believes is necessary in this case.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that obviously has attracted the attention of senior officials at DHS, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a direct role in trying to figure out exactly who should be held accountable or what that accountability should look like?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a Director of the Secret Service who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be responsible for leading that department and making sure that appropriate accountability steps are taken.</p>\n<p>Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 In Washington, a jury convicts the Blackwater guards in 2007 Iraq deaths.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those news reports, Laura, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to discuss them from here.\xc2\xa0 But we can have somebody follow up with you on that.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I noticed in the Wall Street Journal today they reported that the Russian economy has become stagnant and that, in fact, it could be the lowest output since 2009.\xc2\xa0 Apparently the sanctions from the United States have worked in that way.\xc2\xa0 Does that make Vladimir Putin more dangerous or less dangerous?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it does make clear a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 It does make clear, as you point out, that the sanctions regime that was put in place by the United States, in close coordination with our European partners, has imposed a significant economic cost on the Russians for their inappropriate interference in the affairs of the sovereign nation of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That is an indication of a successful policy implementation.</p>\n<p>The question then goes to has it had the desired effect in terms of getting the Russians to change their behavior.\xc2\xa0 That is a calculation that only the leader of that country can make.\xc2\xa0 And we have not seen as much as we would like in terms of abiding by the terms of the ceasefire and an indication that the Russians are prepared to respect basic international norms and particularly the borders of sovereign countries.</p>\n<p>So we continue to have concerns, but it\'s also clear that the sanctions regime that the United States has put in place has taken a toll on the Russian economy and the Russians are paying a price for their actions in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the strategy to weaken Russia in this way?\xc2\xa0 Is there a possibility or is there a danger that it could actually backfire and make Putin more dangerous?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I don\'t entirely follow your thinking on this.\xc2\xa0 I think the strategy that we\'ve put in place was one that we\'ve been pretty candid about, which is ensuring that the Russians clearly understand that the international community expects that basic international norms will be respected and that the failure to do so will result in significant cost to countries like Russia that sort of flagrantly ignore those basic international norms.</p>\n<p>In this case, we\'ve seen the Russians actively support separatists in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been ample evidence to indicate that Russian supplies and even personnel have moved across the border into Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That is an inappropriate interference with the affairs of a sovereign nation.\xc2\xa0 And the Russian government and the Russian people and the Russian economy have sustained costs as a result.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you believe it\'s been a success, the sanctions have been a success?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, looking at the numbers that you cited, that is an indication that the sanctions regime has had the intended effect in terms of imposing costs on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still waiting to see whether or not those costs on the Russian economy will have an influence over the actions of Russia in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 I think the jury is still out on that part of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one question on immigration.\xc2\xa0 I know this was tried yesterday, but I\'ll give you another chance.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AP reported that there actually have been green cards printed or ordered for printing, as many as 9 million -- 5 million to 9 million.\xc2\xa0 Does that tell us anything about the President\xe2\x80\x99s intent on the number of people that he intends to make legal in this country once the election is over?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did have a chance to read those reports since yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing and before today\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 It is, I think, a relatively clever way to ask about the policy that the President has not yet announced as it relates to executive actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to take to address the problems in our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a clever answer for it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Beyond that one, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is tied to his policy then?\xc2\xa0 It suggests that he is -- but so you are suggesting then that ordering these green cards shows that the government is at least preparing for the President to announce this soon.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I would not suggest that that is an indication that that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re preparing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not denying the cards are being printed up, I guess is my question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the report is. I think the report is that they ordered some paper.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A contract to put it together.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99d cancel that contract if you\xe2\x80\x99re not planning to print a lot of green cards, I would think.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no -- Ed, what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is an order from the Department of Homeland Security to a contractor related to ongoing operations at the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for issuing green cards. I think those who are trying to read into those specific orders about what the President may decide are a little too cleverly trying to divine what the President\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion might be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On Canada, I know you said, understanding you can\xe2\x80\x99t render a judgment, it only happened a few hours ago.\xc2\xa0 However, the FBI obviously has to react, and we\xe2\x80\x99re told -- maybe you have more information.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a moment. Is it related to Canada or do you want to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 The President did connect with Prime Minister Harper just a few minutes ago.\xc2\xa0 They did have the opportunity to speak.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details in terms of a readout of that call later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The FBI obviously has to deal with the fallout of this potentially and has put out a bulletin, we\xe2\x80\x99re told, to various field offices around the United States sort of suggesting \xe2\x80\x9craise your threat posture,\xe2\x80\x9d and that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a spike in ISIS-related chatter in recent days, and intelligence officials have been picking up -- I know that does not prove that ISIS was involved in this situation in Canada, but given the fact the FBI has to prepare for that possibility, can you talk about how concerned the President may be about how the campaign against ISIS may be turned around, where ISIS may be trying to wage war not just against us but against our allies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I have not seen those FBI bulletins, nor the reports about them, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment specifically on them.\xc2\xa0 The FBI may be able to give you a better idea about what\xe2\x80\x99s motivating those bulletins.</p>\n<p>I can say as a general matter a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the United States for quite some time now has been cognizant of the threat that is posed by foreign fighters or by individuals who could be radicalized in this country.\xc2\xa0 The effort to counter violent extremism is something that the administration has been focused on for years now.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be an important priority because it\xe2\x80\x99s a critical part of our effort to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>The second thing is that the reason that the President has galvanized the international community, built this coalition of more than 60 countries to take the fight to ISIL, is because he is concerned about the risks associated with ISIL establishing a safe haven inside Syria; that if ISIL were to establish a safe haven inside Syria, it would -- or at least it could give them greater space where they could turn more of their attention to planning, plotting and organizing attacks against the United States or our allies, including even the homeland here.</p>\n<p>So the fact that ISIL poses a general threat to the United States is something that we have been aware of for some time and is, in fact, the reason that the President has worked so hard to build this broader international coalition to take the fight to ISIL and deny them the opportunity to establish a safe haven in this rather chaotic region of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two short ones on the midterms.\xc2\xa0 First, there\xe2\x80\x99s a release out today saying the Vice President is going -- both related to the Iowa Senate race.\xc2\xa0 Monday, I think the Vice President is going to Iowa.\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been there, but the First Lady has.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you a chance to talk a little bit about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s role in the midterms.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s taken some shots recently about some of his comments and whatnot. Does the White House still view him as an important asset here in some of these key Senate races?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess the important part here is, based on the way that these sorts of travel arrangements are made with the campaigns, it\xe2\x80\x99s the campaigns themselves that believe that the Vice President is an important and effective advocate for Democratic candidates across the country.\xc2\xa0 He certainly is somebody who has established throughout his career over decades a profile of someone who has woken up every morning, gone to work ready to fight for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 He did that in the Senate, he has done that in the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office, as well. I do think that gives him the kinds of credentials that are helpful to Democratic candidates across the country who are trying to make a case about the importance of an agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, a small mistake, but one that has angered Senate Democrats.\xc2\xa0 The White House put out a transcript last night about the First Lady being with Bruce Braley in the Senate race and referred to it -- referred to him as a candidate for governor.\xc2\xa0 And National Journal has a story out today quoting Senate Democratic aides saying, among other things, that -- at one point, they say that the White House political operation has gone from \xe2\x80\x9cannoying to embarrassing.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This came a couple weeks after the First Lady mispronounced Braley\xe2\x80\x99s name several times.\xc2\xa0 What does this say about Senate Democrats feeling like the White House just keeps messing up on these races?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that the First Lady was campaigning in Iowa yesterday in support of Congressman Braley\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and that the Vice President is headed there next week says all you need to know about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the success of Democrats like Mr. Braley.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just follow up, if I can, on the situation in Canada.\xc2\xa0 And again, understanding that we don\'t really know what happened there, we do know, though, that the issue of security at Parliament had been raised in particular since a vote less than two weeks ago to officially contribute to the U.S.-led fight against ISIS, and contribute fighter jets and other forms of help.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, in the context of the conversations that have been held about foreign fighters, what can you tell us about the concerns or the conversations about the possibility of retaliatory strikes against people who have joined the U.S.-led coalition?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that similar to Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question, and I think I would handle it in similar fashion, which is to say that the United States and our allies have been very mindful of the risk that is posed by foreign fighters -- again, individuals who have Western passports, who have traveled to the region to take up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 These individuals have gotten training; they\xe2\x80\x99re battle-hardened; they\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated a willingness to die for their cause.\xc2\xa0 And the risk associated with them traveling back to their home country is one that we\'re mindful of and seeking to mitigate.</p>\n<p>Canada has been robustly engaged in broader international efforts to coordinate the response to that risk, and we certainly welcome their continued cooperation on that front.</p>\n<p>The second thing I would say about that is the whole reason that the U.S., under the leadership of this President, has worked so hard to build an international coalition against ISIL is because they did pose a broader risk to the United States and our interests and our allies in the region, and there has been a concern about the risk expanding if they were able to establish a safe haven in Syria, and our efforts are motivated to denying them that specific safe haven.</p>\n<p>So this is something that we continue to be focused on.\xc2\xa0 We certainly are appreciative of the commitment that Canada has made to this broader international effort alongside some 60 other countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more specifics -- when you say that officials including White House officials are in close contact with Canadian counterparts -- any more details on who that would be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t at this point.\xc2\xa0 I just know that a number of calls have been placed, including calls here at the White House to our counterparts in Canada.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of who was on the phone, we\'ll see if we can get you some more details before the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, just one thing on the midterms -- a comment by Chris Christie that got a lot of attention when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI got to tell you the truth, I\'m tired of hearing about the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 I really am.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked in the past, though, that this really is about a bigger issue, as he and I think a lot of Republicans see it, of an opportunity gap.\xc2\xa0 Is this really reflective of the problem that the President has and is going to continue to have as he tries to fight for a minimum wage, a higher minimum wage?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll tell you there is a group of people that I do think across the country are pretty tired, and those are probably the 28 million American workers who would benefit from increasing the minimum wage to more than $10 an hour.\xc2\xa0 These are, in many cases, individuals who are raising a family of four below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that would make you pretty tired.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has worked so hard to encourage Congress to give those workers a raise.\xc2\xa0 They certainly have earned it.\xc2\xa0 It would have a substantial and beneficial impact on the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 It certainly would make a difference in the lives of those hardworking Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been pleased that there are 13 states and the District of Columbia that have acted on their own to raise the minimum wage in their jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>We certainly have been pleased to see so many private companies make similar decisions to raise the wages of their workers.\xc2\xa0 Those businesses aren\'t doing it out of charity; they recognize it\'s good for their business.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes, and this is backed up with some academic research, that raising the minimum wage would be good for the economy -- the broader economy in this country, too.</p>\n<p>Jared.\xc2\xa0 The other Jared.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t want Jared Halpern to think I was calling on him twice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 When we\'re talking about this Braley event, is it worth doing well if it\'s worth doing at all?\xc2\xa0 You said it should speak for itself that the First Lady was there.\xc2\xa0 Was this mistake and the previous mistake something that the White House regrets, the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s office regrets?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, I think anybody who heard the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday indicated -- I think anybody who heard the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday would come away with the impression that she did a good job advocating for him and motivating voters to support his campaign.\xc2\xa0 So I think it was worth doing and I think she did it well.\xc2\xa0 I think the number of people who heard her remarks is significantly higher than those of you who are closely reading the transcript.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So should Senate Democrats who were upset about this get over it, or is it something that\'s not important from the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, based on the comments that I\'ve seen from Senate Democrats, they\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to have the support of people like the First Lady and pleased that she is out on the campaign trail doing such a good job advocating for their candidates.</p>\n<p>Steven.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the Attorney General has told CNN that he\xe2\x80\x99s cautiously optimistic about the legalization of marijuana in Washington, Colorado, how it\'s going.\xc2\xa0 The new head of the Civil Rights Division, Vanita Gupta, recently (inaudible) advocating for legal marijuana.\xc2\xa0 Should we take these as signals that the President is himself continuing to evolve on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t have any update in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this issue.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like the Attorney General might be expressing his own point of view based on his own observation of the implementation of those laws in those states that you identified.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a position -- a change in position from the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective to share with you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the situation in Ottawa, does that increase the urgency of completing the Secret Service review of White House security at all?\xc2\xa0 And also, the Capitol building, the Capitol complex here is exposed.\xc2\xa0 A former Top Cop, Terry Gainer, today saying that there should be a fence around the Capitol and much more security at the Capitol.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of whether the urgency here and the security situation here should be reevaluated in light of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Ottawa?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steven, I know that there is already a pretty strong sense of urgency associated with completing the review about the security posture around the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that was further enhanced by the situation in Canada.\xc2\xa0 I just know that it was already operating at a pretty high level.</p>\n<p>As it relates to security precautions that are in place at the Capitol, I would, of course, defer to the Capitol Police, who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for protecting the Capitol for those kinds of assessments.\xc2\xa0 Here at the White House, I know that there is an effort taken to try to balance the need to preserve the White House as the people\xe2\x80\x99s house, that there are thousands of tourists that come through the White House and walk out the front door of the White House on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 There are hundreds of us who work here, including all of you, on a regular basis, and facilitating the efficient entering and exit of those of us who work here is a key priority.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, the top priority needs to be safeguarding the First Family.\xc2\xa0 And balancing those priorities is difficult.\xc2\xa0 And there is a similar dynamic in play at the United States Capitol, and I\'m confident that the U.S. Capitol Police is aware of that need and is doing everything that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to grapple with that challenge.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of recommended changes, we\xe2\x80\x99d obviously defer to them.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, is Ron Klain going to at all look at this kind of question that\xe2\x80\x99s been out there about whether you guys want more Ebola funding to come through Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s part of his portfolio, or does that kind of still reside with OMB?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that will continue to reside at OMB, but certainly, as the person that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for coordinating the government\xe2\x80\x99s response to this situation, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be included in the discussion about what, if any, additional resources are needed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99d kind of -- you said last week that you guys still haven\xe2\x80\x99t made a determination about if more resources are needed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming from your answer that that remains true.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- the Senate Appropriations Committee has said that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold a hearing on November 6th.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys expect to have a recommendation for them by that point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set a timeline on a decision that we would make on our end about additional resources.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly are -- this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at, but again, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not clear exactly how that question will be resolved.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to follow up on something you said yesterday when you spoke of an unprecedented level of transparency in --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, would you grant that it actually is an unprecedented level of transparency to ensure that reporters like yourself are admitted to fundraisers that the President convenes in private homes, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that transparency extend to the Q&amp;A sessions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even get a yes out of that, not even an acknowledgement before you asked the question.\xc2\xa0 For somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s so interested in transparency, I would anticipate that you would acknowledge where --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I acknowledge --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I stipulate your statement.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for humoring me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that transparency extend to the Q&amp;A sessions with the donors, which would be of great interest to all of us?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, right.\xc2\xa0 What we strive to do in those kinds of settings, Mark, is to balance the desire -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate one -- of the press corps to hear the President\xe2\x80\x99s pitch to donors about why they should support Democratic political committees, by and large.\xc2\xa0 There is, of course, a legitimate interest there.\xc2\xa0 And I think those who have been close observers of that process have found that the pitch that the President delivers in those more intimate settings is consistent with the pitch that the President delivers in bigger settings like campaign rallies or in fundraisers that have a much larger\xc2\xa0 -- that take place at much larger gatherings.</p>\n<p>The goal of those Q&amp;A sessions is to foster a more candid and open dialogue where you have donors who are expressing their views, and the nature of -- in some ways, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the little -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the Heidenberg Principle, right, where --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would change if we were there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Heisenberg Principle.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Heisenberg Principle.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the correction, Mr. Viquiera.\xc2\xa0 The Heisenberg Principle -- that the fact of someone observing something necessarily changes what is actually being observed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s at play in a dynamic like this where you have a relatively small group of individuals who are seeking to have a conversation with the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>So what we have done is we have structured this in a way that tries to balance your understandable interests in the pitch that the President makes to donors with the ability of donors to have a frank and candid conversation with the President of the United States in a relatively private setting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re offering the Heisenberg Principle defense to why we can\xe2\x80\x99t cover that Q&amp;A session, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s relatively creative, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you think?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but that would go to everything we cover any day.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does, which is why we try to balance them.\xc2\xa0 I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re in a setting where the President is speaking, as he was in Maryland over the weekend, to 8,000 people, it would be hard for me to make the case that letting 12 additional people observe that speech would necessarily change the interaction.\xc2\xa0 But I think the dynamic is different when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a smaller group of individuals, a couple of dozen, that increasing the number of people who are participating in that session does necessarily change the interaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t there but you released the transcript of it?\xc2\xa0 Would that mollify your concerns about the Heisenberg Principle?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that would be a different way for you to observe the interaction in a way that still would have a material impact on that kind of conversation.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because they expect privacy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That comes with the process.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that anybody expects -- there are plenty of occasions in which individuals have walked out of a fundraiser and said, I just asked the President this and he told me that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been reported.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in a position where I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that that person should be sanctioned in some way, or that they violated some sort of privacy agreement.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is an implied expectation of privacy.\xc2\xa0 I think what is implied is a little intimacy and the opportunity to have a frank and candid conversation that is different than one that\xe2\x80\x99s observed by journalists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it would be carried out differently if it were to be transcribed and released?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Since we\xe2\x80\x99re in the mood to acknowledge things, will you just acknowledge what we all suspect here, which you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to tell us -- what Ed has asked, what my colleague Mark Miller has asked you about for six years, which is the separation of costs for political travel?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to release this number, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to answer that question, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer for that, that\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not going to, right?\xc2\xa0 Just acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Much like previous administrations haven\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get to that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just acknowledge that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say -- (laughter) -- before I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go through this charade anymore.\xc2\xa0 Because I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do it, so just say you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is -- there are numbers associated with these costs that are reported to the FEC, right?\xc2\xa0 When there are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So there is a level of a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to know what they\xe2\x80\x99re for and what proportion they are of the larger whole.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So there is a level of transparency that\xe2\x80\x99s already included in the system that the Obama administration and the Democratic committees that ultimately are responsible for paying for some of these costs is reported publicly.\xc2\xa0 What I will acknowledge is this, that\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x99s not the level of transparency that you seek, but there is transparency that is built into the system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to go beyond it?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to ask the direct question --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I do not anticipate that.\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that we will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what you often fall back on in conversations with Mark and others is, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stick with the policy that previous administrations have had on this, which is not to disaggregate the numbers and to do anything more than is required by the FEC.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve told Mark for many years.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say about that is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you, why is that a defensible position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because what it\xe2\x80\x99s related to is it\xe2\x80\x99s related to the law.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the policy of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 But there are specific laws that are in place.\xc2\xa0 There are rules and regulations that govern the cost associated with presidential travel to political events.</p>\n<p>Now, what the law says is that cost associated with political activities may not be paid for by government funds.\xc2\xa0 And the HATCH Act and the FEC rules set out a very careful system to ensure that political committees pay their fair share of any travel that involves a political event, and those payments are publicly reported to the FEC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s as far as you feel you need to go to explain to the public how these costs are paid and they\xe2\x80\x99re apportioned between what the taxpayers pay for and what the political committees pay for?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This administration feels the need to diligently follow both the letter and spirit of the law, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Jim, I just want to make sure I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying about this report about the printing of the additional green cards.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that is unrelated or coincidental?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that there are decisions that are made by lots of agencies, including the ordering of specific colored sheets of paper.\xc2\xa0 Those sorts of decisions are not micromanaged by the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd with us. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not just an ordinary colored piece of paper.\xc2\xa0 It is central --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- central to what the President has promised in public to do --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also central to what they\xe2\x80\x99re already doing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also central to what they\xe2\x80\x99re already doing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked you the question.\xc2\xa0 Is it coincidental or it is unrelated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You would have to ask DHS about orders for green-colored paper that they\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The order is coming from the President.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The executive order.\xc2\xa0 But the order of the copier paper is coming from the Department of Homeland Security, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is.\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And all I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, coincidental or unrelated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You would have to ask the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you that anybody who tries to look at the order -- I mean, this is crazy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you accuse us of being clever, and that would be a rare thing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a dot that is unconnected to the underlying policy, okay?\xc2\xa0 If the President has said that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do this, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a mechanism by which it can be achieved once the executive order is put in commission, and suddenly there\xe2\x80\x99s this contract to print more of them, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just obvious that that seems to be related?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The point -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll try this one more time.\xc2\xa0 DHS currently has a responsibility for issuing green cards to individuals who are seeking to legally enter this country.\xc2\xa0 And what they will do is they will order the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it related?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- cards associated with the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- 5 million more?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, you would have to ask them about the policies that govern their procurement of green paper.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they go to Office Depot or Staples?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m really not trying to be clever.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m really trying to just be, like, as really straightforward as I can, which is the United States -- the White House does not make specific direction to agencies about which supplies they should order.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Josh, take the question seriously --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Which I do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 You would not want to be in a position, no President would want to be in a position, and no one who works for the President would want to be in a position to have the legal work that DHS has gone through and the Department of Justice has gone through to propound an executive order that the President signs and someone looks up and says, oh, Christ, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any paper for this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that.\xc2\xa0 That would irresponsible.\xc2\xa0 That would be malpractice at a procedural level, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess what I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- there are a lot of things that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- got to be prepared for an executive order that the President has said to the public he intends to sign.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is there are still decisions to be made about what that policy will entail.\xc2\xa0 And when we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to announce that policy we will announce it.</p>\n<p>What I would caution you against doing is making assumptions about what will be in those announcements based on the procurement practices of the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>Alexis.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you, Connie, if you promise that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be easy.\xc2\xa0 You can think about it a little bit -- just promise it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be easy.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple quick questions on Ebola.\xc2\xa0 The first question -- I know that you had given us an estimate of the number of travelers coming from the three West African countries.\xc2\xa0 Can you just -- in light of the CDC policy in terms of monitoring them for 21 days in six states, do you think that the number of travelers estimated is going to go down or stay the same?\xc2\xa0 Is there any government estimate of how many people will still come from those three countries into the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen a government estimate.\xc2\xa0 The current estimate is that about 150 a day enter this country from those three West African countries.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen any projections about whether or not the expectation is that that number will increase or decrease or stay the same.\xc2\xa0 You can check with either CDC or DHS to see if they have any updated projections about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you happen to know how the travelers will be informed before they come that they will be monitored in six states after they arrive?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for that, because there is obviously a visa application process for many of them and they would be responsible for notifying travelers of those kinds of requirements, I believe.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s not them it\xe2\x80\x99s probably DHS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing is, the President talked to the Prime Minister of Australia.\xc2\xa0 Ebola was a topic they talked about.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us at midweek about how the President is assessing the level of contributions to the Ebola effort in Africa and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s getting up to a level that he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling more confident about, or whether there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of work to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, and those of us here at the White House have certainly been gratified by the recent increase that we have seen in contributions.\xc2\xa0 But there is a whole lot more work to be done, and there are efforts that continue to encourage the international community to ramp up their response to this rather urgent situation in West Africa.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last question is -- over the weekend, Dr. Fauci indicated on television that he thought the United States needed more than four designated high-quality health care facilities that could handle Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything more about what the planning is to expand beyond the four, as he thought the United States needed to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You should check with CDC about that.\xc2\xa0 The efforts that they have been focused on to this point has been in offering strengthened guidance to health care workers across the country so that hospitals could have in place the procedures that were necessary to treat Ebola patients onsite.\xc2\xa0 Those resources could be augmented by this Department of Defense medical personnel that will soon be ready to deploy to support treatment efforts.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s, of course, this CDC SWAT team that is at the ready right now and ready to deploy if a patient tests positive for Ebola.\xc2\xa0 But each of these patients will be treated on a case-by-case basis, that once they are -- what we want to do is we want to make sure that hospitals across the country have the information that they need to detect, to isolate, and ultimately treat Ebola patients.\xc2\xa0 But that treatment regimen and where that treatment takes place will ultimately be sort of guided by the individual circumstances of that patient.\xc2\xa0 So decisions about what sort of protocols should be in place, what sort of experts need to be there, what sort of medicine they should be given, where that treatment should take place are all the kinds of decisions that will be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on decisions that are made by the doctor and the condition of the patient.</p>\n<p>Leslie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, at the risk of going over stuff you talked about last week -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here -- in terms of the Ebola czar and sort of going from outside to get somebody, you said that the President wanted someone who could do it 100 percent of the time. Why not pick somebody from within?\xc2\xa0 Since Ron Klain has gotten some criticism for not having public health experience, why not pick somebody from within the Cabinet or the executive branch who could be -- do it 100 percent of the time?\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that it sort of reflects some uneasiness with the executive branch able to pull off something like a czar position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think what it reflects is it reflects that there are a lot of other executive officials here in the executive branch, including at the Cabinet level, that have very important responsibilities that they\xe2\x80\x99re already working on.\xc2\xa0 And the President felt like it was important for someone who had the kind of management chops that Ron Klain does both inside the government and in his tenure in the private sector to focus 100 percent of his time on this urgent issue.</p>\n<p>And, frankly, if we were taking somebody else off of another priority to focus on this, then we\xe2\x80\x99d just have to find somebody to replace them in doing the task they were previously focused on.\xc2\xa0 So it made sense in this case to bring in somebody from the outside who had extensive experience in the federal government, who had strong management credentials from the private sector, and deploy them to spend 100 percent of their time coordinating the government\xe2\x80\x99s response to this situation.</p>\n<p>Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just a quick one on Ebola and then following up on Major.\xc2\xa0 On the military team that was stood up or announced on Sunday and is standing up to augment the request at HHS, was the President involved in that decision?\xc2\xa0 And does it reflect sort of a change in the President\xe2\x80\x99s confidence level in the civilian medical teams that are handling Ebola, that there needs to be a military sort of standby readiness team to deal with any sort of domestic outbreaks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what it reflects is it reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s team following up on his directive to pursue a whole-of-government approach to this response.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, the government sought out resources that were available inside the federal government that could be used to assist hospitals across the country as they potentially are in a position to treat Ebola patients.\xc2\xa0 So I think this is an example of the President and his team being resourceful and seeking out available expertise that already existed inside the federal government and deploying it in a way -- or at least making it available to be deployed in a way that would benefit the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And following up on Major\xe2\x80\x99s line of questioning regarding the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel for political fundraisers, would you concede that this is one area where this administration has -- the most transparent administration in history -- has not increased the level of transparency in what the President -- what Democratic committees pay and what taxpayers pay for the President to go travel for political events?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If you will cite at the same time one example of where this administration has exceeded the transparency standards of previous administrations --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- fundraisers, that\xe2\x80\x99s already been stipulated.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at least the opening remarks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Previous administrations have had the full pool into private home fundraisers.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, repeatedly, myself.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not consistently, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that this administration has done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re pointing out these sort of transparency -- the FEC only reports a very small window into how much is paid here and --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I will concede is that the policy that we have pursued is entirely consistent with both the spirit and letter of the existing law, and is consistent with the policies that were followed by previous administrations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office that makes the\xc2\xa0 determination between what is political, what isn\xe2\x80\x99t, what the proper ratios for these trips.\xc2\xa0 And if the White House is so confident in its following the letter of those laws, why not open the books and let the American people see it?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the downside for the administration if you\xe2\x80\x99re following the law?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this case, we are following the law.\xc2\xa0 That is disclosed by the FEC.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a downside or not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there\xe2\x80\x99s an upside, either.\xc2\xa0 But there is a specific --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Accountability is the upside.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I think there is accountability in terms of following both the spirit and letter of the law, and particularly when it comes to the disclosure of those sums of money.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it follow the spirit of a promise by a President for the most transparent administration ever?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal for American fighters to go over and fight for ISIS, certainly, but fighting on the other side -- is that an act of treason?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You probably have to consult a lawyer in terms of figuring all that out.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like it would be, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not an attorney so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hazard a guess.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you check and let us know, please?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just check with the Department of Justice and maybe they can give you a legal conclusion there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. getting adequate intelligence assistance from its allies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly value the kind of counterterrorism partnership that we have with members of our coalition and with countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 Those sorts of strong working relationships and partnerships are critical to American national security, and we have worked aggressively to try to strengthen those partnerships.\xc2\xa0 And they certainly contribute to the safety and security of the American people and our allies around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you explain why you said Mark\xe2\x80\x99s statement was not true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because we put in place a policy, at the request of the press corps, who came to us and said at the beginning of the administration that reporters in the White House Press Corps would like to have greater access to events in private homes that they previously did not have access to.\xc2\xa0 And so we agreed to put in place a policy where consistent access to those remarks would be granted, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done since the first day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Mark told you he had been in previous administrations --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not my understanding of the previous policy.</p>\n<p>Thank you, guys.\xc2\xa0 Have a good day.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:20 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
