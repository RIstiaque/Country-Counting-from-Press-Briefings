EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One this morning, as we make our way out to sunny California for what will I\xe2\x80\x99m sure be a terrific trip, largely focused on the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, official announcements.\xc2\xa0 Maybe Jen has something to start with.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So before we get started, I just wanted to go through some simple \xe2\x80\x9cback of the notecard\xe2\x80\x9d math on how we get to the $5 trillion.\xc2\xa0 And I was not a math major, I was an English major.\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, this is something any American can do, so just bear with me here.\xc2\xa0 I know this is hard to see, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll read through it.</p>\n<p>So lowering the rates, as Mitt Romney has said he would do, to 20 percent -- $2.7 trillion over 10 years; eliminating the AMT -- $700 billion; repealing high-income payroll tax -- $300 billion; ending estate tax -- $150 billion; lowering the corporate rate from 35 to 25 -- $1.1 trillion.\xc2\xa0 That adds up to $4.8 trillion.\xc2\xa0 If you factor in interest for additional borrowing, you get to $5 trillion.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep in mind also the things that Mitt Romney have said are off the table.\xc2\xa0 We know he, one, says it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be revenue-neutral.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s taken off the table tax breaks for savings and exemptions -- for savings and investments; exemptions, which includes capital gains, of course; exemptions for both IRAs and 401Ks.\xc2\xa0 So those are things that he will not be touching.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0And if you were to add up eliminating all of the high-income tax breaks, all tax breaks across the board for high-income individuals, as he said he would do, that still only gets you to $2.7 trillion.\xc2\xa0 Nobody thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do that.</p>\n<p>Last point I\xe2\x80\x99ll make is the Tax Policy Center also gives him the benefit of the doubt and says he will raise $1.1 trillion by eliminating loopholes, none of which he said which ones they will do.\xc2\xa0 That still only gets you to $3.8 [trillion].\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s with using -- giving the absolute benefit of the doubt.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the simple math.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to send this to anyone.\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to get that off the table to start with.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I have a big picture question about where both campaigns are going -- and this is part of that, the $5 trillion debate.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk now about dishonesty.\xc2\xa0 Your campaign thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s being dishonest about not having this $5 trillion plan.\xc2\xa0 The Romney folks think that they can do what they say without hurting the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that this is the kind of debate the American people want right now 30 days out -- who\xe2\x80\x99s being dishonest?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The $5 trillion tax debate is not about honesty and dishonesty.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about what your priorities are and who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a better fighter for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So the reason that\xe2\x80\x99s so important is because the $5 trillion tax cut plan is the big idea Mitt Romney has put forward -- tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 The Tax Policy Center, independent economists have said the only way to do that, the only way to pay for that, as I just showed, is by either blowing a hole in the deficit or raising taxes on middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a difference in priorities, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an indicator of who each of the candidates would be fighting for in the White House.</p>\n<p>We know that elections are tough, and Mitt Romney himself even said during the primary campaign, elections are tough.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep laying out the facts for the American people, the facts about the differences between their policies.\xc2\xa0 And we feel that\xe2\x80\x99s pivotal in the final 30 days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, we got your fundraising figures yesterday for the month of September.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign made a point of saying that they had a big increase in fundraising after the debate -- $12 million or something in 48 hours.\xc2\xa0 Did the Obama campaign also have an influx in fundraising after the debate?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I will just emphasize that one of the pieces that we\xe2\x80\x99re so proud of, of our fundraising numbers, is that we brought more than a half a million new donors into the system who -- into our campaign, who had never contributed before, with an average donation of $58.\xc2\xa0 Ninety-eight percent of donations were under $250.\xc2\xa0 This is just further confirmation that our campaign is funded by grassroots donations, by people across the country who are giving $3, $5, $10 whenever they can.</p>\n<p>I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the numbers from the Romney team yet, but I would be surprised if their numbers show that their campaign is funded by low-dollar grassroots donors like ours is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it still the position of the campaign that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be outspent? \xc2\xa0I mean, given these huge sums of money, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all irrelevant at this point?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve long said that\xe2\x80\x99s what we expected.\xc2\xa0 We obviously were outraised a couple of months this summer.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the Romney team\xe2\x80\x99s numbers are.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused at this point, and always have been, on running our own race and making sure that we have the resources to fund the largest grassroots campaign in history.\xc2\xa0 And for us, that means making sure we are able to open the number of offices we wanted to open, have the number of staff on the ground that do the GOTV that we wanted to do, and communicate directly with the American people.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve always said we would have the resources to do that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still confident we are.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously out here and making this trip because we don\xe2\x80\x99t take anything for granted and we don\xe2\x80\x99t count our chickens before they hatch.\xc2\xa0 And we still need every last dollar to compete against the enormous amount of special interest super PAC money that is being thrown into the race on the Republican side.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us about who President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s friend was who de-boarded Marine One and came onto Air Force One with him?\xc2\xa0 Who is that?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a new debate coach.\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Mike Ramos is a longtime friend of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s traveled with him many times before.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s probably been in pool reports you all have read before, so he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling with him on this trip.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he from Hawaii -- is it Chicago?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where he\xe2\x80\x99s from originally.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll find out for you.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s been written about much -- very frequently in the past.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also talk to us about tonight\xe2\x80\x99s event -- the first event, which is closed press?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of unusual.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a fundraising event.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about what it is?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We have actually done meetings or events with high-dollar donors who have maxed out or contributed a high amount to the campaign around other events before.\xc2\xa0 So this is one of those events; it\xe2\x80\x99s a thank-you event for a small group of donors.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton will be there with the President.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton also has an event tomorrow morning that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing that I believe I sent you all information on.\xc2\xa0 The cost for -- the tickets for those started at about $1,000.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just an opportunity to thank donors who have been there with us.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Bill Clinton speak as well as President Obama?\xc2\xa0 Do they make informal remarks instead of formal remarks?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very small group of people; it\xe2\x80\x99s only about a dozen people.\xc2\xa0 So typically, it\xe2\x80\x99s just around a table or in a small room, and no formal program.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if there was, that would be something we\xe2\x80\x99d all be discussing and litigating.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s much more informal than that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us about who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list and as you know, we don\xe2\x80\x99t release lists of people attending fundraisers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to us about -- even though it\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow, about tomorrow -- maybe, Jay, this is a question for you about the Ch<em>\xc3\xa1</em>vez event.\xc2\xa0 Policy-wise, what\xe2\x80\x99s the important of it?\xc2\xa0 And politics-wise, what\xe2\x80\x99s the significance of him going there to announce this memorial for C<em>\xc3\xa9</em>sar Ch<em>\xc3\xa1</em>vez?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On October 8th, tomorrow, the President will travel to Keene, California to announce the establishment of the C<em>\xc3\xa9</em>sar E. Ch<em>\xc3\xa1</em>vez national monument.\xc2\xa0 Years in the making, the monument, which will be designated under the Antiquities Act, will be established on the property known as La Paz.\xc2\xa0 Nuestra Se\xc3\xb1ora Reina de la Paz, or Our Lady Queen of Peace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Check out that accent.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A little high school Spanish.\xc2\xa0 The La Paz property is recognized worldwide for its historic link to civil rights icon, C<em>\xc3\xa9</em>sar Estrada Ch<em>\xc3\xa1</em>vez, and the farm worker movement.\xc2\xa0 The site served as the national headquarters of the United Farm Workers, as well as the home and workplace of C<em>\xc3\xa9</em>sar Ch<em>\xc3\xa1</em>vez and his family from the early 1970s until his death in 1993.\xc2\xa0 It includes his gravesite, which will be part of the monument.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will honor C<em>\xc3\xa9</em>sar Ch<em>\xc3\xa1</em>vez\xe2\x80\x99s memory with -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll honor C<em>\xc3\xa9</em>sar Ch<em>\xc3\xa1</em>vez\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and what the American people can take away from this new national monument from a civil rights icon who gave a voice to poor and disenfranchised workers everywhere.</p>\n<p>Going to your question, this is the fourth, I believe, designation under this President, under the Antiquities Act, of a national monument.\xc2\xa0 The process of doing that is a multi-year process.\xc2\xa0 This has been in the works for several years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Participating in the event tomorrow will be Secretary Salazar, who oversees the National Park Service, as well as Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis, who first introduced a bill in Congress several years ago for the purpose of establishing this national monument.\xc2\xa0 Los Angeles Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, will also be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the $5 trillion tax debate, is that something that we can expect to hear Vice President Biden pursue in a much more aggressive way in this week\xe2\x80\x99s debate, given the high profile setting that will be a nationally televised debate?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too ahead of what topics we think will come up.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, the Vice President and Congressman Ryan have both had time debating and discussing and laying out the case for their very different approach to policy issues.\xc2\xa0 The question for Congressman Ryan is, will he go to the debate and stand for the policies that he and Mitt Romney have been advocating for -- voucherizing Medicare, a $5 trillion tax cut package that benefits millionaires and billionaires, and leaves the burden on the back of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Or will he, as Mitt Romney did last week, hide from his policies and be dishonest about what he represents.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see later this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the stakes higher for him, given what was reviewed -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s performance -- are the stakes higher for Biden this week?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that they\xe2\x80\x99re both looking -- I know the Vice President is looking forward to having a policy debate about the differences between the platforms of the two candidates, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s happy to talk about the $5 trillion tax cut package the Romney/Ryan team has been fighting for, if given the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, we heard from the campaign there will be adjustments to the President\xe2\x80\x99s debate strategy after the last one.\xc2\xa0 How does that debate inform how Vice President Biden might debate?\xc2\xa0 Is there any connection?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we learned earlier this week is that Mitt Romney -- the Mitt Romney who came to the debate is one who has a strange relationship with the truth.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Paul Ryan is going to go to the debate this week and talk about the issues they\xe2\x80\x99ve been -- he\xe2\x80\x99s been advocating on the campaign trail, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s voucherizing Medicare or extending tax cuts for the highest income.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Vice President will certainly be prepared to lay out the facts as we have been doing over the past couple of days.\xc2\xa0 So in that way, it\xe2\x80\x99s informed us.\xc2\xa0 The President knows what kind of debater Mitt Romney is and the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to say and do anything on a national stage in order to win the presidency.\xc2\xa0 And so we take that into account as we prepare for future debates.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the President, irrespective of the first debate, in general, does the President work with Vice President Biden in a case like this to go over debate?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that a natural part of their conversations?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if they\xe2\x80\x99re having conversations.\xc2\xa0 As you know, they speak on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously going to be out campaigning quite a bit this week.\xc2\xa0 But the Vice President has been preparing, his team I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, and watched the debate as did he.\xc2\xa0 So I think they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty clear what the approach of Mitt Romney was, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach Paul Ryan takes later this week.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama doing any debate prep during this fundraising swing in California?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 He has a pretty busy schedule, as he has been doing.\xc2\xa0 He may take some time to review materials, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific scheduling updates for you on his debate prep.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a five-hour flight each way.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 It could be.\xc2\xa0 We just started the flight, so as of now I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing during the flight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, Governor Romney is going to give a big foreign policy speech tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what your view is on the timing of his speech and also how the President and the campaign plans to counter that, given that he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to talk about Iran and Syria and Libya, some things that are in the news?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So, one, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be lectured by someone who has been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he\xe2\x80\x99s dipped his toe in the foreign policy waters.\xc2\xa0 Just as a refresher, this is the same guy who, when he went overseas on his trip, the only person who has offended Europe more is probably Chevy Chase.\xc2\xa0 And that was a trip that was built up.</p>\n<p>Second is when he had the opportunity to speak directly to the American people about his plans on domestic and foreign policy issues, as we all remember, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring up Afghanistan, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring up the troops.\xc2\xa0 He has been abundantly clear that he would not have gone after Osama bin Laden in Pakistan; has failed to lay out his exact differences on Iran, as much as he said he has an entirely different position from the President.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly interested in what he has to say, but this is his fourth or fifth retake at trying to lay out his foreign policy positions for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very high bar he would have to jump over to convince them he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to be Commander-in-Chief and to address all of the foreign policy challenges you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you plan to counter it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, with the campaign, or will the President speak to that himself?\xc2\xa0 I mean, one of the things he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to talk about are a lot of the questions surrounding the administration\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the Libya attack on 9/11.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s in his speech yet, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that we will have a substantive response from the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what he has to say, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll respond accordingly.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we had a story out this morning saying that the U.S. has agreed to allow South Korea to have longer-range missiles that could reach all of North Korea, which obviously raises the potential of an angry reaction from the North.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to this and why the U.S. has taken this position?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, as you know, the United States works very closely with the Republic of Korea on a wide range of security issues.\xc2\xa0 As partners whose alliance is a linchpin of stability in northeast Asia, we take seriously our mission of maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.\xc2\xa0 The United States remains firmly committed to our Alliance and to the defense of the Republic of Korea.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0In this context, we have been in discussions with the Republic of Korea, at its request, on ways to address the threat posed by DPRK ballistic missiles.\xc2\xa0 Based on those consultations, the Republic of Korea has announced revisions to its missile guidelines as well as additional improvements to Alliance capabilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The ROK\xe2\x80\x99s new missile guidelines are designed to improve the Republic of Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ability to defend against DPRK ballistic missiles.\xc2\xa0 The revisions are a prudent, proportional, and specific response to the DPRK.</p>\n<p>I would just say that we are in regular consultations with the Republic of Korea on these matters, and the reason that these new guidelines were established -- or were designed, rather, was in response to the DPRK ballistic missile threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern, though, even given the reasons that you just stated, that this could lead to some sort of escalation of tensions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the international community has made clear its concerns about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s missile activities.\xc2\xa0 The United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 call on the DPRK to suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program.\xc2\xa0 However, the DPRK continues to seek improvements to the range and effectiveness of its ballistic missiles.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The onus here is on North Korea, as it has been, to abide by its international obligations to fulfill its obligations under two United Nations Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is absolutely legitimate for the Republic of Korea to take actions in consultation with the United States to respond to a threat posed by the DPRK\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a lot of stuff has happened since the debate last night, including the unemployment numbers and the fundraising numbers.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, would you assess, from a campaign standpoint, that you are about the same, weaker, or stronger than you were going into the debate last week?\xc2\xa0 And how will that affect your approach this week going ahead?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, even before the debate, we always thought this race was going to be close.\xc2\xa0 We still believe that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the American people say and how the polls respond to the events that you just listed of last week.</p>\n<p>Our focus is not looking at the ups and downs, or evaluating day to day -- we\xe2\x80\x99re at an eight today, we\xe2\x80\x99re at a seven today, we\xe2\x80\x99re at a six -- whatever it may be; it\xe2\x80\x99s keeping on our game plan, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re out here fundraising the next two days.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to Ohio State.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the last day of voter registration in Ohio.\xc2\xa0 The President will be making a firm call for the students to go immediately from the rally and go register and to early vote as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So just as we weren\xe2\x80\x99t two weeks ago getting wrapped up in the ups and downs, in the day-to-day polls, we\xe2\x80\x99re still not now.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re just focused on making sure we\xe2\x80\x99re getting our message out, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting all our people out to early vote, and we\xe2\x80\x99re reaching our goals on that level.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I could just pull it out of the campaign day to day and look at it as a matter of policy, what was important about the jobs report we saw Friday was that it was evidence that we are moving forward.\xc2\xa0 We have a long way to go, but it was another piece of evidence that demonstrates that the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to building the economy from the middle out is the right approach, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>And I think it is very important to remember, both on domestic policy and on foreign policy, that the alternative approach put forward by Republicans in general, including Governor Romney, has been to take us backward to the policies that helped get us in this mess.</p>\n<p>To your point on foreign policy, Carol, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that Governor Romney was, like Republican leaders both in Congress and outside Congress, fully supportive of the approach that President Bush took, which might explain why Governor Romney believes that ending the war in Iraq was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He was fully supportive of the approach in the previous administration in Afghanistan that saw that effort, where we were taking the fight directly to those who attacked the United States, was adrift and underfunded and under-resourced.\xc2\xa0 The President promised to reverse that.\xc2\xa0 He did it.\xc2\xa0 He took the fight to al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 He increased our resources and sharpened our mission in Afghanistan, and he is now -- has begun the process of ending that war in Afghanistan, as he promised.</p>\n<p>On domestic policy, I covered the 2000 campaign.\xc2\xa0 I remember the promises of what multi-trillion-dollar tax cuts would do for the American economy and the American middle class.\xc2\xa0 We all saw what happened through those eight years, and what the middle class has endured.\xc2\xa0 We all saw a President who took office in 2001 inherited a surplus that was supposed to be in place as far as the eye could see; eight years later, bequeathed upon President Obama a $1 trillion deficit.\xc2\xa0 We saw what deregulation did and allowed in terms of Wall Street being able to write its own rules, and what that helped create -- the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p>We cannot go back, and as a matter of policy, this President is committed to moving forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 12:31 P.M.
