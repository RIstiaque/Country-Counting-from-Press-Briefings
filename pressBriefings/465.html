Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Apologize for the delay.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working out some scheduling kinks here.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get better, I promise.\xc2\xa0 Let me do a quick topper here and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.</p>\n<p>This afternoon, the President will participate in a live Q&amp;A with Tumblr -- no \xe2\x80\x9ce\xe2\x80\x9d --- (laughter) to continue to talk about the importance of making college more affordable for current students, graduates, and their families, and the new executive actions that he announced yesterday to further that goal.\xc2\xa0 This is the first-ever live White House Q&amp;A with Tumblr, which has a very wide reach among young people.\xc2\xa0 About 40 percent of Tumblr\xe2\x80\x99s more than 350 million monthly users are between the ages of 18 and 34.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This event is part of a weeklong message push the President is doing to highlight the steps he is taking to offer relief to Americans who are working hard to pay back their student loans, and to urge Congress to pass legislation to help more young people save money by refinancing their federal student loans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Earlier today, our Council of Economic Advisers and Domestic Policy Council released a report showing the impact of crushing student debt on young Americans and our economy, and new data showing how borrowers in each state would benefit from both the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions and the Senate Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 bill.\xc2\xa0 For example, in my home state of Missouri, we estimate that over 110,000 additional borrowers would be able to cap their monthly student loan payments under the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPay As You Earn\xe2\x80\x9d proposal.</p>\n<p>Our DPC Director, Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz, and the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, will hold a press call on this report later today.\xc2\xa0 And you can contact the press office for more information about how to participate in that call.</p>\n<p>So with that, Julie, do you want to get us started with questions today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Five Americans were killed in Afghanistan in what appears to be a coalition airstrike, friendly-fire incident.\xc2\xa0 And I know there was a brief statement from NSC, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the administration has any more detail on exactly how this happened this morning.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie, our thoughts and prayers here at the White House are with the families of those who were killed in Afghanistan earlier today.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense is still looking into what exactly happened, and it will be their responsibility to determine what actually led to their deaths.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to hold off on weighing in any further, pending that investigation of what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 But it is true that our hearts here at the White House are heavy as a result of this loss.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I assume the President has been briefed on what is known at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has been informed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if we could move to Iraq, Islamic militants have overrun the city of Mosul.\xc2\xa0 What responsibility does the U.S. have to help the Iraqi government regain control there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that the United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\xe2\x80\x99s aggression in Mosul.\xc2\xa0 It has led to a serious deterioration of the security situation in that city and in Nineveh Province.\xc2\xa0 ISIL gained strength from the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 This threat exemplifies the need for Iraqis from all communities to work together to confront this common enemy and isolate these militant groups from the broader population.\xc2\xa0 The situation is extremely serious, and U.S. officials in both Washington and Baghdad are tracking events closely in coordination with the government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States will continue to stand with the Iraqi people and provide all necessary and appropriate assistance to the government of Iraq under the Strategic Framework Agreement to assist it in our common fight against the threat that ISIL poses to Iraq and the broader region.</p>\n<p>So, from there, I think you can conclude that this administration is committed to preserving the partnership that we have with the Iraqi government, that there is some assistance that we can provide and have been providing, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re also urging the government to take additional steps that will make it clear that they are governing that country with the interests of all Iraqis in mind.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an important priority as well.\xc2\xa0 And that is an important part of countering this violent extremist aggression that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in some parts of that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be more specific about what kind of assistance the U.S. is working on as it relates to this current situation?\xc2\xa0 And again, does the U.S. feel any special responsibility to assist the Iraqi government given our very recent history with Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do have some details here.\xc2\xa0 Our shipments, in terms of assistance to Iraq, have included the delivery of 300 Hellfire missiles, millions of rounds of small arms fire, thousands of rounds of tank ammunition, helicopter-fired rockets, machine guns, grenades, flares, sniper rifles, M16s and M4 rifles to the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s all before today\xe2\x80\x99s incident, correct?\xc2\xa0 This is not in response to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 And what this is -- this is an illustration of the kind of military-to-military relationship we have with the government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in terms of our relationship with them, it\xe2\x80\x99s an important one, but it\xe2\x80\x99s governed by the Status of Forces Agreement Strategic Framework Agreement.</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99re also in a position to encourage all Iraqi leaders, including Prime Minister Maliki, to do more to address unresolved issues to better meet the needs of all the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work consistently with Iraqi leaders from across the political spectrum to encourage a government that effectively addresses unresolved issues; that like so many things that we are challenged to deal with in terms of American foreign policy, these kinds of solutions don\xe2\x80\x99t have a solely -- or these kinds of challenges don\xe2\x80\x99t have a solely military solution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So while we can provide important military assistance to improve the security situation in Iraq, addressing these challenges is going to require a commitment by the Iraqi leadership, including Prime Minister Maliki, to confront the kinds of unresolved issues that are facing all of the people in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Continuing on Iraq, is what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there a civil war?\xc2\xa0 Is this is a civil war in Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a pronouncement that I would make from this podium.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned at the beginning, this is a situation that is very serious and one that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about.\xc2\xa0 It is clear that there are some very serious security challenges in Iraq that have deteriorated in an important way recently.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue our important relationship in terms of providing some security and military assistance to the government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s also a responsibility on the part of the Iraqi leaders to step up to the plate here.\xc2\xa0 That includes Prime Minister Maliki to do more to address the unresolved issues and better meet the needs of the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the issue of Sergeant Bergdahl, Congressman Greg Walden said that the administration had briefed as many as 90 people within the administration but not a single member of Congress, and complained about that yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is that an appropriate way to deal with Congress on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re assuming that what he said is accurate.\xc2\xa0 Let me start with this to clarify what exactly that 80 to 90 number refers to.\xc2\xa0 This number originated in a classified briefing that was provided to House members yesterday on the efforts to recover Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 So that 80 to 90 number was then subsequently read out by some House members who had attended at least part of that briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So let me clarify what exactly the administration officials were talking about when they referred to that 80 to 90 people.\xc2\xa0 They were referring to individuals in the administration that had access to intelligence related to the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Qatar.\xc2\xa0 Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the negotiations that were conducted by the administration to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl were facilitated by the Qatar government, that they were essentially the intermediaries in this transaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say it again, what you just said -- the 80 to 90 people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That this 80 to 90 people had access to intelligence related to Taliban activities in Qatar.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But 85 to 90 did not know about the possible deal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting to here.\xc2\xa0 There was a smaller number of individuals who were aware of specific military actions, including the one related to the transfer of Sergeant Bergdahl out of Taliban captivity and into American custody.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simple:\xc2\xa0 This is a secret military mission in which disclosure of the mission could put into jeopardy not just the life of Sergeant Bergdahl, but also the lives of the American servicemen who were involved in the mission.\xc2\xa0 So discretion on this matter was important, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the number of people who were aware of this military operation in advance was even smaller than 80 to 90.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And different topic entirely -- the President has made his second off-campus outing in as many days today.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does he have senioritis, as some have suggested?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President thought it was a beautiful day to go out to lunch, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And joking aside, is it your sense that people will pay more attention to the President when he does off-campus things like this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think people pay a lot of attention to what the President does.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is going to lunch with the Secretary of Education to seek attention.\xc2\xa0 I think he is going out to lunch with the Secretary of Education to seek a nice meal.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk a lot himself about his own desire to try to break outside of the White House bubble, to get off the 18 acres that make up the White House complex.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been looking for opportunities to do that recently. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 He traveled to a little league baseball game in Northwest Washington, where he stopped off on the way to a political event.\xc2\xa0 The President also recently walked over to the Department of the Interior when he had a public event over there and he had the opportunity to greet some tourists who happened to be in town.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These were events that the President genuinely enjoyed.\xc2\xa0 He was pleased to have the chance to get outside of the bubble a little bit and to shake some hands and to visit with some folks.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he enjoys doing, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he -- it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that he enjoyed a lot about the campaign, both his first campaign for President but also his reelection campaign, was that it afforded him the opportunity to spend a lot of time with -- outside of the gates of the White House.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re looking -- he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for opportunities to do more of that now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the bubble go with him, Josh?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To a certain extent, it does.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between sitting in the Oval Office and being able to go out to a restaurant or somewhere else and have the chance to shake hands and bump into people, and to sort of be off of a specific, regimented schedule that does govern a large portion of his day.\xc2\xa0 But my sense is, is that the reason that the President goes out to lunch with a colleague -- in this case, the Secretary of Education -- is for many of the same reasons that you yourself might choose to go out to lunch with one of your colleagues.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve just been talking about concerning Congress notification and Bergdahl, do you think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a concern that what has happened here has eroded or will erode support among Democrats in Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other quick question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 How about that for a direct answer, huh?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I love it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration trust Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, it only goes so far, right?\xc2\xa0 Let me elaborate on that.\xc2\xa0 This administration has demonstrated on a variety of topics a commitment to consulting with Congress.\xc2\xa0 There is a responsibility that Congress has that\xe2\x80\x99s laid out in the Constitution of the United States to advise and consult the executive branch on a wide range of topics -- everything from presidential appointments to the appointing of federal judges and, in some cases, matters relating to national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The responsibility to communicate and coordinate and consult with Congress is one that this administration takes seriously.\xc2\xa0 And there was a lot of conversation about this last summer -- that the President believes that our foreign policy priorities are strengthened when there is a public demonstration of a bipartisan commitment to those priorities.\xc2\xa0 So we seek opportunities to work in collaborative fashion with Democrats and Republicans on a range of issues, including national priorities -- national security priorities that the President himself has identified.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we were just talking about Americans killed overseas -- well, a lot of Americans have been killed in the last few days and weeks on American soil.\xc2\xa0 And the President really wanted to -- I think it was in the State of the Union, he pledged to do something about guns, even without Congress.\xc2\xa0 So do you feel like those executive actions have really done anything?\xc2\xa0 And is there a plan to try to do more?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what exactly, but something.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at the beginning of last year, at the beginning of 2013, the administration did roll out 23 specific executive actions.\xc2\xa0 These were steps that the President and Vice President identified where specific administrative action that could be pursued by the administration could have a positive impact in trying to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve, I think, been pretty upfront about two things.\xc2\xa0 One, that those administrative actions were in no way a substitute for robust congressional action.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of commonsense measures that have strong bipartisan support that could be taken to reduce gun violence without infringing on Second Amendment rights that the President is committed to defending.</p>\n<p>Secondly, even that robust congressional action is not going to prevent every single terrible thing from happening.\xc2\xa0 And there is no doubt that there has been an alarming frequency of tragic incidents of gun violence that are concerning to Democrats and Republicans in Washington but, more importantly, to people all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I think the question is not what can we do to make sure that something like this never, ever happens again.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be other tragedies.\xc2\xa0 But the question I think really facing lawmakers right now is, what commonsense steps can Democrats and Republicans take to reduce the likelihood of gun violence?\xc2\xa0 And there are some, and they have unfortunately been bottled up in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that is a disappointment to the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that is not going to stop the President from continuing to push for administrative steps that we could take that could reduce incidents of gun violence, and continue pushing Congress to take action on commonsense steps that, again, would reduce gun violence but also protect the Second Amendment rights that so many Americans across the country hold dear and that the President himself personally believes in.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Carrie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, on Bergdahl, you suggested that the White House does trust Congress.\xc2\xa0 But wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the decision in this case a clear example or evidence that you actually don\xe2\x80\x99t -- this White House does not trust Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Congress was consulted on efforts to secure Sergeant Bergdahl\xe2\x80\x99s release, and there are any number of Democratic and Republican members of Congress who have said as much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t loop them in -- my understanding was for this --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure we did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not far enough ahead of time where if it could have gotten out it might have endangered what happened.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is a wise decision when the President himself last week said that he made no apologies for closely holding the details, the precise operational details of a secret military mission.\xc2\xa0 The President makes no apologies for that.\xc2\xa0 That was necessary for the -- to protect, or at least reduce the danger faced by Sergeant Bergdahl and by the American servicemen who were on this mission to secure his release.\xc2\xa0 So I think that was a prudent step that Presidents of both parties have adopted to protect the operational details of secret military missions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that question of how many people knew about the mission itself -- you said a smaller number than 80 or 90 or whatever you said.\xc2\xa0 What is that?\xc2\xa0 A dozen?\xc2\xa0 Two dozen?\xc2\xa0 Less than that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would resist the temptation to hazard a guess.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s a big range between 90 and less than that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication, though --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us anything else to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I recognize it may or may not be double digits, but I do think that it is an indication, though -- (laughter) -- it is an indication, though, of how closely held these precise operational details were.\xc2\xa0 And that is not uncommon.\xc2\xa0 Again, if you have -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to put servicemen and women in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way on a secret military mission, making phone calls and -- making a lot of phone calls around town, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a very prudent measure.\xc2\xa0 And, again, this is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish.\xc2\xa0 This is akin to decisions that have been made by Democratic and Republican Presidents of previous administrations, too.\xc2\xa0 This is not unique just to this Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Josh, if I can follow up right on that, the question is not how many people were briefed on these specifics of where and when you were picking up Bergdahl -- that\xe2\x80\x99s frankly irrelevant.\xc2\xa0 The question is how many people were briefed on the fact that the White House had made a decision to have the deal to exchange Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners.\xc2\xa0 How many of the 90 -- was it all of the 90 -- knew that the White House had decided this was going to go forward?\xc2\xa0 Not when and where they were picking him up in Pakistan or in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I entirely understand your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is very simple:\xc2\xa0 How many in the administration were briefed on the fact that the administration decided to make this exchange -- Taliban detainees at Gitmo for Bergdahl?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to separate two things that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to separate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not really, because the exchange occurred in the context of this secret military mission.\xc2\xa0 By spending a lot of time talking about the fact that a decision like this had been made to send some servicemen and women to go and secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl requires the disclosure of the military mission to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take place, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- I mean, we had all these years -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where Bergdahl was, right?\xc2\xa0 Did we?\xc2\xa0 I mean, telling someone you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a decision to make this deal doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say where the military operation is going to be or even the precise timing of it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely separate question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to separate these two things, because the decision to move forward to secure his release necessarily involves a secret military mission.\xc2\xa0 So again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that you can draw a distinction between those two things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell Congress that you were making a decision to do this trade without telling them exactly where it was going to take place and how it was going to take place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think they would have asked?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think they would have said -- I do not think that would have been the biggest question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what my experience with Congress is.\xc2\xa0 Maybe yours has been a little different than mine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, which member of Congress is asking for operational details?\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any member of Congress ask for operational details.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just make one other thing clear -- and I think that this is also important -- that there had been a number of consultations between senior administration officials and relevant congressional leaders about this proposed swap; that there have been a number of conversations over the years about this possibility.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of the exchange.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Some of them didn\xe2\x80\x99t, some of them did -- right?\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain, when he was being interviewed on a television network, indicated that this was a proposal that he\xe2\x80\x99d strongly consider.\xc2\xa0 So there were differing opinions among members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re certainly entitled to those opinions.\xc2\xa0 Some of them are more informed than others, but they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to those opinions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUltimately, the President and his opinion is the one that carried the day as it should, because of his commitment to this longstanding principle that American servicemembers are not going to get left behind.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, Speaker Boehner today said that the Congress was briefed six months before the bin Laden raid and multiple times before the operation took place, including a heads-up days before it happened.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the detailed conversations that may or may not have taken place between this administration and Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 But let me try to -- I think that is a useful example, so let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat you saw in advance of the bin Laden operation was consultation between this administration and relevant members of Congress about some of the intelligence that had been gathered about bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s possible whereabouts -- that that was something that was the source of a number of conversations between the administration and leaders in Congress.<br/>\n\tHowever, when the decision was made to launch a mission to bring Osama bin Laden to justice, Congress was not notified.\xc2\xa0 Again, these were precise operational details of a secret military mission that had to be kept secret.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Speaker didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a heads-up days before?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Speaker was not informed of precise operational details of a secret military mission.\xc2\xa0 He had been part of conversations.\xc2\xa0 I believe that he was among those members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 There were members of Congress -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not it included Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 If he says it includes him, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of a reason to disagree with him. But there were senior members of Congress who were informed about this intelligence that had been gathered about bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, but they were not notified in advance of the precise operational details of that secret military mission.<br/>\n\tThe reason that this is important is that is a good indication of our procedure when handling these kinds of situations -- right?\xc2\xa0 That you had -- as it relates to Sergeant Bergdahl, Congress was consulted on more than one occasion over the last several years about our efforts to secure his release, and that included the discussion of a possible prisoner exchange.\xc2\xa0 But when the decision was made to execute that exchange in the context of a secret military mission, members of Congress were not notified in advance.\xc2\xa0 And that is consistent with the way that -- well, let me just say it this way:\xc2\xa0 In both cases, you have members of Congress who are kept apprised of our intelligence as it relates to these two national security priorities, but you have some notifications that are not provided because of the need to keep precise operational details of a secret military mission secret.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more quick question.\xc2\xa0 On the exchange, was there anything that the Taliban received besides the five detainees released from Gitmo?\xc2\xa0 Was there anything either from the United States directly or from a third party?\xc2\xa0 Any financial considerations or anything else besides the release of those five detainees?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these reports that suggest that a ransom was somehow paid, and those reports are inaccurate.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Inaccurate -- not from the United States government, not from a third party?\xc2\xa0 None?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I have a transportation question to ask you.\xc2\xa0 But just quickly to follow up on the 80 to 90 -- I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t give us the magic number.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us, like, a cross-section of these are folks inside the NSC, at the Pentagon, on the Hill, in the State Department?\xc2\xa0 Or where do they come from, the 80 to 90?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, are you asking about the 80 to 90, or some number that\xe2\x80\x99s smaller than 80 or 90?<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whatever you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Well, just tell us what you can about 80 to 90, and then anything about the smaller group.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just describe what the 80 to 90 are again.\xc2\xa0 Let me try to do that, and given the constraints that obviously exist here.\xc2\xa0 The 80 to 90 refers to people who are in the loop -- for lack of a better technical description -- on the intelligence that is collected on Taliban activities in Qatar.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they work for the government, or some of them don\xe2\x80\x99t work for the government?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to elaborate on that.\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9cthey,\xe2\x80\x9d what are you talking about?<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They, the people.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The people in the Taliban, or the 80 to 90 people that I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about?<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 80 to 90 --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I want to be precise, though, because the details are important.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 80 to 90.\xc2\xa0 You say they are people.\xc2\xa0 Are they people who work for the Obama administration?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They are.\xc2\xa0 So these are members of the Obama administration.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the 80 to 90 are all members of the --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, yes.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that include contractors or just government workers?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not that includes contractors.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s people who work at the White House and within agencies.\xc2\xa0 And those agencies include the Pentagon and any other agencies?\xc2\xa0 Intel agency -- CIA?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to get into this kind of granular detail.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say that people who are typically in the loop on this kind of intelligence, people who you\xe2\x80\x99d expect to be in the loop on this kind of intelligence were, and the number of those people was 80 to 90.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the other thing I want to reiterate here, though, is that is not necessarily to the exclusion of consultation with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 There were a number of consultations earlier this year, in 2011 and in 2012, on this topic.\xc2\xa0 And that means that, to varying degrees, members of Congress from relevant committees and in the leadership were apprised of these kinds of details.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when we talk about the 80 to 90, those are 80 to 90 people who work for the administration and --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I think that was the specific question that was asked in this classified briefing, which is how many members of the administration were aware.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The transportation question I wanted to ask is --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Fire away.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Secretary Foxx today has said that he opposes this Republican-backed idea, the one where you would take the savings from the ending the Saturday and infusing the Highway Trust Fund on a short-term basis with that.\xc2\xa0 But the administration has already supported ending Saturday mail delivery and also has been looking for extra money for the Highway Trust Fund.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is, is the White House taking sides on this?\xc2\xa0 And if so, which side are you taking on it?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a good question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to take that question and see if we can get you a precise answer on that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJC?<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now almost two weeks since the release of these prisoners from Gitmo.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration have any information on the status of these individuals from the Amir of Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s office or any intelligence as well?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, there were certain agreements that were struck between this government and the government of Qatar about the restrictions that would be placed on these detainees after they were transferred to Qatar.\xc2\xa0 And we have not been in a position to provide a lot of details about what those restrictions are beyond the one-year travel restriction that\xe2\x80\x99s been publicly reported.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President, when he was asked about this last week when he was in Europe, articulated his own confidence in the ability of our intelligence agencies and our military to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President concluded that executing this prisoner exchange was in the best interest of our national security.\xc2\xa0 This was a determination that was shared by the Secretary of Defense and, frankly, every senior member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team.<br/>\n\tSo we have confidence that this exchange has been done in accordance with the agreement thus far.<br/>\n\tStephen.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 You repeatedly said that Maliki needed to address outstanding issues.\xc2\xa0 Is it the position of the White House that to some extent the Iraqi government brought the situation on itself because it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough to reach out to Sunni communities?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is too much to say that the Iraqi government has brought this on itself.\xc2\xa0 We condemn in the strongest possible terms this aggression that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing from this extremist group.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we\xe2\x80\x99re offering so much security and military cooperation with the Maliki government to try to fight against this aggression.\xc2\xa0 A lot of this aggression is targeting innocent Iraqi citizens -- it\xe2\x80\x99s despicable.\xc2\xa0 And we stand with the Iraqi people as they fight it.<br/>\n\tBut that said, there is more that can be done by all of the political leadership in Iraq, including Prime Minister Maliki, to better reflect -- or to better represent the needs of all the Iraqi people, and to address some of the unmet needs and concerns that have been expressed by the citizens there.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it say about the cohesion of the Iraqi forces right now -- which the U.S. and its allies trained -- the second-biggest city in Iraq could fall to these groups?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer an assessment about their military capabilities.\xc2\xa0 We do still feel like we have a partner there that we can work with in terms of a security cooperation, offering military assistance and counterterrorism assistance as well.\xc2\xa0 That relationship continues notwithstanding what clearly is a deterioration in the security condition in at least one province in Iraq.<br/>\n\tPeter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, obviously, the trade was five Taliban members for Bowe Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 Were there ever considerations in those conversations with members of Congress that it might be four, would you be satisfied with four; it would be six?\xc2\xa0 Where is the line drawn in terms of what our willingness is in exchange for an American who is in captivity?\xc2\xa0 As the President said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sacred obligation we have to our troops.\xc2\xa0 Where does he draw that line?\xc2\xa0 When would it have been too many?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that that is a judgment that\xe2\x80\x99s made on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 In this circumstance, this prisoner swap is one that had been long contemplated.\xc2\xa0 So again, the prospect of exchanging these specific five prisoners in Guantanamo for Sergeant Bergdahl is one that had been contemplated for some time and is one that is an arrangement that had previously been discussed with senior members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of continuity involved in this determination that had been reached.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you said four, would the Taliban have said no?\xc2\xa0 Or three, or two, or one?\xc2\xa0 Did we try?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer up or to even have any knowledge of the negotiating position that had been adopted by the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 But Michelle asked me sort of a similar line of questioning yesterday about this, about why there weren\xe2\x80\x99t other aspects of -- why there weren\xe2\x80\x99t other elements introduced into the deal, like future negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simple:\xc2\xa0 Our primary goal in the context of these talks over the last few months has been the release and -- the releasing of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 That was our goal, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we were pursuing quite aggressively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you quickly just more specific to what happened today in Troutdale, Oregon.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on the shooting that took place in Oregon today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And beyond that right now, the President said at the time of the Sandy Hook shooting that he hoped there would never be another incident like this under his watch as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 As of today, there have been 75 shootings at a school in one form or another since Sandy Hook -- 75 shootings in the last 18 months.\xc2\xa0 That averages out to more than four a month in one form or another.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President walking out to this podium, as he did in the days that immediately followed Sandy Hook, on a daily basis or in some form -- it\xe2\x80\x99s campaign season quickly approaching -- and making this a higher priority not just behind the scenes, but actively in front of the American people right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And I think anybody who watched him speak publicly about this issue in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting could see that this is an issue that affected the President personally.\xc2\xa0 And he does have a commitment to trying to make progress on this issue, that there are some commonsense things that can be done that would make our communities safer and not infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans coming in the near future?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that the other thing that the President observed was that progress on this issue is going to require citizens across the country making clear that this is a priority to them, too; that it had to be individual members of Congress who are hearing from their constituents that commonsense steps should be taken by Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is going to continue to look for opportunities to act administratively, unilaterally, using his executive authority to try to make our community safer.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re always looking for those kinds of opportunities.\xc2\xa0 But none of those opportunities, when they present themselves, is going to be an acceptable substitute for robust legislative action.\xc2\xa0 And that legislative action has been attempted, but blocked.\xc2\xa0 And the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to remove that obstacle is for people all across the country who share the President\xe2\x80\x99s concern to make their voice heard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the topic of immigration, according to the Border Patrol, 48,000 unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have now entered the U.S. this year alone through the first -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not even through six months of the year right now.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have concerns that this could, in some form, derail efforts at immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 The principles related to immigration reform are crystal clear.\xc2\xa0 They are strongly backed by Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 They are strongly backed by business leaders and leaders in the faith community all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m looking here in my folder to read to you briefly from a letter that was sent to members of Congress just today by leading business leaders from across the country.\xc2\xa0 It says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe write, as chief executive officers of American companies -- some large, some small -- to express our support for immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We urge Congress to act, the sooner the better, to fix immigration so it works for our businesses and our communities.\xc2\xa0 We need better border security and better immigration law enforcement, including in the workplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They go on to say that, \xe2\x80\x9cwith secure borders in place, we also need a practical solution for the millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does this demonstrate in some form a loophole that presently exists?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 48,000 people in less than six months, young minors arriving in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear where they\xe2\x80\x99re going, except they\xe2\x80\x99re staying here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a loophole.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that -- DACA would not apply, the deferred action would not apply to these unaccompanied minors.\xc2\xa0 They are going through the immigration process to determine how to return them to their home countries or to otherwise handle their immigration status.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question, very quickly.\xc2\xa0 There are now two teenagers living in the White House.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans that you can share with us to help celebrate Sasha\xe2\x80\x99s birthday today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the birthday plans are today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be something fun, though.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s see here -- April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go to the Ag Secretary.\xc2\xa0 The Shirley Sherrod issue firing is back in your lap again.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack is supposed to testify about her firing.\xc2\xa0 Why did the White House want to prevent him from testifying in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to take your question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the circumstances of this particular lawsuit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask you this then.\xc2\xa0 In the years that followed since her firing, are there any regrets?\xc2\xa0 She has been offered -- Shirley Sherrod was offered jobs, consulting jobs with the federal government and she has refused.\xc2\xa0 And she has not come back to work for the federal government.\xc2\xa0 Are there any regrets about what happened in her firing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that in the immediate aftermath of her firing there was regret expressed.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to add to that circumstance from the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, on the VA, officials are saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s a culture.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the President -- he said it\xe2\x80\x99s a culture that needs to be broken there.\xc2\xa0 Is this administration prepared to \xe2\x80\x9cbreak the culture\xe2\x80\x9d in the VA that has been 40 to 50 years in the making, according to some at the VA?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt that there are serious reforms that need to be put in place at the Veterans Administration.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly about keeping our covenant with American men and women who have put on the uniform of the United States military.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to that has not changed.\xc2\xa0 If anything, the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to that has been strengthened by the problems that have been exposed in that system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this administration will continue to work to put in place reforms that will make sure that we live up to that commitment.\xc2\xa0 That has already included some personnel changes.\xc2\xa0 That has already included some management and operational changes in terms of the way the VA policy is implemented and in terms of the standard operating procedure at the Veterans Affairs Department.\xc2\xa0 So we are casting a wide net in search of reforms.\xc2\xa0 And if there are changes in culture that accompany these reforms that will improve the service that\xe2\x80\x99s provided to our veterans, that will be all the better.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly on that, it took 40 to 50 years -- it took about five decades for this culture to come to this point.\xc2\xa0 Do you think in two and a half years that this administration can break -- successfully break that culture to have a new VA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, as you point out, there have been problems at the VA that previous administrations have also grappled with.\xc2\xa0 These are deeply rooted problems that will not be easily solved.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that every single challenge that\xe2\x80\x99s faced by the VA is going to be solved in two and a half years, but I can assure you we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Tommy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions. Congratulations, first of all, on your new job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My first question -- there has been -- since the Bergdahl swap, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Secretary Kerry, and before that I saw Tommy Vietor on TV also giving his assurances almost with a wink, like you know if these five guys step out of line, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get droned.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, is this just like bravado, or is there like a specific contingency in place for if these guys step out of line?\xc2\xa0 Do we have a drone ready for them?\xc2\xa0 Or not specifically a drone, but --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably another precise operational detail I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into.\xc2\xa0 But let me just say the President was asked a question similar to this when he did his news conference in Poland, and I think his answer is a little instructive.\xc2\xa0 And I got somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s answer on this, too.\xc2\xa0 The President said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing it\xe2\x80\x9d -- meaning executing this transfer of prisoners -- \xe2\x80\x9cif I thought it was contrary to American national security.\xc2\xa0 And we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if, in fact, they are engaged in activities that threaten our defenses.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So the President I think is articulating a pretty clear sense of confidence that our national security -- that threats to our national security have been sufficiently mitigated.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the Secretary of Defense himself also certified.</p>\n<p>I also saw that retired General Paul Eaton was asked about this as well, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThese are not super villains.\xc2\xa0 We have exchanged them, which has been going on since the beginning of time, for one of our guys.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re releasing five Joes out there who are not super villains.\xc2\xa0 They can be captured or killed in the future, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why we\xe2\x80\x99re so afraid of these guys.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So there are certainly members of our uniformed military or gentlemen who have served honorably in our United States military who are confident in our military capabilities to protect the nation\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like anybody ever asked about this.\xc2\xa0 And now that these Nevada shooters have been implicated as having been supporters of Cliven Bundy, was the President satisfied with the way that the Bureau of Land Management handled the standoff at the Bundy Ranch, and you had these armed militia guys pointing loaded weapons at law enforcement officials?\xc2\xa0 And that was just sort of -- they sort of just let that go and backed off.\xc2\xa0 Was the President satisfied with the way that whole thing was handled?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to sort of delve into this territory, because I know there is an ongoing investigation in Las Vegas surrounding this tragic shooting that we saw there over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to ask you about Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 Can you name one member of Congress, a Democrat or Republican, who has demanded operational details of the military mission?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to -- I mean, you can ask them if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that they would be interested in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re citing that as a reason to not inform Congress about this swap.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you are.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you were doing with Jon repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 You said that we\xe2\x80\x99re not about to give up operational details.\xc2\xa0 Who is asking for operational details?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I was making clear, Ed, is that we had repeatedly consulted with members of Congress about our ongoing efforts to obtain the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 That consultation is something that this administration remains committed to.\xc2\xa0 And that consultation was shared with a wide variety of members of Congress, including leadership and those in relevant communities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the run-up to the swap it was shared?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking months ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about both this year and in previous years, that this had been the source of a number of discussions between senior administration officials and our --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- one swap directly.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These briefings last night with Tony Blinken and other officials here, House members came out -- some of them on the record, including Republican Buck McKeon, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\xc2\xa0 He says that when pressed about who made the final call on this swap, that Tony Blinken, Deputy National Security Advisor here, said Chuck Hagel, the Defense Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Commander-in-Chief\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to make sure that no American servicemember is left behind.\xc2\xa0 And this is a principle the President is committed to.\xc2\xa0 The President himself talked about why this is an important principle to protect and why he believed that this exchange of prisoners was in the best interest of our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President personally signed off on it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is something that Secretary Hagel and every other member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team agreed with.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no daylight between the President and any of his national security advisors about the wisdom of this decision --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President signed off on this, just to be clear, or did Chuck Hagel?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President sign off on this swap?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is the Commander-in-Chief, and the President is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately responsible for making sure that we fulfill this commitment that we don\xe2\x80\x99t leave anybody behind.\xc2\xa0 Now, there were some attendant decisions to be made about what we could do to mitigate the threat to our national security through the release of these five Gitmo detainees.\xc2\xa0 The President determined that that threat to our national security had been sufficiently mitigated.\xc2\xa0 That was something that the Secretary of Defense also certified, but that was also the widespread unanimous agreement of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones Secretary Clinton with the book coming out.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you, though, not about the book but specific policy issues that she talked about.\xc2\xa0 She was asked last night on ABC about how, when she was Secretary of State, there were no major peace agreements, no major achievements that she could point to, and she responded, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had Presidents\xe2\x80\x9d -- saying over the years -- \xe2\x80\x9cwho have made tough calls, hard choices\xe2\x80\x9d -- \xe2\x80\x9csome of which have worked out, some of which have not.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Since she actually served under this President, can you name two or three accomplishments that she and the President had in the first term on foreign policy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Feels a little like a pop quiz, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of ideas.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with what I think the President would describe as one of his most important national security priorities, which is ending the war in Iraq and winding down in responsible fashion the war in Afghanistan, and doing that after the success of our efforts to dismantle and destroy al Qaeda core that had established a base of operations in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 That is a significant foreign policy accomplishment, and that was an accomplishment that is due in no small part to the bravery of our men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0 But there was also a very important role to be played by other members of our national security team, including intelligence officers, including diplomatic officers, and some civilian employees of the federal government who have played an important role in trying to build up civil institutions in Afghanistan so that Afghanistan could never again be used as a base of operations for al Qaeda core or other extremists that seek to do harm to the United States of America and our allies.</p>\n<p>So in terms of important foreign policy accomplishments for which Secretary Clinton can rightly claim her share of the credit, I would put ending the war in Iraq, responsibly winding down the war in Afghanistan, and decimating and destroying core al Qaeda -- that those are a handful of accomplishments that certainly this President and this Commander-in-Chief are proud of, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that -- those are the kinds of accomplishments that Secretary Clinton can justifiably be proud of as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 This morning on \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning, America\xe2\x80\x9d she did another interview and she said that she had a meeting with then-Senator Obama in 2008 when she wound down her campaign.\xc2\xa0 She called it an awkward but necessary meeting because she wanted to clear the air on a couple of issues.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cOne of them was the sexism that unfortunately was present in that 2008 campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel bad about that -- that there were moments where she felt like the Obama campaign, other Democratic campaigns -- she cited John Edwards commenting on her clothing -- does the President feel bad that Secretary Clinton felt that there was sexism in that campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that is leaving the suggestion that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave in her -- it is hard for me to comment on this because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the interview.\xc2\xa0 Suffice it to say that there was certainly -- it was a historic campaign and one the President was proud to be involved in.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that that campaign was so historic -- well, there are many reasons, but one of those reasons is that you had a woman like Secretary Clinton -- then-Senator Clinton, who was running such a powerful, strong, sophisticated, popular campaign for the presidency.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen before.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that Secretary Clinton is proud of and should be proud of.\xc2\xa0 The President ran his own historic campaign that he, too, is proud of.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is a testament to both leaders that after a vibrant, contentious, hotly debated campaign, that the two of them worked together in the first term of this administration to accomplish some really important things.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, one thing on Iraq and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to Bergdahl things.\xc2\xa0 In the statement released by the State Department, it said the United States supports a strong, coordinated response to push back against this aggression in Mosul.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 And does that suggest a more forceful and engaged U.S. military role with Iraq that we have seen since the pullout?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what it reflects is a commitment that we have under the Status of Forces Agreement Strategic Framework Agreement, to assist the Maliki government in fighting these forces of extremism, including those who are perpetrating terrible acts of violence on Iraqi civilians.\xc2\xa0 Let me address it this way:\xc2\xa0 We remain engaged in an ongoing discussion with the Iraqi government on how we can continue to support Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism effort as part of our overall strategic partnership.\xc2\xa0 Iraq will not succeed unless its security forces are well supplied, trained, and equipped.\xc2\xa0 That goes to the list of supplies that I read earlier.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me finish with this:\xc2\xa0 Our response to Iraqi requests for expedited deliveries of defense articles since the Anbar crisis began in January has been rapid, comprehensive, and is continuing.\xc2\xa0 Our assistance enables Iraq to combat ISIL on the front lines, where hundreds of Iraqi security force personnel have been killed or injured in that fight this year.</p>\n<p>So there is an enduring relationship that we have that involves the United States of America providing military assistance and counterterrorism cooperation with the Iraqi government to try to protect Iraqi civilians from these acts of terrorism.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The key question is, does this particular event suggest to the President that he needs to bring his team together and look at other ideas or to dramatically or just incrementally ramp up what we have done to, as this statement says, push back against this aggression, possibly reverse it, and stabilize the situation that is currently unstable and getting worse?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is fair for you to conclude that we are closely watching this situation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about how the security situation in Mosul has deteriorated so precipitously in just the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re watching, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that with an eye to examining how we can better support the Maliki government and the Iraqi people as they fight these extremist forces in their country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple things on this 80 to 90 -- because I think for the public record, you and I -- for the betterment of everyone here, can sort of walk through this in ways that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m game to give it a try.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- will not compromise your limitations.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the record, this administration said Justice, the Pentagon, State Department, and the White House, NSC were all involved in the final decision and consulted and agreed -- correct?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you said on the record.\xc2\xa0 All those various agencies were involved at one level or another on the ultimate decision -- not the operational details, but the process of going through and making this swap, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that list of agencies in front of me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to grant the premise of where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that would at least -- I mean, just sort of sorting that out mentally, you could probably come up with five to 10 in each of those agencies, so at least we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 20, 25 people who had at least general knowledge and perhaps signoff authority on this swap.\xc2\xa0 Fair enough?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to also remember --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not operational details, but the swap itself, that it was going to happen.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that they were aware that this is something that had been discussed.\xc2\xa0 Again, the going-to-happen thing -- as soon as you start talking about this swap happening, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a secret military mission.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of Jon\xe2\x80\x99s line of questioning that was very difficult to answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But remember, when this story first broke, among the things that was said by this White House was, well, we talked to Justice about it -- meaning \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d at the Pentagon and State Department -- coordinated with them; they found it to be something worthy of signing off on.\xc2\xa0 So it sounded as if there was a multi-agency involvement in the actual \xe2\x80\x9cyes, this is something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do, the security situation has been addressed or thought through, and a decision has been made; State Department thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s okay diplomatically, the Justice Department thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s okay legally.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All those things are on the record.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a mystery.\xc2\xa0 So it just sounds to me like we\xe2\x80\x99re in the range of 20, 25 people who would have been in a position to be -- knowledge of this happening and sign off on it.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair assessment?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair assessment because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly how many people were in the loop in these kinds of conversations.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to understand and reflect that a number of conversations were had with members of Congress about this precise swap.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Theoretical conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Theoretical conversations?\xc2\xa0 They had specific conversations about our efforts to secure Sergeant Bergdahl\xe2\x80\x99s release, and specific conversations that that release could require the swap of these five Guantanamo detainees.</p>\n<p>So, I mean, if you want to call it a theoretical discussion, you can.\xc2\xa0 But I would call it a pretty specific --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not calling it, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re calling it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But I would actually describe it as a pretty specific and candid outline of a possible deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that in itself constitutes the required and necessary consultation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what Congress was seeking and is seeking, and I think rightfully seeks, is consultation with this administration on important national security priorities.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that there have been a number of discussions from senior administration officials with members of Congress about efforts to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl, and that release requiring the exchange of five specific prisoners from Guantanamo, is an indication of our commitment to that consultation.</p>\n<p>Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s also a separate issue, which is that there are specific members of Congress who have expressed their displeasure with being left out of the loop about this specific secret military mission.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is there\xe2\x80\x99s actually probably not any disagreement here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m acknowledging candidly that we did not notify them of the precise operational details of this mission, and there are no regrets about that.\xc2\xa0 And that was necessary to protect the operational security of the mission.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congratulations again.\xc2\xa0 Senator Jim Inhofe, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, considers himself one of those who was not brought in on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And he says, yesterday, that the issue is not Bergdahl at all, it is the idea of simply releasing Taliban terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And he pointed out that when they were released, Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Supreme Commander of Taliban, said this was a great victory for Taliban.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to Senator Inhofe when he says the issue of the five who are being released and releasing five people who are combatants and terrorists, in his view?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is, as I mentioned just to Major, that there were specific consultations by administration officials with relevant members of Congress -- I do not know whether or not that includes Senator Inhofe -- but with relevant members of Congress about our efforts to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 And those consultations included the idea that Sergeant Bergdahl\xe2\x80\x99s release would be predicated on a prisoner swap and the release of five Taliban detainees who had previously been detained in Guantanamo.</p>\n<p>The second important thing for Senator Inhofe and your readers to understand is that these Gitmo detainees were transferred to the custody of Qatar, and that there have been limitations placed on their activities.</p>\n<p>Third, I would point out that the President, the Secretary of Defense, and uniformed military personnel like retired General Paul Eaton and retired General James Mattis, who have indicated that the risk posed to our national security by their release has been sufficiently mitigated -- that we have capabilities to protect our national security that will be used to protect our national security from threats posed by these released detainees.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The senator did say the recidivism rate is 30 percent with released prisoners so far.\xc2\xa0 In other words, 30 percent of those released have gone back into combat.\xc2\xa0 Was that a figure that was discussed by any of these people who certified?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read you in on on discussions that may have included that.\xc2\xa0 But the President himself was asked about this, again, at the news conference that he did in Poland, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to his remarks there.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll just summarize here.\xc2\xa0 In terms of potential threats, the release of the Taliban who are being held in Guantanamo was conditioned on the Qataris keeping eyes on them and creating a structure in which we can monitor their activities.\xc2\xa0 We will be keeping eyes on them.\xc2\xa0 Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo.</p>\n<p>And again, I would refer you to the remarks of General Eaton and General Mattis, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are quite capable, the ferocity and the skill of our troops when we close in on an enemy, these guys will not be that difficult to take out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Jared, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would the White House do to improve security and trust with Congress so that the President can comply with the reporting requirements of the NDAA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 We have articulated our concerns in the past about whether or not the requirements of the NDAA are, in fact, constitutional.\xc2\xa0 The President and his attorneys have made what I think is a pretty persuasive case that they\xe2\x80\x99re not, but that is the subject of some debate between this administration and Congress.</p>\n<p>That is why, as a matter of course, when we have released Gitmo detainees in the past or transferred Gitmo detainees in the past, that 30-day notice has been provided.\xc2\xa0 In this case, there was -- an exception was made because of the urgent particulars of this specific situation, which is the need to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s action in Mosul an indication that the civil war in Syria is moving to other countries?\xc2\xa0 What can the U.S. do about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, the President has talked for quite some time now about -- well, the President and others have talked for quite some time now about the destabilizing impact that the violence and combat that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Syria right now is destabilizing other countries.\xc2\xa0 And the prospect that neighbors of Syria are threatened by that violence is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re significantly concerned about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has worked in cooperative fashion to try to mobilize regional partners to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 The President has met a number of times with the King of Jordan to talk about this issue.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this is one of the many reasons that we are monitoring closely the activities that are ongoing in Syria because of the threat that they pose to other countries in the region; that we can see elements of that fight spill into other countries and destabilize the security situation in those other countries.</p>\n<p>That is what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 The potential exists for that to occur in other countries.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we are concerned about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the fighting along the border between Syria and Anbar province, is the White House doing anything at all to mitigate the refugee problem that\xe2\x80\x99s happening across that international border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are doing two things.\xc2\xa0 One is we are cooperating closely with the Iraqi government to make sure that they have the resources that they need to launch counterterrorism missions and otherwise provide for the security of their country.</p>\n<p>But secondly, the United States continues to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees.\xc2\xa0 We do that by offering up financial assistance to countries that are housing refugees.\xc2\xa0 We also do that by working through the U.N. and other nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations to try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of those that have been displaced by the fighting in Syria.</p>\n<p>This has been a humanitarian disaster on an unthinkable scale.\xc2\xa0 And the humanitarian toll that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken on people in Syria and in neighboring countries is significant.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States is such a big donor to efforts to try to meet those needs, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also why it\xe2\x80\x99s the subject of so much concern by this administration.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
