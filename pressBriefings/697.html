Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>2:15 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, so I will go straight to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be a little bit of confusion about what exactly the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office was told the week of April 22nd about the IG report.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what Kathy Ruemmler was told?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There have been a lot of questions this morning that we\'ve gotten based on recent reports about when we here at the White House learned of the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s report, what we learned and how we learned, so I\'d like to back up and just go through the fundamentals here first, if I may.</p>\n<p>Number one, as the independent Inspector General testified and as his report says, he found no evidence that anyone outside of the IRS had any involvement in the inappropriate scrutinizing of conservative groups who were applying for tax exempt status.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Number two, no one in this building intervened in an ongoing, independent investigation or did anything that could be seen as intervening in that investigation.</p>\n<p>Number three, the misconduct had stopped in May of 2012.\xc2\xa0 So despite all the media interest in our April 2013 awareness, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that the misconduct, of course, had stopped almost a year earlier.</p>\n<p>But going to your question, and in light of those questions, let me walk you through this because we don\'t have any interest in being anything other than clear with you about that timeline.</p>\n<p>So, as we have said, the White House Counsel, Kathy Ruemmler, learned during the week of April 22nd -- the specific date is April 24th -- that the Inspector General was finalizing an audit.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they call this kind of report.\xc2\xa0 At the time, the audit was still ongoing and the Inspector General had not issued its final report.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office routinely receives notification of pending Inspector General matters, as does Congress, and in fact, this was one of several IG reports likely to be released soon that were communicated to staff in the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office on April 16th in a series of items.</p>\n<p>But on April 24th, as I said, the White House Counsel, Kathy Ruemmler, was informed that the Inspector General for Tax Administration was completing a report about line IRS employees improperly scrutinizing what are known as 501(c)(4) organizations by using words such as \xe2\x80\x9ctea party\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Counsel was further informed that the report had not been finalized and the publication date of the report was uncertain but likely soon.</p>\n<p>While we had an indication of the likely findings, until the IG finalizes his report, the findings and conclusions are subject to change.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, many IG reports do change significantly before they are published.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So to be clear, we knew the subject of the investigation and we knew the nature of some of the potential findings, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a copy of the draft report; we did not know the details, the scope or the motivation surrounding the misconduct; and we did not know who was responsible.\xc2\xa0 Most importantly, the report was not final and still very much subject to change.</p>\n<p>After that initial notification in April, the White House Counsel informed the Chief of Staff and other members of the senior staff.\xc2\xa0 At no time did anyone on the White House staff intervene with the IRS Inspector General audit.\xc2\xa0 There were communications between White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office and White House Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s Office, with Treasury Office of General Counsel and Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Chief of Staff Office to understand the anticipated timing of the release of the report and the potential findings by the IG.</p>\n<p>We know that the Hill also got briefings.\xc2\xa0 As Congressman Issa said, he was aware of \xe2\x80\x9capproximately\xe2\x80\x9d what was in the report.\xc2\xa0 But he, rightly, chose to not take action, because the cardinal rule is to not intervene in an independent investigation or take any steps that could be seen as intervening.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we abided by, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what any White House should do.</p>\n<p>I just want to say that some reporting today suggests -- and this is I think worth noting -- suggests that given awareness of the potential findings, we should have done more.\xc2\xa0 That could not be further from the right course of action.\xc2\xa0 The cardinal rule, as I said, is that you do not intervene in an independent investigation, and you do not do anything that would be -- that would give such an appearance, particularly when the final conclusions -- as was the case here -- have not been reached.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the doctrine we followed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the bottom line is -- and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the most important fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s what we have said from the beginning -- not the White House, nor Treasury intervened in the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s audit.\xc2\xa0 So I hope that -- anticipating this question, understanding there was some confusion about it, I hope that supplies the answers that you were hoping to get.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It supplies some of them.\xc2\xa0 Can I just clarify a couple things?\xc2\xa0 You said someone was told on April 16th in the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler was notified on April -- the week of April 22nd.\xc2\xa0 There was also a notification as part of just a series of items, IG-related items, from Treasury that this was upcoming -- again, very top line.\xc2\xa0 But White House Counsel herself was not notified until later -- the next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who was she notified by?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Either within Treasury or by someone else in the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office.\xc2\xa0 But the same notification process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who else besides Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was told about this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Some other members of the senior staff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us who?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list for you, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then last week, when this all first came out, you said that the Counsel was told very broadly, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention anything else about other staff knowing.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention some of these more specific details that they were told, including some of the words that this IRS office used to target some of these groups.\xc2\xa0 Is that, what you\xe2\x80\x99re telling us today, consistent with your statement last week that the Counsel was only told very broadly about this report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think she was, as I just described and that the entirety of what she was told, broadly, that there is an Inspector General audit reaching its conclusion; the potential findings are that some people improperly targeted conservative organizations in their applications for tax exempt status.\xc2\xa0 But there was no specificity about who, about motivation, certainly no names of involvement.\xc2\xa0 And it was not concluded.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to know the way these things work, IG reports, that the finalization process can result in significant changes.</p>\n<p>So our whole point has been that knowing that this was coming does not change the fact that there was nothing we could have or should have done about it, because it was an independent Inspector General report.\xc2\xa0 And, again, as I said at the end, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat ironic that there has been some suggestion that action should have been taken because we were aware that the IG was -- an independent IG was reaching the conclusion of a report and that it might have these findings, that somehow the President should have been notified or that we should have done something.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, of course, the opposite is true, because these kinds of independent investigations need to be independent.\xc2\xa0 There should be no intervention by a White House.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, there was not in this case.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we had to wait, appropriately, until the report was publicized, or published, for the President to be able to review it and respond, as he did very quickly.\xc2\xa0 He took action right away.\xc2\xa0 He made sure that Secretary Lew asked for and accepted the resignation of the acting commissioner.\xc2\xa0 He appointed a new acting commissioner.\xc2\xa0 He very quickly made sure that the new acting commissioner would institute a top-down 30-day review of everything we could find out about this, or they could find out about this, to make sure that those who participated in the failings are held responsible, and that the activity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is if the White House felt comfortable with the Counsel, the Chief of Staff, and other members of his senior staff knowing about this report, even very broadly, and was not concerned that just the mere fact of knowing it created the potential for interference, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President have also just known that this was coming without interfering?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a judgment, in this case, the judgment of the White House Counsel, that this is not a matter that you should -- or that she should convey to the President.\xc2\xa0 And that was her opinion that she expressed to other members of the senior staff -- that this is not the kind of thing, when you have an ongoing investigation or an ongoing audit, that requires notification to the President -- because what is important is that we wait until that kind of process is completed before we take action.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House know in advance that the IRS was going to plant a question at the American Bar Association event on May 10th?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a way of getting news out?\xc2\xa0 No?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was the White House involved at all in the strategy for sort of rolling out the disclosure of the report\xe2\x80\x99s findings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that it was coming, and when it was reported on that Friday, that\'s how the President found out about it and some of us found out about it.\xc2\xa0 So, no, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And further to what Julie had asked, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given us some details --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear because I said this in the earlier part -- there were conversations -- after White House Counsel was notified and told some senior staff members, there were conversations between staff here and Treasury about what was the timing going to be, what would the findings likely be, in anticipation of that.\xc2\xa0 But there was no foreknowledge of when this happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And today you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve given us some more details about who knew what when -- the April 16th detail, the discussions between the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office and Treasury, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us that week on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday when you talked about this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just told you what I told you last week, which is that Kathy Ruemmler, the White House Counsel, was made aware the week of April 22nd.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve now gotten the specific date of April 24th.\xc2\xa0 It does turn out when we looked at this that there was, as part of this notification process, a series of IG\xc2\xa0 -- pending IG matters that was conveyed to, communicated to someone on the staff of the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office, but that information did not reach Kathy Ruemmler until the following week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just say when the other White House staffers were notified?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 After Kathy Ruemmler was notified on the 24th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She briefed them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 She informed them, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because when you were asked about this in a briefing last week about White House officials being aware, you just mentioned the Counsel\'s Office.\xc2\xa0 You never mentioned that the Chief of Staff and others were notified.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said that White House Counsel knew.\xc2\xa0 I think I said that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know until Friday.\xc2\xa0 But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\'m getting this information to you now.\xc2\xa0 The point is Counsel knew on April 24th -- White House Counsel did.\xc2\xa0 And she informed some other senior staff.\xc2\xa0 And in informing she also made clear that it was her view, and others shared this view, that there was not a need, in a situation like this with an ongoing investigation or audit, that the President should be notified.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did Denis McDonough and the other members of the senior staff do with that information?\xc2\xa0 Did they share it with others?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There were discussions here and, as I said, there were conversations from the White House Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s Office with general counsel at Treasury and the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s Office at Treasury about the timing -- anticipated timing of the release of the report and the potential findings, but there was\xc2\xa0 -- again, the point was no intervention, no action, because it would be entirely inappropriate to do anything except ultimately wait for what the findings would be and then act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of notifying anyone if nothing can be done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The way, as I understand it and it\xe2\x80\x99s been described to me, is that when there are IG reports -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to know because this is Washington-speak when we\'re talking about IG audits and things like that, but there are inspectors general all across the government and they are routinely looking into matters that are assigned to them or that they take up, and there are reports routinely completed or near completion.\xc2\xa0 And when there is one that might get -- that an IG feels, or the overseeing body -- in this case Treasury -- feels might get a lot of attention, there are notifications made just to -- \xe2\x80\x9con your radar\xe2\x80\x9d kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no action that\'s taken -- at least there should be no action taken.\xc2\xa0 And that was the case here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why did she feel incumbent to tell Denis McDonough but not the President?\xc2\xa0 Is it standard practice to insulate the President from controversial IG reports across the board?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it was, again, a notification, just so you know, this is coming down, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we know about it, we\'ll find out more when it\xe2\x80\x99s completed, IG reports -- I\'m just paraphrasing as sort of an example -- IG reports tend to change a lot before finalized, we don\'t know the specifics of who did this, why they did it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- know a draft audit was shared with Treasury in mid-March.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, but not shared with us.\xc2\xa0 Treasury oversees the IRS.\xc2\xa0 That\'s my understanding, but I would refer you to Treasury.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we did not -- as I described it to you, that was what we learned about -- or the Counsel learned about the potential or likely findings, that there were line employees at the IRS who improperly targeted conservative groups with the language that I just used, and that this report was likely to be completed soon, although we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer why the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t told but McDonough was.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as I noted earlier, in these situations, the Counsel made the decision that this is not the kind of thing that you notify the President of, of an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s not complete, because it wouldn\'t be appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just figure out -- confusion about how involved Sarah Hall Ingram has been at the IRS division in question.\xc2\xa0 If you go to their website, she\xe2\x80\x99s still to this day listed as commissioner of the Office of Tax Exempt/Government Entities Division.\xc2\xa0 But the IRS says she\xe2\x80\x99s also been assigned to help head up the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So throughout the time in question, was she in charge of the office that did targeting --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you would have to ask -- my understanding based on what I\'ve seen is that she was reassigned to another responsibility.\xc2\xa0 I understand the title may have -- she may have kept the title, but that\'s the kind of detail that you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask IRS and Treasury.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President like to see somebody else --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that, as I understand it, based on the IG\xe2\x80\x99s report, which is how I got my information on this, that she is not named in the report, and as far as we know, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no suggestion that she did anything improper.\xc2\xa0 But the President has asked the new acting IRS commissioner to conduct a top-down 30-day review to look at these questions about accountability and look at how -- to take measures to ensure that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he like her to recuse herself from the role for 30 days?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a question I think appropriately addressed to the new leadership at IRS and at Treasury.\xc2\xa0 IRS is conducting a 30-day review.\xc2\xa0 Before you decide that somebody is culpable of something I think you need to get the facts first.\xc2\xa0 And based on my understanding of the IG report, this is not addressed.\xc2\xa0 So there is a 30-day top-down review being conducted by the new acting IRS commissioner, and I expect that some of these issues will be looked at.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, but for all the questions about who knew what a few weeks ago at the White House, isn\'t the question back further?\xc2\xa0 How was this allowed to go on for 18 months?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there were public reports while this was still happening of groups complaining that they had been asked these outrageous questions --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a great question.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why there was an IG audit, I believe in response in part to congressional inquiries, and the finding -- but I take your question.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you saw the President\xe2\x80\x99s response, which was very clear.\xc2\xa0 He was outraged by the behavior; he thought the conduct was inappropriate, that people need to be held responsible -- and that process has begun -- and we need to make sure that nothing like this can happen again.\xc2\xa0 Nobody has been more outraged by the reported conduct here than the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, with all due respect, the outrage from the President came last week.\xc2\xa0 This was going on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The outrage of the President came within hours after the release of the report.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is there were public reports that this stuff was going on almost a year before the presidential election.\xc2\xa0 How is it that nobody in the administration had some responsibility even before there is an Inspector General report\xc2\xa0 -- say, hey, by the way, this kind of activity shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be going on, so let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure and take steps --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would direct you to the IG who investigated this matter, to the Treasury Department and others who addressed this matter.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that what we\'re talking about here was the ongoing Inspector General audit, the fact that we were notified -- the White House Counsel was notified that it was coming to a conclusion.\xc2\xa0 And like Chairman Issa and others, we did not prejudge it; we waited until the report came out before we acted.\xc2\xa0 And the President acted very quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re missing the point of my question.\xc2\xa0 Public reports almost a year before the election.\xc2\xa0 Is there any responsibility from the administration of saying, hey, IRS, we don\'t treat groups differently based on politics?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that it is absolutely --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or we wait for the report after the election to make a comment.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying accusations, and I think -- my understanding is in response to those accusations, there was an IG audit launched.\xc2\xa0 That is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And the findings are what we now know.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s response to those findings could not be more clear.\xc2\xa0 People need to be held responsible, and we need to make sure that this activity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the American people believe that the IRS applies our tax laws fairly and neutrally.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m also just a little confused on this planted question.\xc2\xa0 First of all, does the White House approve of that tactic, of releasing information through a planted question?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know anything more about it than what I read in the paper.\xc2\xa0 Our feeling has been from the beginning, since we were notified of the impending completion of the IG report, that we would refrain from commenting on reports about draft language, reports about what may or may not be in the findings of the IG until the IG actually published his report.\xc2\xa0 When that happened, the President responded very quickly, both within hours after the publication of the report, and then again the next day when he met with Treasury leadership and the acting IRS commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s resignation was accepted and the President appointed a new IRS commissioner.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more question.\xc2\xa0 Does the President approve of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the Jin-Woo Kim leak investigation?\xc2\xa0 We now know that the FBI investigators in this case not only seized James Rosen\xe2\x80\x99s phone records; they went through and read his emails, they tracked his comings and goings inside the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Does the President approve of that kind of action by the Justice Department against a reporter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will refer you to what the President said in response to a question about another matter along these lines, and that is that he is a strong defender of the First Amendment and a firm believer in the need for the press to be able to conduct investigative reporting and facilitate a free flow of information.\xc2\xa0 He is also, as a citizen and as Commander-in-Chief, insistent that we protect our secrets, that we protect classified information, and that leaks -- that we take very seriously the leaks of classified information because leaks can endanger the lives of men and women in uniform and other Americans serving overseas for our country.</p>\n<p>And that is the balance he seeks and it is reflected in the media shield law that his administration negotiated with the Senate in 2009 and which the President is very happy to see the Senate take up again.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a balance that was endorsed at the time by -- from media organizations to federal prosecutors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I cannot, of course, comment on a specific ongoing criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you approve of those kind of tactics as a former reporter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I cannot comment on a specific ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 I certainly share -- and I think most Americans do -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that we need to have a press that is able to pursue investigative journalism and that we have to defend the First Amendment.\xc2\xa0 And I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important, as I think members of both parties have said, that we need to make sure that leaks are not tolerated, because leaks that can endanger the lives of our men and women, and that endanger our national security need to be taken very seriously.</p>\n<p>But that is, again, not a comment on a specific case because I cannot comment on a specific case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up then -- the subpoena says James Rosen is a potential criminal because he\xe2\x80\x99s a reporter.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House comfortable with that standard never before seen in a leak investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Major, I understand the question and I appreciate it, but I cannot comment on an ongoing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not ongoing.\xc2\xa0 That happened.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s in the subpoena.\xc2\xa0 You can read it on the web right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know, but it\xe2\x80\x99s part of an ongoing criminal investigation, Major, and I simply can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to regard a reporter in a subpoena as a potential criminal for doing what reporters do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, I understand the question.\xc2\xa0 I think that the appropriate place to address these questions is to the Department of Justice and to those actually engaged in this criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at the story, there are people who are talking about it, and I would refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 I simply cannot, again, go into --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has prioritized leak investigations in ways no other Commander-in-Chief has.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s his priority that the Justice Department is carrying out.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President, like his predecessors, believes that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if he\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable with this particular application of his priority.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes, I think as all of his predecessors believed, that it is imperative that leaks that can jeopardize the lives of American men and women serving overseas should not be tolerated, and that leaks that can jeopardize our national security are very serious matters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would point you to what the FBI Director, Director Mueller, and the Attorney General have said about the seriousness of one of these leaks.\xc2\xa0 Director Mueller testified that, \xe2\x80\x9cLeaks such as this that threaten ongoing operations put at risk the lives of sources, make it much more difficult to recruit sources, and damage our relationships with our foreign partners.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is why we have to take these seriously.\xc2\xa0 It is also why we need to find the right balance to ensure that our First Amendment is defended and to assure that reporters are protected. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President helped negotiate the media shield law that made its way out of committee in 2009, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he supports its reintroduction today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In your summary at the top, talking about the IRS, you mentioned that the IG audit -- which is the proper word for it -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not an investigation, it\xe2\x80\x99s an audit -- concluded that there was no outside interference or suggestion.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that closes the question?\xc2\xa0 Because several of the committees on Capitol Hill don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it closes the question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We support congressional oversight, legitimate congressional oversight in this matter.\xc2\xa0 We support -- in fact, the President asked for the 30-day top-down review that will be conducted by the new acting IRS commissioner.\xc2\xa0 And I believe I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reported that the Department of Justice is looking into this matter.\xc2\xa0 All of this is appropriate as far as we are concerned.\xc2\xa0 I am simply telling you that the matter that sparked --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t close it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there can and will be and should be oversight and more questions asked.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one of the things that I made clear in answer to Jessica\xe2\x80\x99s question is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the details about who was responsible for this inappropriate behavior.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President wants those who are responsible to be held accountable, and he wants steps taken to ensure that it cannot happen again -- because he has zero tolerance for this.\xc2\xa0 He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the IRS carry out and implement our tax laws in a neutral and fair way, and that Americans needs to be confident that that is happening.\xc2\xa0 And any indication that it\xe2\x80\x99s not needs to be taken very seriously, which is how he has taken it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You obviously asked more questions in preparation for this briefing than were asked and answerable last week.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m curious -- do you know if Treasury Secretary Geithner was informed of the IG report, even in its preliminary state, and if he in any way communicated that to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Secretary Lew and others have addressed this, but I have no knowledge of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on IRS?\xc2\xa0 I just want to know -- just yesterday, Dan Pfeiffer, on the shows, was saying that the Treasury Department informed the White House but did not get into any, in his word, \xe2\x80\x9cdetails\xe2\x80\x9d of what happened on the IRS situation.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday -- last week, rather, at this podium, you said that, in the week of April 22nd, you were only informed that the IG was finishing a review about matters involving the office in Cincinnati.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things I said.\xc2\xa0 I made clear that it was topline conclusions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no details.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And there were no details.\xc2\xa0 I think I just explained to you the details -- the phrases and the fact that they would likely find, likely conclude that this conduct had occurred inappropriately.\xc2\xa0 But we still do not know who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds like some detail.\xc2\xa0 Not like every single detail, but it\xe2\x80\x99s beyond --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re parsing my words.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here to tell you that the information that I just provided to you at the top is the information that White House Counsel received; it\xe2\x80\x99s the information that she conveyed to the some senior staff.\xc2\xa0 And the most important point here is that, contrary to some suggestions about how we should have responded to that, there was no effort to intervene in an ongoing Inspector General inquiry/audit report/investigation, nor should there be.</p>\n<p>And that is why, to the chagrin of some who would have liked us to get out in front of this more, we appropriately waited until the Inspector General published that report and we had all of the information that was available at least in that report to act on and respond to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also said at the top of this briefing the President acted right away, took decisive action, you say.\xc2\xa0 So why then is -- the key person who has been pushed out is Steven Miller, who was planning to retire in June anyway, but also --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know that\xe2\x80\x99s actually mischaracterization.\xc2\xa0 His title was expiring.\xc2\xa0 He could easily have been reappointed had this not happened and I suppose he might have been.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s on the job today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s leaving Wednesday, as I understand it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you -- he may be, Ed.\xc2\xa0 I can refer you to the IRS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in terms of accountability, how is the person still on the job?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe he might he be testifying on the Hill, Ed, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure some people would like to see.\xc2\xa0 So the fact is he was resigned from that post --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He can also testify as a private citizen, of course.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I take your point.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is he\xe2\x80\x99s resigned entirely from the IRS, and a new acting commissioner has been appointed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can you say, on the James Rosen situation, that part of the goal here is to protect reporters when the administration went through his personal email?\xc2\xa0 How are you protecting reporters?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I did say was not respond specifically to a question about the case.\xc2\xa0 I said that the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we find the proper balance between the need, absolute need to protect our secrets and to prevent leaks that can jeopardize the lives of Americans and can jeopardize our national security interests, on the one hand, and the need to defend the First Amendment and protect the ability of reporters to pursue investigative journalism.</p>\n<p>That balance is reflected in the media shield law that the administration negotiated with the Senate in 2009 and that the President supported and which he supports to this day, and is being reintroduced.\xc2\xa0 That bill that the administration negotiated was endorsed by media organizations and federal prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that is an indication of the fact that it at least came some way to achieving the balance that the President has talked about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While we wait for the legislation to potentially pass, in the meantime, the administration is acting in the AP case and in the Rosen case as well.\xc2\xa0 Do you actually believe, as a former reporter, that someone trying to get sensitive information from government officials as a reporter is a criminal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I would just tell you that I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on a specific case.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here as --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in principle?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m here as a spokesman for the President and the White House.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on an ongoing criminal investigation, nor should I.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s tons of precedent for why that is the case.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think that I share the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- personally, as a former reporter, but also in this capacity -- I share the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that we need to find a balance.\xc2\xa0 And I think that most Americans believe that we need to protect our secrets and make sure that classified information that, if leaked, could endanger the lives of Americans or sources is not leaked, and that we take that seriously.\xc2\xa0 But we also have to allow for reporters to freely investigate as part of their jobs. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was referring to when I was talking to his support for the media shield law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow that quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, let me --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I want to -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand.\xc2\xa0 So does the President believe in the media shield law -- the one that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like and then you guys renegotiated -- does he believe in the media shield law that a reporter\xe2\x80\x99s private email and private phone calls should be subject to some sort of subpoena?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I recognize that, as a former practitioner, as a clever way to get me to comment on a specific case, but I can\'t.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President believes that the media shield law that his administration helped negotiate with the Senate achieves, at least in part, the balance that he says he supports and that he wants to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as a firm defender of the First Amendment and the freedom of the press, he seeks that balance even as Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that we are able to take seriously very serious leaks that can jeopardize our national security, jeopardize our men and women.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that we describe it as a balance reflects that this is a difficult issue. But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the point of going after leakers an attempt to keep people from leaking?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 I think in general the issue is to make sure that leaks that are very serious are taken seriously.\xc2\xa0 In terms of how that action -- how that is acted upon by the Department Justice, I would refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but, I mean, is the intended consequence to prevent people from giving out any information?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me about the purposes of a criminal investigation, and I think that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a criminal investigation writ large, obviously there is at least a suspicion of criminal activity.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Justice about the purpose of a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But your intent is to make sure people are --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the intent of criminal investigations is to uncover whether crimes have been committed and to hold people who have committed crimes accountable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 On the IRS, is the President at least upset that basically his entire senior staff knew of this and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, his entire senior staff did not know.\xc2\xa0 There were some senior staff who were alerted by White House Counsel.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, the President -- well, believes and I think he has faith that it is entirely appropriate that nobody here took any action in any way to intervene in an ongoing audit investigation by the Inspector General.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is saying any action, but just not giving him a heads-up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say nobody is saying that -- or at least suggesting it.\xc2\xa0 But, no, he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate that some matters are not appropriate to convey to him, and this is one of them.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve asked him this specific question -- is he satisfied that he had to learn through the media and not through his senior staff?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously aware of the course of these reports.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that it is entirely appropriate that the President not be notified of something of an ongoing, not concluded Inspector General audit of IRS activity -- because I guess the suggestion of alerting him is that then he would do something.\xc2\xa0 And if he were to do something, imagine what that story would look like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we can look to the history books to get a feel for.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely the cardinal rule, as we see it, that we do not intervene in ongoing investigations.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true of one of the matters that\xe2\x80\x99s come up with regards to reporters, and it\xe2\x80\x99s true -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing criminal investigation or criminal investigations conducted by the Department of Justice -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s true of an Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s audit of the IRS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the job Eric Shinseki has done as Secretary of Veterans Affairs?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is.\xc2\xa0 He has also made clear to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is satisfied with the job he\xe2\x80\x99s done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he is.\xc2\xa0 He is satisfied.\xc2\xa0 He has confidence in General Shinseki.\xc2\xa0 But he has made it clear to, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, to the General and to others that he expects results as they try to tackle this very difficult issue of the backlog at the VA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is something that has the attention of the President.\xc2\xa0 It has the attention of the Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 We are monitoring efforts to alleviate the backlog very closely.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President has made clear to all of us he wants to see action on.</p>\n<p>Peter, then Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the Justice Department has complete autonomy in how it pursues or carries out leak investigations?\xc2\xa0 Or does the President believe there are some -- there is a balancing act between protecting the working rights of journalists and also getting to the bottom of leak investigations?\xc2\xa0 Has he shared his opinion with Attorney General Holder about how that balance should be struck?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that back in 2009 there was a letter from, I believe, the Attorney General and the ODNI in support of -- if my memory is correct -- in support of the media shield legislation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that reflects as a policy matter the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations to read out to you that the President has had in the past with the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 I think that that President\xe2\x80\x99s views are clearly expressed and have been for some time, since he was a senator.</p>\n<p>There are, as I understand it -- but I think you have to get this information more specifically from the Department of Justice -- rules and procedures that are followed in these matters.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s something not housed here.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just something I read in the paper.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up question.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the timeline issue, Congress is now looking into questions involving the IRS.\xc2\xa0 They want to know -- they\xe2\x80\x99re asking questions about what administration officials knew what when.\xc2\xa0 To what degree will the White House cooperate with these reviews and inquiries?\xc2\xa0 Will you share emails, provide witness testimony?\xc2\xa0 To what degree --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to anticipate how that would play out, excect to say that, as I said earlier and as others have said, that we believe that legitimate oversight in this matter is something that we will cooperate with, and should. We think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very serious issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the President has made clear, we think that it\xe2\x80\x99s wholly inappropriate that this conduct occurred regardless of the motivation.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we have some information about whether\xc2\xa0 -- what the motivation was or wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, based on the IG\xe2\x80\x99s report and his testimony.\xc2\xa0 But even if the motivation wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nefarious or partisan or political, it is still inappropriate conduct.\xc2\xa0 It is still not the kind of conduct that we can tolerate at the IRS, which is why the President has spoken out so clearly and why he\xe2\x80\x99s taken the action that he has.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Republicans on the Hill have said part of the reason the President may have found out when he did from media reports is to preserve deniability for him, that White House officials might have been interested in that.\xc2\xa0 Could you speak to that particular charge?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s an absurd suggestion.\xc2\xa0 It is entirely appropriate, as the White House Counsel did, to decide that this was not a matter to inform the President about.\xc2\xa0 It was an ongoing investigation or audit by the Inspector General into activity at the IRS.\xc2\xa0 It was past conduct -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important, too.\xc2\xa0 This was not something that could be that upon learning about, someone could have said, okay, we need to take action now because it\xe2\x80\x99s happening as we speak.\xc2\xa0 It was conveyed that this was past conduct that had ceased almost a year prior and, therefore, it was entirely appropriate to wait until there were the final results of the IG report before acting.\xc2\xa0 And, again, that is why the President found out from news reports, because those news reports occurred prior to the report actually being released.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not clear to me why senior staff wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was worthwhile to let the President know if there\xe2\x80\x99s something possibly politically explosive coming down the pipeline, and that, Mr. President, you ought to know that this is coming even though you can\xe2\x80\x99t act on it right now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that was a decision made, appropriately, by the White House Counsel that this was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say \xe2\x80\x9cappropriately.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did the President not feel, you should have told me about this kind of thing; it\xe2\x80\x99s coming down the pipeline --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you can prepare to act even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to act right away.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that was necessary to inform the President about.\xc2\xa0 It is not appropriate. Because, again, it begs the question, as you included in your question, okay, then what should he do?\xc2\xa0 And it would be inappropriate for him or anyone else here to take any action that would intervene in an ongoing investigative matter like the IRS audit of -- or rather, the IG audit of IRS activity.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it was the appropriate action to take to wait until the report came out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, I think that that -- it was conduct that had happened in the past.\xc2\xa0 It was not ongoing.\xc2\xa0 There was an indication at the topline level of what the findings would likely be, although the audit was not complete and those findings can and have changed in the past.\xc2\xa0 And once that report was released, the President acted very quickly and responded very quickly.\xc2\xa0 And it was not necessary or appropriate to inform him of an ongoing IG audit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of any information that was withheld from the President that he later said, hey, you should have let me know that was coming?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, last Monday you said that it was your understanding that the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office was alerted the week of April 22nd, this year, only about the fact that the IG was finishing a review about matters involving the office in Cincinnati.\xc2\xa0 But that now sounds more like what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office found out about on April 16th.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no -- look, matters involving -- that was shorthand -- \xe2\x80\x9cmatters involving the office in Cincinnati\xe2\x80\x9d -- in other words, the fact that there was conduct --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s sounds pretty topline.\xc2\xa0 And now you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the information was actually -- that the finding that line IRS employees had improperly scrutinized certain 501(c)(4)\xc2\xa0 organizations by using words like \xe2\x80\x9ctea party\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m making clear now what activity in Cincinnati -- because it had been reported already when I answered that question -- was very specifically about, as I just said, line IRS employees in Cincinnati improperly scrutinizing 501(c)(4) organizations by using words like \xe2\x80\x9ctea party\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The Counsel was further informed that the report had not yet been finalized, and the publication date of a report was uncertain but likely soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the extent of what the notification was.\xc2\xa0 In any case, the most important point is that that information was based on a report that -- a notification about a report that had not been concluded, and that no action could or should be taken until that report was concluded, which is why -- and no intervention -- which is why we adopted the posture we did, which was, in spite of the incoming from the press and others, we waited appropriately until the report was published before the President took action in response to the report.\xc2\xa0 Because up to that point, it was just press reports based on supposed leaks or partial leaks of a draft report from the IG.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what was the difference, really, between the information that was found out on April 24th and then the news reports on May 10th?\xc2\xa0 Because it was that information about the IRS using words like \xe2\x80\x9ctea party\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpatriot\xe2\x80\x9d to scrutinize these groups, and the President still waited the whole weekend to comment on this after --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He waited until he -- I mean, he was asked -- he had to make some general comment in response to a question, but we waited for a full response until we had a report.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re point is right -- it was basic information when the White House Counsel got it.\xc2\xa0 It was still basic information when it hit the news reports.\xc2\xa0 And our decision was that it would not be appropriate for the President of the United States to take action based on press reports on anonymously sourced leaks, partial leaks of a draft IG report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there was essentially three weeks between both of those times of getting that information from April 24th to May 10th.\xc2\xa0 And White House officials, senior staff, had had discussions, as you just said, about how to respond to it and what those preliminary findings would be.\xc2\xa0 So why did it seem like the White House, the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t better prepared to address this when it came out on May 10th?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the conversations were based on notification of this as yet, at that point, completed IG audit.\xc2\xa0 There were discussions about when that audit would be completed and what its potential findings might be.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, that kind of notification via Treasury comes when there is an expectation with a conclusion of a report that there might be interest in it at a congressional or media level.\xc2\xa0 But all of that is anticipating the release of a report and the reaction we might have to it.</p>\n<p>And, again, the initial disclosure of it on that Friday was not anticipated.\xc2\xa0 The report was not completed.\xc2\xa0 We were waiting until the report was completed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify, is it the Treasury General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office that tells the White House General Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office, or is it another channel from Treasury?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s correct, that that\xe2\x80\x99s how the notification happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not a question about an ongoing criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a question about the balance that the President says he wants to strike between press freedoms and national security interests.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see a circumstance in which a reporter soliciting information from a government source is committing a criminal act in doing so?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said to Chuck, that is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about what the President believes and it\xe2\x80\x99s valid.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we need to find this balance.\xc2\xa0 The President believes in and defends the First Amendment.\xc2\xa0 The President believes the press needs to be able to pursue investigative journalism.\xc2\xa0 The President also believes that, as Commander-in-Chief and as a citizen, that it is important that classified information that, if leaked, could be harmful to our national security and endanger the lives of Americans or those who are helping the United States must be taken seriously, that we cannot allow that to happen, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t take it seriously, there are consequences to that.</p>\n<p>And so that is the balance he seeks.\xc2\xa0 Asking me that question --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0 Who decides that harm?\xc2\xa0 If a government source wants to give it up they\xe2\x80\x99re making a judgment then and there as well --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\'t address the question about -- that goes specifically to a report today about an ongoing criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 I understand the interest in it, but it is just not appropriate for me, again, based on a news report, or in any case, to talk about an ongoing criminal investigation --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t think that\'s what I\'m asking.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- into what is being reported into a very serious leak.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t do it.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is where the President comes down broadly on these issues, as reflected not just in what he said last week but where he\xe2\x80\x99s been since he was a senator and the legislation that he supports -- that he supported and supports to this day.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as I think I said last week on the broad matter, I know because I\'ve spent time talking to him in general as a former reporter and as someone who works with him and for him now that he believes very strongly in the need for reporters to be able to pursue investigative journalism; that he believes that that balance has to be struck in a way that allows that freedom to take place.\xc2\xa0 But he also has to be mindful of the need to protect classified information because of our national security interests.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a non-ongoing criminal investigation --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you going to ask me about Myanmar?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m asking -- prior to your service here you were bureau chief of Time magazine -- one of your reporters just prior to you becoming bureau chief got caught in a leak investigation. What would you have said if the government told you that he had been involved in a crime for reporting on the Valerie Plame case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Peter, it\xe2\x80\x99s really --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking about -- talking about this as your years as a journalist.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand the interest because of my former occupation and I can tell you that I feel as the President does, very strongly in the need to ensure that we have a press that\'s able to pursue investigative journalism freely, but we also have to protect those national security interests that are at stake.</p>\n<p>And again, I think I mentioned what Director Mueller had said about one of the matters that\'s under discussion now.\xc2\xa0 This is serious -- these are serious issues.\xc2\xa0 In terms of procedures that are followed in their investigations, I have to refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who have the answers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about in 2005, should Matt Cooper have gone to jail for reporting --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a hypothetical based on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a hypothetical -- that was a very real case, a very real situation.\xc2\xa0 As bureau chief, what would you have said if the Department of Justice came to you and said Matt Cooper was going to jail because he --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying, what would I have said if they had said, and that\'s a hypothetical.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a very real case and they could have made the exact same logical leap that the Department of Justice seemed to have made in 2009 in this case --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Department of Justice ongoing criminal investigation into a specific matter that I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on.\xc2\xa0 And that case has been played out and written much about, including by Mr. Cooper and others, and the history of that is well known.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to extrapolate hypothetically about what might have happened in that and how it relates to an ongoing criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 But I think it was a great effort.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it fair to say, though, that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s view of this balance tilts extremely heavily towards the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest and away from the press\xe2\x80\x99s?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s called a balance.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just go back on the IRS to April 16?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the White House Counsel was given information in a series of items for her attention and that this was relatively routine to alert her, and then she discussed it with the White House Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up to make sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 If that series of items or any other series of items that was presented to her includes information about an IG report, it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire and the practice here that he is not notified of an IG report when it\xe2\x80\x99s underway until it\xe2\x80\x99s completed.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t tell you that, as a general matter, when there are ongoing investigations like this, the White House Counsel makes the call about whether or not, after she\xe2\x80\x99s been notified, who she should also alert.\xc2\xa0 And in this case -- and I think that it reflects a general approach when there is an ongoing investigation, or audit, as it is termed here, into a matter like this that was not complete, that it was not necessary or appropriate to notify the President.\xc2\xa0 Because we knew that that report would be concluded; we knew that there would potentially be changes in the report.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as a general matter, that can happen between -- in the final stages of an IRS audit -- I mean, IG audit in this case of the IRS.\xc2\xa0 And so that was the decision of Counsel and the recommendation of Counsel to others.</p>\n<p>But, truly, as a routine matter, this is not -- this is just -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of information that courses through a White House, and matters that rise to the level of presidential attention.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of decision-making that goes into that, and this was certainly not one that it was deemed appropriate or necessary to alert the President to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re saying, for audits or IG investigations, the President is sometimes informed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying -- you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to put words in my mouth, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to clarify.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get a general principle here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the Counsel, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure has been the case in past White Houses, makes a decision about what information, what notification that he or she receives merits conveying to the President or conveying to other senior staff.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, she made the judgment that it did not.</p>\n<p>And again, I think that the focus on this is interesting --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about the results --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but the focus on this is interesting because it does beg the question -- if there is criticism out there that the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t notified in advance, what is the suggestion, that he should have done something about it in advance?\xc2\xa0 Because --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m interested because --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- obviously that would wholly inappropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just interested because IG reports are not unusual, and members of Congress in this case requested this.\xc2\xa0 And my question is really about is the President always going to wear blinders if an IG report is going on?\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at.</p>\n<p>So in the last month -- I just want to make sure I understand -- when the President sat down every day with his Chief of Staff or he met with his Treasury Secretary, they understood in general what was happening with this particular issue and they never said anything to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s correct, beginning with April 24th, in terms of the White House Counsel and the Chief of Staff. Again, I think any examination of the previous three weeks, leading up to last week, would say that there was a lot of information that could be discussed in the meetings with the President, and there was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The President has a Legislative Affairs Director and you all monitor what goes on on the Hill very closely.\xc2\xa0 That\'s routine.\xc2\xa0 When a member of Congress requests an audit, an independent audit, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House customarily aware through the Legislative Affairs Office which members of Congress are requesting that and whether that was --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we have members of Congress come through the White House on their way to requesting action by inspectors general.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, but you monitor what they\'re doing, so --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that in that case that we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- I don\'t know as a broad matter how closely that\xe2\x80\x99s monitored.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say there are scores of ongoing inspector general audits and investigations happening as we speak, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, for instance, what Congressman Issa does, you do monitor pretty closely, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because a chairman like this is engaging directly with the White House and the administration, requesting information as part of an oversight matter.\xc2\xa0 That is different from asking or requesting an independent inspector general review or audit --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you don\'t know, though?\xc2\xa0 You just -- you don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking, just saying --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re kind of -- I\'m not sure of the point you\'re trying to make here.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of ongoing IG reviews happening and they\'re routine in the sense of their number.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have to do with very serious matters.\xc2\xa0 Some of them conclude that non-serious things happened.\xc2\xa0 This was obviously something that concluded that activity took place that, as the President views it, is entirely inappropriate, and that people need to be held accountable and we need to take action to ensure it doesn\'t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So one other clarification.\xc2\xa0 When you were gathering information last week -- just to follow up on what the front row was asking -- in what you could tell us about when the White House first knew about the IRS discussion and everything that you told us about the White House Counsel, I just want to make sure I understand -- you did, or you did not, know that she had also advised Denis McDonough, the Chief of Staff, and other senior members of the staff?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I knew at the time is, again, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said today, is that the White House Counsel, Kathy Ruemmler, was notified in the week of April 22nd.\xc2\xa0 I did find out that that specifically was April 24th, and that she notified other members of senior staff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about last week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t remember specifically.\xc2\xa0 But the point is, is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I knew it at that time.\xc2\xa0 But the point is Kathy Ruemmler is the point of contact here.\xc2\xa0 She made the decision or the judgment that it was not necessary or appropriate to inform the President of this, and that didn\'t happen.\xc2\xa0 And most importantly, no action was taken by anyone in this building to intervene -- because the focus here is on, well, if you know that, then what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did she tell staff they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, she didn\'t tell -- it was her judgment that it was not necessary to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the staff they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Alexis.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confused by --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This was a handful of staff, not the entire staff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question to you is, were you walled off from a fuller picture of what people knew and when they knew it last week as compared to today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then it was your choice, you chose --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously dealing with a lot of information here.\xc2\xa0 Last week we were focused intently on Benghazi and other matters, as well as this one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you only gave us a version?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just clarifying.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you that I have -- because of the confusion which has appeared and in the questions that have been asked, I gathered this information for you to provide you the kind of detail that I think you\'re interested in.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But going forward, is that going to be your practice?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, let me get to some other people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions -- on IRS and on the AP story and James Rosen story.\xc2\xa0 What rises to the level of the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention?\xc2\xa0 What merits the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention on items around here, since the IRS issue did not make that mark?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, since you asked that at least in the beginning in reference to ongoing criminal investigations, the President does not intervene in ongoing congressional investigations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he closely follows the media.\xc2\xa0 He understands a lot about a lot of issues and follows them closely. But again, last week there was this sort of insistence that -- the suggestion that the President should have been notified and done something about an ongoing criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 And I would suggest to you that that would truly be a story.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, that\'s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- what merits the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention around here?\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure how to answer that question. The President is attentive to scores of issues every day.\xc2\xa0 He is focused on his agenda that is designed to protect and grow the middle class, to help our economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 He is focused very intently on steps that need to be taken to ensure that our national security interests are protected.\xc2\xa0 Very specifically, in reaction to another matter, he wants to see congressional action to upgrade and fully fund security for our embassies and diplomatic facilities around the world.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of issues that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.</p>\n<p>In this matter, as I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said numerous times, it was not appropriate for him to engage in a criminal investigation or engage in an ongoing inspector\xe2\x80\x99s independent audit of the IRS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, now on the other issue, on the James Rosen/AP story -- what makes this country at this moment different from any other country that the President has gone to that monitors the press, and when he goes there saying he\xe2\x80\x99s calling for press freedoms?\xc2\xa0 What makes us different now than those countries?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have the First Amendment.\xc2\xa0 We have a great tradition of press freedom here.\xc2\xa0 The President supports that tradition, and he is a defender of the rights contained within the First Amendment.\xc2\xa0 He is a defender of the right of the press to pursue investigative journalism.\xc2\xa0 He is also, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, as President and as a citizen, insistent upon the need to make sure that classified leaks that can endanger our national security and endanger the lives of American men and women overseas be taken seriously.\xc2\xa0 And that is a balance that he seeks, and it is a balance reflected in the legislation that he has supported and supports today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that the process that he now supports is now hampered and people are not handling reporting and investigative journalism the way they used to prior to a couple of weeks ago?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that to the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m clear on a couple of things.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a couple from that back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m clear on two things.\xc2\xa0 One is, did the White House Counsel see the draft or any portion of it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the White House Counsel or any member of the senior staff who knew about this send back comment, advice, requests about the drafting of the final report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the violence in Iraq has hit a new high.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Maliki said today that he blames it partially on the sectarian war in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Do you worry that the inaction in Syria might drag the region in a bigger conflict?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that we strongly condemn the attacks perpetrated in Iraq over the past several days, and we are deeply concerned by the frequency and the nature of recent attacks including bombings today, attacks on Iraqi security forces in Anbar over the weekend, and a series of attacks on both Sunni and Shia neighborhoods and mosques.\xc2\xa0 The targeting of innocent people in an effort to sow instability and division is reprehensible.\xc2\xa0 Our condolences go out to the victims of these attacks and to their families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, U.S. officials in Baghdad and Washington were in contact with a wide range of senior Iraqi leaders to urge calm, and help resolve ongoing political and sectarian tensions. These talks have focused on specific steps to avoid further violence and resolve key issues peacefully through dialogue and the political process.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. remains committed to supporting Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s democratic system and urges Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to continue working toward a peaceful resolution of tensions through dialogue.</p>\n<p>In answer to your question, we remain deeply concerned about the rise of violent extremism and how it further endangers the future both of Syria and its neighbors.\xc2\xa0 And we call on those inside Syria and fleeing from Syria to refrain from sectarian retributions.\xc2\xa0 Sectarian reprisals play directly into the regime\xe2\x80\x99s hands and do not move closer to the inclusive post-Assad future that the Syrian people deserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to the international community when they say that the lack of action in Syria is more costly than the actual action?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think both of these issues are very serious.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the United States, as the largest provider of humanitarian aide and the largest provider of nonlethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, has acted and will continue to act in support of a transition in Syria to a post-Bashar al-Assad future.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with our partners and allies and we are working with the Syria opposition daily to help bring that about, and are constantly reviewing the options we have available to us to help bring that about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Myanmar, Myanmar.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Myanmar, in the back, yes.\xc2\xa0 All the way back.\xc2\xa0 Myanmar?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks -- because we do have an important state visit today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Myanmar.\xc2\xa0 As you just mentioned, you just called Burma Myanmar.\xc2\xa0 And also in a statement the day released by the White House called Burma as Myanmar.\xc2\xa0 What kind of signal are you trying to send out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me address that.\xc2\xa0 The United States government over time has begun to allow limited use of the name Myanmar as a diplomatic courtesy.\xc2\xa0 Burma has undertaken a number of positive reforms, including releasing over 850 political prisoners, easing media restriction, permitting freedom of speech, assembly and movement.\xc2\xa0 We have responded by expanding our engagement with the government, easing a number of sanctions, and as a courtesy in appropriate settings, more frequently using the name Myanmar.</p>\n<p>While we are not changing our policy to officially adopt Myanmar, we believe that showing respect for a government that is pursuing an ambitious reform program and a government that is pursing that agenda is an important signal of support for its efforts and our desire to help the transformation succeed.\xc2\xa0 But our policy remains that Burma is the name of the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, also many believe that the expansion of the U.S. influence in Myanmar is at the expense of China.\xc2\xa0 What kind of role the President is expecting Myanmar to play in his policy of rebalance to Asia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we are engaging with Myanmar in response to the meaningful steps in the right direction that has been taken in that country.\xc2\xa0 But we also recognize that reforms there are fragile and there are many additional steps that need to be taken to truly transition to democracy, including protecting the rights of all of the people of Burma including ethnic minorities, and ensuring that the military is subordinate to civilian oversight.</p>\n<p>We are obviously very much engaged in Asia, and we have talked about the rebalancing and the pivot toward Asia that is very much a focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 But engagement with Burma has to do with the specific actions taken and the meaningful steps taken in the right direction by the Burmese government.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:18 P.M.
