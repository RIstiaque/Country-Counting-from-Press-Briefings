Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:04 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0TGIF. \xc2\xa0The fourth of four consecutive briefings this week, which has been a pleasure. \xc2\xa0I hope today\xe2\x80\x99s goes well, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Week ahead? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do have a week ahead. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to jump right to it, if that\xe2\x80\x99s where we wanted to go. \xc2\xa0Let me do a short announcement at the top and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a least a couple of questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn December 17th, President Obama announced historic changes to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s Cuba policy, beginning the process of normalizing relations between our two countries. \xc2\xa0The embargo remains in effect, but over the past year the administration has worked to enhance trade and commerce with Cuba, and published regulatory changes to existing Cuba sanctions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce took additional steps to implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s new policy direction, announcing additional revisions to existing Cuba sanctions that will further advance our goal of empowering the Cuban people. \xc2\xa0The United States remains committed to our enduring objective of promoting a more prosperous Cuba that respects the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all its people. \xc2\xa0We believe the regulatory changes announced today will allow the United States to continue to advance our interests and improve the lives of ordinary Cubans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for more specific details about some of those technical changes, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Treasury and the Department of Commerce, respectively. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s an important step in advancing the policy changes that the President announced at the end of last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that out of the way, Darlene, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Great, thanks. \xc2\xa0Staying on Cuba, could you talk a little bit about why the administration thinks that now is the right time to do what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Cuba in terms of easing travel and making it easier for American citizens to do business there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Darlene, this is part of the policy process that the President envisioned and kicked off back in December of last year. \xc2\xa0For more than five decades, the policy -- the United States had pursued a policy of isolation against Cuba, and the thinking behind the implementation and strict enforcement of that policy was that by isolating Cuba we could compel them to change their habits when it comes to the government\xe2\x80\x99s respect for basic human rights. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for more than five decades, the Cuban government essentially ignored the policy of the United States, freely engaged with a variety of other countries around the hemisphere and around the world, and our efforts didn\xe2\x80\x99t have -- or didn\xe2\x80\x99t yield the kind of results we were looking for. \xc2\xa0And after five decades, or more than five decades of that policy, the President determined that it would be more effective for the United States to begin engaging not just the Cuban government, but also the Cuban people. \xc2\xa0And the goal of some of these policy changes is to deepen our engagement with the Cuban people. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll just cite one example. \xc2\xa0And this is something you can get more detail from the Treasury Department on. \xc2\xa0But some of the policy changes enacted today relate to telecommunications and Internet-based services. \xc2\xa0Ensuring that the Cuban people have greater access to information is one way that we can give them greater opportunity, certainly more exposure to the kinds of values that we prioritize in this country. \xc2\xa0And we believe that will be in the best interest of our goal of empowering the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What steps has Cuba taken or has told the administration it will take as part of this process of normalizing relations between the two countries? \xc2\xa0It seems like the U.S. is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s making all the moves.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the U.S. is certainly capitalizing on opportunities to take some of these steps. \xc2\xa0Obviously the business community here in the United States is strongly supportive of some of these steps that have been announced by the administration, including some of these regulatory changes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo while our principal goal here is empowering the Cuban people, there\xe2\x80\x99s an intended benefit for the American people too. \xc2\xa0It advances our interests in the hemisphere, and it certainly opens up some business opportunities for American businesses that are interested in capitalizing on the markets that exist in Cuba. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s also the potential that some of these changes would ease travel restrictions and make it a little bit easier for individuals to travel to Cuba. \xc2\xa0The embargo hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed; we still want Congress to take action to remove the embargo. \xc2\xa0But some of the regulatory changes would enhance people-to-people exchanges between the United States and Cuba. \xc2\xa0We believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the Cuban people, but there are benefits for Americans, as well. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s, again, a policy that would not have been possible had we continued to adhere to this failed policy of isolation that didn\xe2\x80\x99t advance our interests and didn\xe2\x80\x99t yield the kinds of changes on the island nation of Cuba that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0By now you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen clips on television of Donald Trump in New Hampshire, and the question he got from someone who said the President is a Muslim and is not an American. \xc2\xa0Are you surprised that that issue is still out there and still coming up after the President tried to put it to rest a few years ago by releasing his birth certificate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s funny the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve phrased your question. \xc2\xa0I had the opportunity to think through what my answer might be to this kind of question. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But I think my first observation is, is anybody really surprised that this happened at a Donald Trump rally? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been paying attention to Republican politics is at all surprised.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason for that is that the people who hold these offensive views are part of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s base. \xc2\xa0And Mr. Trump himself would be the first to tell you that he\xe2\x80\x99s got the biggest base of any Republican politician these days. \xc2\xa0Now, it is too bad that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to summon the same kind of patriotism that we saw from Senator McCain who responded much more effectively and directly when one of his supporters at one of his campaign events about seven years ago raised the same kind of false claims. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also unfortunate is that Mr. Trump isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first Republican politician to countenance these kinds of views in order to win votes. \xc2\xa0In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what every Republican presidential candidate is doing when they declined to denounce Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s cynical strategy, because they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for those same votes. \xc2\xa0Now, other Republicans have successfully used this strategy as well. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that one Republican congressman told a reporter that he was \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Duke without the baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0That congressman was elected by a majority of his colleagues in the House of Representatives to the third highest-ranking position in the House. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThose same members of Congress blocked immigration reform. \xc2\xa0Those same members of Congress oppose reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. \xc2\xa0Those same members of Congress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t support a simple funding bill because they\xe2\x80\x99re eager to defend the confederate flag. \xc2\xa0So those are the priorities of today\xe2\x80\x99s Republican Party, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be until someone in the Republican Party decides to summon the courage to stand up and change it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should Donald Trump apologize to the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not really -- I haven\'t seen any evidence to indicate that he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in my advice about what he should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0So I wanted to ask, Secretary Kerry said today in London that the U.S. believes that military talks with Russia regarding Syria are an important next step. \xc2\xa0And the Pentagon today said Secretary Carter spoke with the Russian Defense Minister. \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask, what are the plans for additional talks with Russia, and at what level do you expect them to occur? \xc2\xa0And what specific issues does the administration believe needs to be ironed out in these talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have hinted for a couple of days now that we believed there would be some value in some tactical, practical discussions with the Russians about how to advance the goals of our counter-ISIL operation, and to ensure the safe conduct of those anti-ISIL operations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecretary Carter did have the opportunity to speak to his Russian counterpart today. \xc2\xa0And they agreed in the context of those conversations to discuss further mechanisms for de-confliction in Syria, essentially making sure that the actions of our counter-ISIL coalition don\xe2\x80\x99t come into conflict with any Russian military actions that they may have planned for Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat one point that I think is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before but bears repeating, which is that Russia has long had a military presence inside of Syria because they essentially used Syria as a client state in the Middle East and they were an important part of propping up the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, we have seen the Assad regime become isolated, lose its legitimacy to lead that country, and according to many analysts, begin to lose its grip on power. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve described doubling down on Assad as a losing bet for Russia. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage Russia to find a constructive way to support ongoing counter-ISIL operations inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a separate issue, today a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that China is extremely concerned about the comments from Admiral Harry Harris that the U.S. should challenge some of China\xe2\x80\x99s claim for territory in the South China Sea by patrolling close to some of the artificial islands. \xc2\xa0China urged the U.S. not to take risky or provocative actions. \xc2\xa0What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to these concerns raised by China?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s comments so I can\xe2\x80\x99t respond to those directly. \xc2\xa0I can say as a general matter that we have long encouraged China to find a constructive, diplomatic way to work with other countries that have claims in the South China Sea to try to resolve the differences of opinion there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe stakes of resolving those tensions are not insignificant. \xc2\xa0The fact is, the South China Sea is a significant area when it comes to international trade; that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of international trade that moves through those waters. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of all the countries in that region of the world and it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of countries like the United States that have an impact on the global economy to ensure that those tensions don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with the free flow of commerce.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we have steadfastly urged the Chinese to do is to engage with other countries in that region to find a diplomatic resolution to some of these differences. \xc2\xa0And we are strongly supportive of the efforts of those other countries to find a diplomatic resolution with the Chinese.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know that with respect to Donald Trump and what happened at that rally, and the comments that you made, I know that you said that they are a reflection of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on inside the Republican Party and certainly at Donald Trump rallies. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a more deeply rooted issue here, and that this has been going on inside this country ever since Barack Obama was running for President. \xc2\xa0And what does it say about political culture in this country? \xc2\xa0And is it disappointing to the President to hear that this is still going on, months before he leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, I think the first thing the President would say is that there is a long history throughout American politics of a robust and in some cases quite tough rhetorical debate on a range of political issues. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not the toughness of the debate that the President is concerned about. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think more broadly the concern is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a variety of leaders in the Republican Party countenance offensive views just to try to win some votes. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s had a significant impact on the presidential race, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also had a significant impact on the ability of Congress to function effectively and to pass legislation like immigration reform that has broad bipartisan support across the country, would do good things for our economy, would reduce the deficit. \xc2\xa0But yet it\xe2\x80\x99s blocked by Republicans who countenance some of those views. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the point here is that this is a cynical strategy that too many Republican politicians have dabbled in because for some of them it\xe2\x80\x99s proved to be successful. \xc2\xa0But there are consequences for it. \xc2\xa0There are consequences for their ability to govern the country and there are consequences at the ballot box, too, because I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that voters are paying attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And apparently Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has said, well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the comment. \xc2\xa0What do you make of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not what he said. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And Hillary Clinton apparently said at one of her campaign events that if the Obama administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurry up with a decision on Keystone, she is going to let her feelings be known soon. \xc2\xa0What did you make of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, in some ways these Keystone questions are some of the easiest ones that I have to answer because, fortunately, all of you already know the answer to them, which is that there is an ongoing process at the State Department, where this particular project is being considered, that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the way that these infrastructure projects have been considered by previous administrations and it\xe2\x80\x99s why -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s the way that this administration is considering this project.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would acknowledge that this project -- the consideration of this project has taken longer than many previous projects. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of reasons for that, including that there are some -- litigation by some people would be affected by the construction of the pipeline that has delayed the consideration of this study that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted by the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for timing in terms of when this review will be completed, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she know that about the process since she was Secretary of State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that she does, but I think that she is also articulating a view that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from many of you, which is that you\xe2\x80\x99re eager to hear an answer. \xc2\xa0And as soon as we have one, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up just about the South China Sea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been -- I believe it was 2012 the last time U.S. warships passed through some of these disputed waters. \xc2\xa0And there was some suggestion at a Capitol Hill hearing yesterday that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the administration to send some more U.S. warships through those waters. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the response to that? \xc2\xa0Is it in consideration at least?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0For those kinds of operational decisions, Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99d send you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For goodness sake, Josh, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that would not happen without the President\xe2\x80\x99s say-so.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I was just going to say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that the Commander-in-Chief wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a view on that. \xc2\xa0But at least for questions about the last time that this occurred, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that information in front of me. \xc2\xa0The Department of Defense would have that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we have indicated is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for these kinds of disputes to be resolved diplomatically among the parties who are directly involved. \xc2\xa0And the United States has a clear stake in the peaceful resolution of those disputes because there are significant economic consequences for some of those differences of opinion having an impact on global trade. \xc2\xa0And there are significant -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant flow of U.S. products from the United States to markets in Asia and other places around the world that traverse those waters. \xc2\xa0And we want to make sure that that flow of commerce is not interrupted. \xc2\xa0It would have significant consequences for the U.S. economy and that\xe2\x80\x99s the stake that we have in resolving it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a policy position to share with you in terms of any upcoming operational decisions about the deployment of U.S. warships in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a policy matter the U.S. ought to be sending warships through those waters to assert the right of freedom of navigation? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, at this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional details about what may be in the works here.</p>\n<p>\n\tVictoria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the Trump-Muslim-Obama-non-American thing from a policy and political point of view, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to address it more from President Obama and how he feels about this personally at this point -- point of view. \xc2\xa0Does this annoy him? \xc2\xa0Does it irritate him? \xc2\xa0Does it amuse him? \xc2\xa0Does it flummox him? \xc2\xa0Is he upset about it? \xc2\xa0What is his response to it? \xc2\xa0It has gone on for years now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, well, I think that for that reason, because these are the kinds of questions that all -- many of us have had to answer in a variety of different settings, including on places like buses in Iowa, that I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all sort of long past being particularly concerned about them. \xc2\xa0I think that the bigger concern, and I think, frankly, the most relevant issue here is the frequency with which significant, influential players in Republican politics continue to countenance these views as they build political support. \xc2\xa0And that has consequences. \xc2\xa0It has consequences for the ability of a Republican majority in Congress to run the country, to pass common-sense legislation that has strong bipartisan support across the country. \xc2\xa0But it also has consequences in terms of the way that voters across the country view the Republican Party and view the candidates that are running under the Republican Party banner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why do you think that the view that President Obama is a Muslim of 43 percent in this latest CNN poll among Republicans just seems to be if not growing, at least staying the same, that it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tap down. \xc2\xa0Why do you think that is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have no idea. \xc2\xa0I have no idea.</p>\n<p>\n\tDevon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about the other part of the Trump controversy. \xc2\xa0His campaign, as Jim said, says he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the question but also that the questioner, who is kind of in the spotlight here, mentioned Muslim terrorist training camps preceding his question, so they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that Mr. Trump was referring to wanting to get rid of these Muslim terrorist training camps. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have any view on these supposed camps? \xc2\xa0Are there Muslim terrorist training camps in this country, in your view?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anybody produce any evidence to substantiate the claim that there are. \xc2\xa0So I guess you could say that I think the vast majority of Americans would take a rather dim view of those views.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And Hillary Clinton today, she\xe2\x80\x99s campaigning in New Hampshire. \xc2\xa0She said a couple times talking about the economy that she believes the economy is stalled and it\xe2\x80\x99s stalled domestically. \xc2\xa0She used that word a couple times today for the first time. \xc2\xa0Is it the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view that the economy is stalled?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not. \xc2\xa0I think you heard the President talk about this at the Business Roundtable earlier this week that our economy has made really important progress since recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression; that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of the longest, sustained stretch of private-sector job growth in the history of the country. \xc2\xa0And whether you evaluate our progress by looking at job creation, the unemployment rate that\xe2\x80\x99s been cut nearly in half since its peak five or six years ago, if you take a look at GDP growth, even despite the volatility in the financial markets, even the stock market has rebounded significantly from the depths of the economic recession.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s true is that the President believes that there is a whole lot more than can and should be done to advance our recovery and make sure that more middle-class families are benefitting from it. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that. \xc2\xa0In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of our principal arguments about why Republicans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t follow through with threatening to shut down the government. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying the significant progress and momentum that our nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy has built up. \xc2\xa0In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s why our economy right now is the envy of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does it trouble the White House, though, that she\xe2\x80\x99s out there saying -- pushing the view that\xe2\x80\x99s so contrary to what you just said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not particularly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And real quickly, just on her comments on the Keystone pipeline. \xc2\xa0Setting aside the whole process, her question, wanting to put the White House on notice so to suggest that it\xe2\x80\x99s your view, the White House view, that perhaps she show deference to the President before she announces her view. \xc2\xa0Is there any indication from the White House that she should wait to say what she thinks about this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been, on a number of occasions, been given the opportunity to offer campaign advice to the Clinton campaign, and I have a lot of good friends and colleagues who are slaving away on that campaign and they don\xe2\x80\x99t need advice from me.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a preference as to when she makes her declaration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that she is entitled to make her own decisions about what she says in the context of her campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Your counterpart in Moscow today said that Russia would be willing to consider sending combat troops into Syria if they were requested by the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, first, if that was an issue that was discussed directly in Ash Carter\xe2\x80\x99s phone call today. \xc2\xa0And then more broadly, kind of on this outreach effort, why sort of in light of what happened in Ukraine you guys find this dialogue with Russia helpful and why you think there is some reason for optimism in discussing with President Putin these issues and trying to get him to deescalate this conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more details about Secretary Carter\xe2\x80\x99s telephone call that I can share with you. \xc2\xa0I think it is notable that the kind of military-to-military cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to restart here is cooperation at a practical, tactical level. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously different than the kind of military-to-military cooperation between our two countries that was in place prior to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s inappropriate and unjust interference in eastern Ukraine. \xc2\xa0So our goal here is to pursue this practical cooperation to try to advance the interests of our anti-ISIL coalition and to try safeguard as much as possible the operations that are underway as a part of that mission inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Switching topics. \xc2\xa0French diplomats have said that Ban Ki-moon and other U.N. officials are trying to organize a conference of 40 world leaders, including the President, on the day before UNGA to talk about climate change. \xc2\xa0I know that you haven\'t formally the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can talk about whether the President would be attending that, and a little bit about if you see that as important in the buildup to Paris.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule yet, but we should have more details on that soon. \xc2\xa0What I can say is that the United States, and certainly the President, does believe that the United Nations has played and will continue to play an important coordinating function in trying to bring the world together to make some significant commitments to fight climate change. \xc2\xa0And there are talks that are scheduled for the end of this year in Paris, where leaders or representatives of nations will come hopefully ready to make some serious commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States, in coordination with China, has made some significant commitments. \xc2\xa0The Chinese have made significant commitments to reducing carbon pollution in the context of those talks as well. \xc2\xa0There are other countries, like South Korea and Mexico, that have also announced steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s the policy of this administration that those talks in Paris could serve as a very important catalyst for eliciting commitments from countries around the world, thus making an important contribution to reducing carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0So there clearly is an important role for the United Nations to play here, and the United States has been playing, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, a leading role in encouraging countries around the world to make significant commitments in the context of those talks. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we obviously are strongly supportive of the process that\xe2\x80\x99s being run by the United Nations. \xc2\xa0We are taking an active role to try to ensure its success, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of important work that needs to get done. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary in New York next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0After attending that after a couple of days -- after the meeting with Senator Reid and Leader Pelosi yesterday, you guys said that you\xe2\x80\x99d back a CR. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if a requirement for that CR would be reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, if that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of the concrete principle that you guys are holding.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any contingencies to add on here. \xc2\xa0What we are seeking to do is to find a way to get Republicans in Congress to accept the invitation that\xe2\x80\x99s been on the table from Democrats for months now to engage in bipartisan talks to try to resolve the budget standoff. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken what I think is merely a realistic approach to acknowledging the facts, which is that Republicans have put off these talks for so long that it now is difficult to imagine that they\xe2\x80\x99d be able to reach a bipartisan budget agreement before the deadline.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, that said, the President\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to locking in the sequester is steadfast. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I would not envision a long extension of funding at current levels, but rather enough time for Congress to finally convene the talks, reach an agreement, and implement it, thereby avoiding a government shutdown but also ensuring that our national security and economic priorities are properly funded.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last quick one on Hillary, since she seems to be in vogue today. \xc2\xa0I noticed yesterday in the briefing you said that sort of what had been going on with the Syrian -- the training of Syrian rebels was an indication that those who had been kind of pushing arming the Syrian rebels was the solution to the process there had been wrong, and you said that it was time for them to sort of admit it. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if Secretary Clinton is one of those people who you think should be kind of admitting after this that she\xe2\x80\x99d been wrong on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making is that there are some -- and I would not put Secretary Clinton necessarily in this category. \xc2\xa0There are some who have suggested that this essentially the only necessary part of the strategy for success inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Secretary Clinton describe her position, but I think that she -- I feel confident in saying that she, while she was in office and serving under the President, was supportive of the kind of multilayered approach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pursuing inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s everything from airstrikes in support of operations on the ground; some support for opposition groups inside of Syria that have made important progress against ISIL there; trying to prioritize the counter-financing operations to essentially shut off the strategies that ISIL uses to fund their activities. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been actively working with our allies to -- and our partners to try to stop the flow of foreign fighters to Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is an important multifaceted strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to implement here. \xc2\xa0One aspect of that strategy has been a training-and-equipping operation. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned earlier, that is something that has proved to be even more difficult than we expected, despite the important cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from some other countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the reason that I have cited this is that we have frequently found that our most ardent critics when it comes to the situation in Syria have very little to say when asked about alternative policies that they think would work better. \xc2\xa0And the most frequently mentioned one is typically a backward-looking suggestion that we should have at an earlier date been more aggressive about providing arms to fighters, and seeking to train and equip more of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that it would have been unwise to provide that kind of assistance without thoroughly vetting and getting to know the individuals who would be receiving it. \xc2\xa0And there are good historical lessons to be learned about the value of being responsible when providing that kind of assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s an independent report out today that says the VA needs a \xe2\x80\x9csystem-wide reworking.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The report says that the VA has significant flaws, including the blow to bureaucracy, problems with leadership, and a potentially unsustainable capital budget. \xc2\xa0Can I get the White House reaction to this report?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron, I haven\'t seen the report. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, though, that it\xe2\x80\x99s some 1,400 pages long. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comprehensive response to offer you. \xc2\xa0I will just say, as a general matter, the President has made it a priority to ensure that America\xe2\x80\x99s veterans are getting the kind of health care and benefits that they have so richly earned. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President and this administration have implemented a variety of reforms, including the nomination of Bob McDonald to the VA Secretary. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that had a particular experience in the private sector when it comes to customer service and understanding processes and operations to try to streamline and reform the processes at the VA. \xc2\xa0And the early metrics of the reforms that he\xe2\x80\x99s put in place are encouraging. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress. \xc2\xa0But the President, Secretary McDonald and other senior officials at the VA are not going to rest until we have accomplished our goal of making sure that all of our veterans are getting the kind of care and benefits that they deserve on time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know you were asked about this yesterday, but we reported today that a transgender Catholic activist, an outspoken nun, and a gay episcopal bishop will all be here at the White House for the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xc2\xa0Is the White House trying to make a statement by inviting these folks? \xc2\xa0Is the White House planning on raising any LGBT issues with the Pope when he\xe2\x80\x99s here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron, I think the goal here is to invite up to 15,000 people to the South Lawn of the White House and the Ellipse to welcome the Pope to the White House. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s been overwhelming interest in attending that ceremony. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with religious organizations, including some Catholic organizations, to distribute tickets to that event. \xc2\xa0And we would expect a wide variety of Americans, who are enthused about the opportunity, to see the Pope. \xc2\xa0And I think that reflects the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s stature and the significance of his visit, and the way that he has inspired so many Americans, including a bunch of us that aren\xe2\x80\x99t Catholic. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I would expect that there would be a diverse crowd on the South Lawn of the White House and on the Ellipse to attend that ceremony. \xc2\xa0And again, I think the diversity of that crowd reflects the diversity of people in this country that are moved by the teachings and actions of this Pope.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the power to determine oil export rules properly belongs at the Commerce Department. \xc2\xa0Is that correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If my memory serves, didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President propose eliminating the Commerce Department? \xc2\xa0And if he still supports that plan, what agency does he think that power belongs to, or should belong to? \xc2\xa0And why not Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron, I believe what the President proposed several years ago is merging the Commerce Department with a number of other government agencies that have I think what you could call overlapping jurisdictions. \xc2\xa0And this is a process that I think got started over at OMB, I believe -- they started taking a look at this. \xc2\xa0But ironically we\xe2\x80\x99ve run into some pretty stiff congressional opposition to putting in place what I think otherwise could be described at some pretty common-sense reforms. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe goal of making those changes is not to shirk basic governmental responsibility, like determining the policies about oil exports, but rather to make sure that those policies are made and coordinated more efficiently. \xc2\xa0And that was the goal of that particular proposal, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made much progress in the face of stiff opposition from Republicans in Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But under those common-sense reforms, where would the power to determine oil exports go, do you know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Presumably it would -- I haven\'t looked at specific proposals in quite some time. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there was a proposal to move it to another existing agency, or if that authority would reside in the newly formed agency.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you mentioned the Business Roundtable speech a little while ago. \xc2\xa0In that speech, President Obama stressed that the deficits have come down on his watch, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the extent to which the national debt has risen on his watch. \xc2\xa0In fact, he rarely mentions the debt. \xc2\xa0Is that an oversight, or does he not fear that is a heavy burden on the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Mark, what most economists and the President are focused on is the sustainability of the debt. \xc2\xa0And that is why we have been so focused on driving down the deficit to try to get to a level that is sustainable compared to the overall size of the economy. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that we have regularly made. \xc2\xa0I know that case has often fallen on deaf ears when talking to some Republicans about this. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, the best way for us to pursue a responsible budget approach is to make smart spending decisions that reduces the deficit down to a sustainable level without shortchanging the kinds of investments that are so critical to overall economic growth. \xc2\xa0That overall economic growth is significant to preserving some fiscal stability. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made remarkable progress over the President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in office in reducing the deficit by nearly two-thirds at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does President Obama believe the debt is sustainable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, Mark, what economists tell us is that getting the debt and deficit -- or getting the deficit down to this level below three percent does sort of put us on a sustainable trajectory, and will allow us to continue to make smart investments that we know are critical to economic growth while at the same time ensuring that we\'re making responsible fiscal decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another subject, in an interview this week with \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d President Rouhani was asked about the oft used chant by Iranians, \xe2\x80\x9cdeath to America,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said it\'s not aimed at the American people, but American policies. \xc2\xa0Do you believe that? \xc2\xa0Does that give you any source for comfort?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t seen the entire interview at this point, so I think I\'ll withhold judgment on that until we get a chance to see the interview. \xc2\xa0But I think it\'s going to air on Sunday night, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s the free plug. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0Just a quick one on UNGA, and you talked a little bit earlier about making agreements with China on climate change. \xc2\xa0Have you made any headway in conversations with other emerging economies, large economies, like Brazil and India, ahead of Paris, in particular?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have an update on the status of deliberations in those other countries. \xc2\xa0I think that we\'ve been quite clear that when the President has met with the leaders of those countries this is an issue that rates highly on their agenda. \xc2\xa0The President traveled to India at the beginning of this year and climate change was among the topics that was discussed between the two leaders. \xc2\xa0And you saw at the news conference that President Obama convened with President Rousseff where they talked about the importance of continued U.S.-Brazilian cooperation when it comes to steps that would address climate change and reducing carbon pollution.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo these issues are certainly on the agenda at the presidential level, and I know that there are other conversations between officials in our countries and those countries that you mentioned about this topic that are ongoing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know we\'ve also talked a little bit in here about so-called manipulation of intelligence information. \xc2\xa0Recently we heard from the head of the House Intelligence Committee that he believes that as far back as 2012, intelligence may have been manipulated. \xc2\xa0Any response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, what we are focused on is dealing in facts and in evidence, and that\'s exactly what the Inspector General is taking a look at. \xc2\xa0 And so I\'m going to withhold judgment on that until the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s work has been completed. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll just restate the principle that I\'ve stated before, which is that this President and senior members of his team are not interested in cooked-up numbers or doctored facts; they\xe2\x80\x99re actually interested in ground truth because that is what will best serve the policymaking and decision-making process that the President takes quite seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And simply for the record, without qualification, no one in this administration exerted any pressure on anyone at the intelligence level to shade or create an environment that was in any way inaccurate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m certainly not aware of anything like that. \xc2\xa0Certainly the President wouldn\'t approve of anything like that. \xc2\xa0But again, I don\'t even think that\'s the accusation that the Inspector General is investigating at this point. \xc2\xa0The Inspector General, I believe -- it the Department of Defense Inspector General that is considering actions that may or may not have been taken by a range of officials inside the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any accusations that have been made against White House officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just two more, real quick. \xc2\xa0H.R.3504 says it would impose new legal requirements related to the provision of abortion services in certain circumstances which would likely have a chilling effect, reducing access to care -- that was part of a statement that you all made about the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. \xc2\xa0I just want to ask you about your statement -- it would likely have a chilling effect on access. \xc2\xa0Do you have any empirical evidence to prove that? \xc2\xa0Or is there something that you\'re pointing to specifically and you can say that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do think that is the assessment of many public health professionals who have taken a look at this, that essentially this kind of legislation could serve to put some health care providers out of business, and those are health care providers that many families rely on on a regular basis. \xc2\xa0So we can refer you to a health care expert that may have more specific explanation to describe to you if you would like.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And because it\'s Friday, I always like to throw a sports question in there. \xc2\xa0You\'re a Kansas City guy, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yeah. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So how about that loss to the Broncos last night? \xc2\xa0Any words for the down-trodden folks in Kansas City after suffering what had to be a brutal loss last night? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think \xe2\x80\x9cbrutal\xe2\x80\x9d is the way to describe it. \xc2\xa0It was quite disappointing. \xc2\xa0I think what I would say is that I think it\'s after tough losses like that that character is revealed. \xc2\xa0And I think we\'re going to learn about this team in the next couple of weeks, and how they respond to it I think will give us a very good indication of how optimistic we can be about the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ll be tuning in on Monday to see how they fare against the Packers. \xc2\xa0Next Monday, of course.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, if that\'s how you measure character, as a lifelong Cleveland fan, I just want to say I have a lot of it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But that\'s neither here nor there. \xc2\xa0Let me ask about the meeting yesterday, 90 minutes of the leaders and the President. \xc2\xa0When they came out, Nancy Pelosi suggested that she was still optimistic about a budget deal, and Harry Reid kind of joked that he\xe2\x80\x99s always on the other end of the spectrum. \xc2\xa0And I wonder where the President is -- is he closer to Nancy Pelosi right now, or Harry Reid on prospects for a deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say that I think right now the President is in the mode of trying to find some cause for optimism. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Successfully trying to find --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\'s still a work in progress. \xc2\xa0The President is -- we know -- and again, when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I don\'t just mean the President and me; I mean that anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been observing these sort of budget battles over the years, we know how to solve this problem and we know what it takes to avoid a government shutdown and to make the kind of bipartisan compromises that are so clearly in the best interests of the country and our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the best way to reach those compromises is for Democrats and Republicans to sit down together in good faith and broker a compromise. \xc2\xa0And it will yield a compromise that I feel confident in predicting will have me saying things like, \xe2\x80\x9cthis piece of legislation is not perfect, but the President is prepared to sign it because he knows that it\'s good for the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And my counterparts on the other side of the aisle can certainly say the same thing. \xc2\xa0That\'s what we\'re looking for here. \xc2\xa0We\'re not looking for the perfect piece of legislation. \xc2\xa0We\'re just looking for the kind of bipartisan compromise that prevents a government shutdown, that adequately funds our national security priorities, and makes sure that we\'re not shortchanging the kinds of investments that are critical to the success of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s the recipe. \xc2\xa0That\'s the package. \xc2\xa0And it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard to find some bipartisan common ground on that. \xc2\xa0I would acknowledge that the devil is in the details and we\'re going to have some differences of opinion about how to implement those priorities. \xc2\xa0But if we\'re guided by those priorities and we\'re guided by the best interests of the American people, then a budget agreement should be achievable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I guess that puts -- let me say, I think that at least puts me in the optimism camp.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are 12 days to go, though, and a lot of that time they\xe2\x80\x99ll just have -- the House is scheduled not to be in session. Do you have any doubt that this is going to go down to the wire, to the 29th or 30th?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that is typical of Congress that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait until the very last minute before they make a decision. \xc2\xa0So I would not be surprised if we\'re a day or two before the deadline and we\'re still waiting on Congress to pass legislation to at least prevent a shutdown. \xc2\xa0But what we\'re interested in -- and as Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi indicated yesterday, we\'re willing to go along with a short-term CR to give members of Congress time to negotiate a budget agreement, but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require that much time. \xc2\xa0And what it will require, though, is a willingness on the part of Republicans to actually sit down at the negotiating table with Democrats. \xc2\xa0That\'s something they\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to do thus far. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one on another topic. \xc2\xa0The President tweeted a couple days ago about the 14-year-old Muslim boy and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCool clock.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And you stood at the podium and talked about people examining their conscience and unreasoned prejudice. \xc2\xa0And I\'m wondering -- not to overly conflate things -- but in refusing to make any comment when the audience member said what he said yesterday, last night, did Donald Trump show prejudice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\'t think I\'m going to opine on that. \xc2\xa0I think what he did show is a willingness to countenance the offensive views of at least one member of his audience in order to try to win political support for his campaign. \xc2\xa0And we have seen far too many leaders in the Republican Party successfully use that strategy in a rather cynical way. \xc2\xa0 And pursuing that kind of strategy has consequences. \xc2\xa0And it has consequences when it comes to trying to govern the country, and it has consequences when your name is on the ballot and you\'re being considered by the voters.</p>\n<p>\n\tJerome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President of France has now officially or formally invited all world leaders for the heads of state summit that will take place at the very beginning of the climate conference in Paris. \xc2\xa0Will the President attend that summit, which is scheduled for November 30th?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jerome, at this point, I don\'t have travel plans for the President to announce yet. \xc2\xa0Obviously you heard me earlier when I talked about important the President and the administration believes those climate talks are, but I don\'t have any updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel schedule at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he have reservations about the summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I think the President is hopeful about the prospects for the summit. \xc2\xa0But it\'s going to require a lot of hard work. \xc2\xa0It\'s going to require a serious commitment on the part of countries around the world to this effort, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of important work to be done. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel, I just don\'t have any updates quite yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tSteve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0So Secretary of State John Kerry was talking about not having a long-term presence of Assad as the President of Syria. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if the President -- our President -- would consider that to be anything -- if Assad is still President of Syria when the President leaves office in a year and a half, would that be long term? \xc2\xa0Is there any scenario where he could countenance Assad staying in office past him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Steve, ultimately the view of our policy position is simply that President Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s lost legitimacy to lead that country because he has shown a willingness, even a propensity, for using the military might of that country to carry out terrible acts of violence against the Syrian people. \xc2\xa0The kinds of atrocities that we\'ve seen are stomach-turning. \xc2\xa0And it has led to a whole domino effect of consequences that have greatly destabilized that region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve seen extremist groups, including ISIL but not just ISIL, operate much more freely in that country. \xc2\xa0We have seen millions of Syrians flee their homes, trying to escape violence. Many of those Syrians are still inside of Syria; they\xe2\x80\x99re just internally displaced. \xc2\xa0Millions of other Syrians have had to leave the country entirely in search of refuge. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of those things, all those terrible things are a consequence of President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why, for years, the administration position has been that he should leave. \xc2\xa0That\'s also why the administration has readily acknowledged that, for all of our military activities inside of Syria, which are critical to our strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL, and critical to protecting the American people, we know that ultimately the solution is a diplomatic one that brings about the kind of political transition inside of Syria that\'s long overdue. \xc2\xa0Only by putting in place more stable, effective and legitimate leadership inside of Syria are we going to address the root cause of so many of these problems that plague the Middle East right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard similar statements from the podium for three or four years now --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- and the complete failure of the train-and-equip mission and any sign that Assad is going to leave, is there anything that gives this President or this White House any confidence that come January 20th, 2017, Assad is not going to still be there, still in power, propped up by Russia, while the President is off with his library? \xc2\xa0Is there anything that he is doing, any new look at revamping his strategy that would get Assad out of power before that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President has readily acknowledged for some time that our involvement in the anti-ISIL coalition is a long-term proposition. \xc2\xa0And he is mindful of the fact that we will make progress and we have made important progress, including on the ground inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also sustained some setbacks. \xc2\xa0And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on is to try to take the steps that we believe are immediately necessary to protect the American people, to try to reduce the ability of ISIL to project power into Iraq and destabilize that country. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been very supportive of the U.N.-led effort to try to facilitate political transition inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere have been a number of starts and stops associated with that diplomatic effort, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it get the kind of traction that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see, but the United States remains engaged in that process and strongly supportive of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have not heard any sort of tangible thing that\xe2\x80\x99s different, that\xe2\x80\x99s new, whether it be we finally found a rebel force that is a moderate force that we can give arms that would change the facts on the ground -- or the boots on the ground that you\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that we need in Syria. \xc2\xa0I have not seen anything that would give us clout or leverage with Vladimir Putin, who is sending troops and planes to Syria today that would get them to change their calculus. \xc2\xa0Is there anything tangible, or is the President asking his team for give me some tangible thing that would give us new leverage on the ground in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Steve, that there have been profound changes inside of Syria in the last year. \xc2\xa0Over the last -- all within the last year, the President built an anti-ISIL coalition of more than 60 nations. \xc2\xa0That included four or five Muslim-majority nations in the region that are carrying out airstrikes alongside military -- American military pilots inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have seen effective coordination with Syrian Arabs, Syrian Turks -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- Syrian Kurds, Turkomen, and other local fighters on the ground in Syria that, when supported by the coalition, including through military airstrikes, has succeeded in moving ISIL off of some 17,000 square kilometers of area that was populated that they\xe2\x80\x99d previously controlled that they now can no longer freely operate in.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been strikes that have been carried out by the U.S. military, including one operation inside of Syria that resulted in the death of a senior ISIL official and the exploitation of large reams of information that have given us more insight into operations inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of important progress in building relationships inside of Syria, by working closely with those that are operating on the ground, and that has resulted in ISIL sustaining some significant losses both on the ground and among the ranks of their leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but I\xe2\x80\x99m really asking about Assad. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m imagining that Assad sees those reports and is cheering them on, that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why he is allowing our planes to go in uncontested and he is happy that we\xe2\x80\x99re bombing ISIL because they hate Assad, too. \xc2\xa0I mean, you said yesterday that you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with Russia taking on ISIL but not propping up Assad, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t both things reality if they are going to join the coalition? \xc2\xa0If they are going to carry out bombing missions against ISIL, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that de facto helping out Assad keep him in power?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve long acknowledged that there is an impact or there\xe2\x80\x99s a connection between these two policy goals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated. \xc2\xa0The first policy goal is that Assad has lost legitimacy leading the country and should leave, and the second policy goal is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0Those two things are not unrelated, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have readily acknowledged.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is clear is that the most significant, urgent, destabilizing aspect of this crisis situation inside of Syria is the growth and continued violence that\xe2\x80\x99s being carried out by ISIL. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such a strong focus on our military actions, including military airstrikes against ISIL, coordination with ground forces taking the fight to ISIL, the efforts to shut down their financing and to stem the flow of foreign fighters. \xc2\xa0That is why that particular priority has attracted a lot of interest. \xc2\xa0But it has not diminished in any way our interest in trying to bring about the long overdue political transition that\xe2\x80\x99s needed inside of Syria because we know our ultimate success in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL will require legitimate and effective leadership inside of Syria that reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, does the President bear any responsibility for the fact that this strategy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked for year after year after year? \xc2\xa0Does he have some regret, have some sense that he should have found a better solution, something that would have created a situation where Assad would have left by now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Steve, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99re highlighting one of the significant challenges here -- that there is this desire on the part of a lot of people, particularly the President\xe2\x80\x99s critics, to suggest that the mess inside of Syria is somehow the fault of the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0But they do that without offering any sort of recommendation about what the President can or should do instead of what he\xe2\x80\x99s already doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe one thing that we frequently hear from people is that, well, you should really have invested significantly more in a train-and-equip operation. \xc2\xa0And, frankly, pinning all of our hopes on a train-and-equip operation was not going to be a smart strategy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President insisted that once that strategy was pursued, that it be effectively integrated with the other elements of our strategy. \xc2\xa0And what the Department of Defense is continuing to do is to evaluate that program and determine what sort of changes could be made to the program so that we can get some better results.</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to go back to Ahmed Mohamed, the teenager invited to the White House. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s another teenager who was more and more popular on YouTube who criticized the President, claiming he has a pro-Muslim bias, saying when cops are killed, their families are not invited to the White House. \xc2\xa0This woman in California was presumably killed by an illegal immigrant, her family was not invited to the White House, but in this case, oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a Muslim, he is invited by the White House. \xc2\xa0How does the White House react to this kind of accusation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the video so I hesitate to comment on it in any direct way. \xc2\xa0As it relates to the families of police officers who have been killed in the line of duty, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the President did speak at the Peace Officers Memorial up at the Capitol earlier this year and had the opportunity to greet many of the families there that were honoring the memory of their loved ones who had been killed in the line of duty. \xc2\xa0The President was proud to participate in that ceremony, as he has in years past.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s controversy yesterday again. \xc2\xa0You repeated several times during the briefing that the Republicans have successfully -- successful, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last word you used, used that strategy. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re successful in using it just in how it works, that somehow there\xe2\x80\x99s something right.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly has for Mr. Trump if you take a look at his polls. \xc2\xa0Again, he\xe2\x80\x99d be the first one to --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the American people feel there is something there. \xc2\xa0I mean, the administration hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to break this impression that Muslims are gaining in the U.S., the President is Muslim, and all this. \xc2\xa0If they\xe2\x80\x99re successful, as you acknowledge, it\xe2\x80\x99s because there is something that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to do to convince the American people that it\xe2\x80\x99s not there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what it is, is that we have seen a variety of leaders in the Republican Party, including the third highest-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, engage in a cynical strategy to win votes. \xc2\xa0And in many cases, by countenancing the offensive views of a minority in this country have succeeded in building large and durable bases of political support. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem is, is there are consequences for it. \xc2\xa0And those consequences take a variety of forms. \xc2\xa0One of them is in the approval rating of Republicans in Congress. \xc2\xa0Another is of the pieces of common-sense legislation that the vast majority of Americans would be good for the country that Republicans are not able to pass and, in some cases, actively block -- like when it comes to immigration reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know the truth is, the kind of people who can speak to this probably more persuasive than I can are the leaders in the Republican Party here in Washington, D.C., at least one of whom actually commissioned a report after the last election to try to figure out how to solve these problems. \xc2\xa0It may raise some questions about what impact that report has had, but the fact is, there is an awareness among some in the Republican Party of this significant problem that they have; that this cynical strategy has yielded some short-term benefits for some individual leaders in the Republican Party. \xc2\xa0But there are consequences for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a follow-up on that. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s a cynical strategy to win votes. \xc2\xa0Is it a strategy of hate? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what it is -- it is a strategy to countenance offensive views in an effort to try to curry favor with some segment of the voting population. \xc2\xa0And it is clear that\xe2\x80\x99s what Mr. Trump was doing. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear that\xe2\x80\x99s what his competitors in the Republican primary are doing when they refuse to denounce his cynical strategy. \xc2\xa0So, again, there is a significant challenge that\xe2\x80\x99s resting with the leaders of the Republican Party right now and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what their priorities are. \xc2\xa0And at some point, if the leaders of that party or the members of that party are interested in changing it, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require somebody to summon some courage and stand up and speak out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the view of President Obama of Muslims all over the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President I think has spoken to this on a number of occasions, including a speech that he delivered in Cairo early on in his presidency. \xc2\xa0I would note that even President Bush over the course of his presidency went to great lengths to make clear that the American people and the West was not at war with Islam. \xc2\xa0And there is some evidence that we have gathered from some of the documentation that was recovered in Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound that the successful -- that successful messaging was undermining the strategy of al Qaeda; that the strategy of al Qaeda was predicated on starting a holy war between Muslims around the world and the West.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\xe2\x80\x99s why President Bush deserves credit, both from a strategic perspective, but also from a perspective of the values that the vast majority of the American people share. \xc2\xa0I mean, he won two national presidential elections. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that some of the leaders in the Republican Party now are pursuing a different strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tFred.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just on the same topic. \xc2\xa0You talked about the cynical strategy that panders to -- among Republicans leaders. \xc2\xa0And you mentioned specifically Donald Trump and Steve Scalise. \xc2\xa0If it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the party -- who are some of the others that have engaged in this strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I would ascribe some blame to Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s competitors.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The entire GOP presidential field?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at least those that have refused to -- or declined to denounce his cynical strategy. \xc2\xa0And the reason for that -- they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it for the same reason that he is, which is they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win votes. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- as I mentioned earlier, that stands in pretty stark contrast to the patriotism of somebody like Senator McCain, faced with a similar situation in the middle of a presidential campaign, in a town hall meeting, there was somebody that popped up and started saying to him the same things that Donald Trump heard last night, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall Senator McCain had the microphone taken away from that person. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s character, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also a testament to the kinds of questions that are facing Republican leaders right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh, I appreciate it. \xc2\xa0Josh, how concerned is the President and this administration that among the massive refugee population that is now making headway through Europe, that there could be, in fact, members of al Qaeda, ISIL, or those who could be trained by those organizations whose main objective is to get a stronghold in Europe and do significant damage? \xc2\xa0And I have a follow-up question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to offer a specific assessment from here. \xc2\xa0I think our intelligence officials could give you a better sense of how significant that risk would be. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve made quite clear that in terms of the refugee resettlement process that the administration -- or that this country has long followed, it includes thorough vetting of the background of these individuals to ensure that the safety and security of the American people is not put at undue risk by the resettlement of these refugees.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0May I follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Significant sort of coming off the same topic. \xc2\xa0There is some thought in Europe that the EU, the European Union, because of what we talk about, the basic premise of their existence is open borders and open trade where people can go freely through one country to another. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s concern that that basic premise will no longer hold and that the EU, in fact, its very existence, could be in jeopardy, which could cause enormous ramifications for the U.S., including trade.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, JC, I\xe2\x80\x99ve merely observed that the scale of this challenge in terms of the hundreds of thousands of people that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is not something that can be solved by just one country in Europe; that we\xe2\x80\x99re -- in order to successfully confront this challenge, the nations of Europe will have to do what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past, which is to effectively cooperate in terms of implementing policies to ensure that they can deal with this difficult challenge. \xc2\xa0Hopefully they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie, I saw your hand up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just wanted to go back to Cuba for a moment. \xc2\xa0It seems like a lot of the regulations that have been announced today will only have their desired effect if Cuba actually takes a corresponding action to reform its economy and, in fact, Secretary Pritzker said today that economic reforms there are overdue. \xc2\xa0So I wonder if the administration is going to take the opportunity of issuing these new rules to call on Cuba to do that now. \xc2\xa0Given that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that engagement is more effective than isolation, are you going to use that leverage here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the -- I can answer that in a couple of ways. \xc2\xa0First of all, it sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Secretary of Commerce did, and she should do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is that it is now clear that the Cuban government and the Cuban people now have an incentive that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have before to start implementing those reforms so that they can take advantage of the opportunity that the United States has extended to them. \xc2\xa0Now, this is not an opportunity that comes at the expense of the American people; it\xe2\x80\x99s actually an opportunity that the American people can benefit from as well. \xc2\xa0And so the United States government, through a variety of officials, including the Secretary of Commerce, will continue to press the Cuban government to implement the kinds of reforms that we believe are long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s your assessment now of what the prospects are for Congress actually lifting the embargo, which would obviously go a lot farther than these rules today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a whole lot of evidence to indicate that those prospects have significantly improved. \xc2\xa0We continue to believe that Congress should lift the embargo, but there are a range of policy changes that, short of lifting the embargo, that the administration can pursue that would make progress in normalizing relations between our two countries, enhancing engagement between our two governments and between the people of the United States and Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me do a week ahead, and then I will let you get started on your weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President, the First Lady, the Vice President, and Dr. Biden will greet His Holiness Pope Frances upon his arrival at Joint Base Andrews here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President and the First Lady will welcome Pope Francis to the White House. \xc2\xa0During the visit, the President and the Pope will continue the dialogue which they began during the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the Vatican in March, 2014, on their shared values and commitments on a wide range of issues. \xc2\xa0These issues include caring for the marginalized and the poor, advancing economic opportunity for all, serving as good stewards of the environment, protecting religious minorities and promoting religious freedom around the world, and welcoming and integrating immigrants and refugees into our communities. \xc2\xa0The President looks forward to continuing his conversation with the Holy Father during his first visit to the United States as Pope.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will host a private dinner for Xi Jinping, the President of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republican of China.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, the President and the First Lady will welcome President Xi and Madam Peng to the White House for an official state visit. \xc2\xa0This reciprocates President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s state visit to China in November, 2014. \xc2\xa0President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement constructively.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the end of that long week, the President will take Saturday off but then on Sunday, the President will travel to New York City to begin participating in the United Nations General Assembly. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about his schedule on Sunday and that next week at some point in the next few days.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Press conference with Xi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is the plan, yes. \xc2\xa0There is a plan for a news conference here at the White House with President Xi. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details about timing and format.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Friday, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, on Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\tHave a good weekend, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:16 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
