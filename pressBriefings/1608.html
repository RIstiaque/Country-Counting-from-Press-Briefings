Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  1:54 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I know you\'ve probably got a lot of questions today.\xc2\xa0 I want to start, though, by bringing you up to date on some information.\xc2\xa0 I just sent most of you all an email on this.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve learned that an individual who traveled to Mexico City to support the U.S. delegation that accompanied the President to Mexico City came down with flu-like symptoms associated with his work in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Three members of the individual\'s family tested positive for Type A influenza, and tests are currently underway to determine if they contracted the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain.\xc2\xa0 Individual family members suffered mild to moderate symptoms, received no medication, were not hospitalized, and have recovered.<br/> <br/>  I want to give you a quick timeline on some of this information and then after that we\'ll have plenty of time for questions.\xc2\xa0 This individual was the lead advance for the security detail of Energy Secretary Chu.\xc2\xa0 The individual traveled to Mexico in advance of Secretary Chu\'s visit, arriving there on April 13th.\xc2\xa0 He began to feel ill on April 16th, developed a fever on the 17th.\xc2\xa0 He returned to the United States on April 18th.<br/> <br/>  The following day he visited his brother\'s home, where he likely spread the virus to his nephew.\xc2\xa0 On the following two days, April 20th and 21st, the individual went to work at the Department of Energy.\xc2\xa0 A co-worker that rode in a car with him developed flu-like symptoms, but subsequent test results are negative.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the 20th and 21st, the individual\'s wife and young son developed flu-like symptoms.\xc2\xa0 On the 24th, the individual visited his family physician and related his travel history.\xc2\xa0 The doctor did not prescribe antiviral drugs, did not perform tests on the patient.<br/> <br/>  The following day, April 25th, the individual and his wife and son visited an urgent care facility, where they were administered rapid flu testing, and tested negative.\xc2\xa0 The individual followed up with the Anne Arundel County health authorities, and on April 28th the individual\'s wife, son, and nephew tested probable for H1N1.\xc2\xa0 They had tested positive, as I said, for influenza A; the subtype is unidentifiable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s where the letters and numbers H1N1 come into effect.<br/> <br/>  Further testing is being done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the nature of the outcome.\xc2\xa0 The original patient tested negative likely because so much time had elapsed since the onset of his own symptoms that they would not show up in the test.\xc2\xa0 As I said, all four individuals experienced only mild symptoms and all four have recovered.\xc2\xa0 This person has been cleared to go back to work by doctors and is back working today.<br/> <br/>  That\'s a short tick-tock.\xc2\xa0 I know you probably have other questions, and I\'ll be happy to answer as many of those as I can.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I assume that the reason you disclosed this is because doctors and officials think that this probably is a case of the swine flu virus?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we felt the need to disclose the probability of this.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve heard the President discuss over the course of the last few days whether there are confirmed or suspected cases and we thought it was important to disclose that information -- again, understanding that the individuals that were involved have recovered and are fine.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the questions -- well, I asked about quarantine and obviously that\'s a more controversial, difficult decision to make -- maybe comes later in this outbreak process, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m just wondering what the discussion is like here about when you might use that kind of -- when you might take that kind of step.\xc2\xa0 The President seemed to suggest that right now the responsibility is mostly on individual people to essentially quarantine themselves.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, as you know, the President is receiving regular updates on this information.\xc2\xa0 Let me add a few things to the timeline that I should have.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu has not and did not experience any symptoms.\xc2\xa0 Because he is asymptomatic, he has not been tested and there are no plans to do so.\xc2\xa0 The same is true -- the President, as I\'ve said here many times, has not experienced any symptoms and doctors see no need to conduct any tests.<br/> <br/>  In terms of -- I want to put it in a broad brush of other steps that might be taken.\xc2\xa0 Obviously events change quickly and the President and the team at CDC, HHS, DHS, Homeland Security here, are monitoring the situation.\xc2\xa0 And I think as the President said, we will take any step or precaution necessary to ensure the safety of the American people.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, considering that one member of the advance team has turned up to -- you know, has developed symptoms and been infected, isn\'t there any further actions being taken to look at the entire group that went and -- to make sure that the President is completely --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let\'s understand that we are now almost twice the limit removed from a symptomatic window that one would see for incubation.\xc2\xa0 So anybody that went on the trip, anybody that went in support of the trip, it is highly, highly, highly unlikely that -- I think we\'re now 13 -- yes, 13 days ago this morning the team left Mexico -- again, in excess of almost twice the limit on the window.\xc2\xa0 If you haven\'t felt any symptoms, there\'s no need to test you.<br/> <br/>  Again, if you -- the same advice that others have given to the general public remain very much in accord with what we would tell anybody here and what we would tell staff, which is, you know, if you feel sick, stay home; go see a doctor; take precautions.\xc2\xa0 But if you\'re asymptomatic, there\'s no reason to believe that there\'s anything other than the fact that you don\'t have it.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question and a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any idea how this individual may have contracted --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s -- again, without knowing the precise time at which he began to feel ill on the 16th -- we didn\'t land until the afternoon of the 16th, it\'s -- based on the fact that there\'s an incubation period, you know, it\'s likely he began to get sick before -- days before the team landed on the day of the visit.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my other question has to do with remarks that Vice President Biden made this morning on television.\xc2\xa0 Representatives of the travel industry have accused the Vice President of coming close to fear-mongering because of his comments, and I\'m wondering if you wanted to clarify or correct or apologize for the remarks that he made.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the -- what the Vice President meant to say was the same thing that, again, many members have said in the last few days, and that is, if you feel sick, if you are exhibiting symptoms, flu-like symptoms -- coughing, sneezing, runny nose -- that you should take precautions, that you should limit your travel.\xc2\xa0 And I think he just -- what he said and what he meant to say.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With all due respect, and I sympathize with you trying to explain the Vice President\'s comments, but that\'s not even remotely close to what he said.\xc2\xa0 He was asked about --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if a member of his family were going to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I understand what he said and I\'m telling you what he meant to say -- (laughter) -- which was that if somebody is experiencing symptoms -- and you heard the President say this last night -- if somebody is feeling sick, if somebody is exhibiting symptoms of being sick, then they should take all necessary precaution.\xc2\xa0 Obviously if anybody was unduly alarmed for whatever reason, we would apologize for that and I hope that my remarks and remarks of the people of the CDC and Secretary Napolitano have appropriately cleared up what he meant to say.<br/> <br/>  Ed.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Chrysler, the President seemed very confident that they were going to emerge from bankruptcy, be healthier, more viable.\xc2\xa0 Where does he get that confidence when immediately industry analysts are saying it\'s going to be very hard to find a bankruptcy judge to deal with some of this and --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The case has already been assigned to a bankruptcy judge.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, find a -- not just find one, but find one that\'s willing to take some steps with the bond holders, for example, that will make -- you know, there\'s all kinds of details here that have not been fleshed out.\xc2\xa0 And so how does he have confidence in that, number one.\xc2\xa0 And number two --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer the first one --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Americans have not been buying Chrysler vehicles for a long time.\xc2\xa0 So how do they turn around all of a sudden?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s not generalize.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously I\'ve mentioned in here that you have -- you\'ve had a dip in the number of autos purchased.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure you\'ve had a dip in the number of VCRs purchased, or DVDs -- I\'m showing my age, aren\'t I?\xc2\xa0 We still have those videos that my son watches on occasion.<br/> <br/>  You know, we\'re seeing a general economic recession where the demand for virtually every good is down.\xc2\xa0 So people aren\'t buying --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Chrysler has not been selling a lot of cars for years.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not just the last six months.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Neither is Ford or Toyota or GM or any number.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I\'m not up here to go through the monthly sales figures of the auto industry; we all know those.\xc2\xa0 But I think I would push back on some of the reporting that I\'ve heard and some of the characterizations relating to this deal.\xc2\xa0 You have 80 percent of the United Auto Workers who took some significant sacrifices to ratify this deal.\xc2\xa0 You have the major debt holders of the company who have signed off on parts of this agreement.\xc2\xa0 You had the former owner relinquish its stake in this company.<br/> <br/>  So I think the reason the President expressed hope last night was the notion that we had made great progress with a vast majority of the stakeholders that he talked about regularly as a part of this process.\xc2\xa0 As the President mentioned, there are people that decided they would take -- decided they wanted to take less of a sacrifice than other debt holders, than the workers, than former owners.\xc2\xa0 They tried to, in a sense, play chicken with the government for a better deal and nobody blinked.<br/> <br/>  So that\'s why the need remains for a quick, structured bankruptcy that the President is optimistic about and believes will put Chrysler on a path toward viability that does not need continued assistance from the federal government in order to do well.<br/> <br/>  But your broader point, Ed, is, again, the demand for virtually everything is down because of an economic recession.\xc2\xa0 We did see some positive consumer spending numbers within the numbers that were released I guess yesterday on quarterly GDP numbers.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has taken steps to get the economy back on a road to recovery where we think we\'ll see increased auto sales and increased consumer spending on a number of things.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you walk us through the President\'s involvement and role in making the decision on the Chrysler bankruptcy, where he was, and when he made the decision -- any tick-tock you can give us on that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I don\'t have a ton of tick-tick on it.\xc2\xa0 I know the President was -- look, the task force has been working for the last -- well, for the last month, and particularly in the last several days I think there have been announcements that there were agreements between the auto company and the union, agreements between the auto company and major debt holders, that have shown steady progress.\xc2\xa0 The President got -- continually got updates as part of his economic daily briefing, as well as other meetings to bring him up to speed on where the restructuring plan was.\xc2\xa0 And he got several updates throughout yesterday and today.\xc2\xa0 And I think he said -- as he said last night, was hopeful, and I think that information was based on briefing that he got throughout the day and they were moving in the right direction.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When exactly did he make the decision and where was he, what were the circumstances, do you know?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact time in which any decision might have been made.\xc2\xa0 I can see if there\'s some clarity on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there was a moment --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything we can get on that.\xc2\xa0 And also, he did sound a little peeved at these people who, as you said, were playing chicken with the government.\xc2\xa0 How peeved was he?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you saw it in what he said.\xc2\xa0 And what he said throughout this process is that those involved in, stakeholders involved in this negotiation were going to have to understand for the greater good of seeing Chrysler go forward that we were all going to have to make some sacrifices.\xc2\xa0 Workers made sacrifices, ownership made sacrifices, a majority of the debt holders made sacrifices, and some decided they wanted to get a better deal.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'d reiterate that I guess they thought somebody was going to blink and it didn\'t happen.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to tie up one quick loose end.\xc2\xa0 Did the President interact at all with this individual who had the swine flu?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President -- this individual was -- this individual never flew on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 The individual would have been at the working dinner on the night of -- I said Thursday, Friday -- Thursday night the 16th.\xc2\xa0 He was asked specifically if he ever came within six feet of the President and the answer to that was no.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but he did interact with Secretary Chu, presumably?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and like I said, was at that dinner, but not close enough to the President.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And here\'s my real question.\xc2\xa0 Back to the bankruptcy thing.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That can count as a real one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want it to go on the tally, though.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s all right.\xc2\xa0 As you can see from last night, we didn\'t keep a good tally.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 It seems like a lot of the bankruptcy deals premise on this notion of a 30- to 60-day bankruptcy and I guess my question is, given the obstinance you\'ve described of these creditors, what gives you any assurance that this can be done in 30 to 60 days?\xc2\xa0 Those creditors will walk into bankruptcy courts, they\'ll have rights, they\'ll have an opportunity to litigate, market test that Fiat deal, say that liquidation would be more beneficial.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this could stretch out months.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When you mean beneficial, beneficial to whom?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, to the creditors.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s part of bankruptcy law that if you can get more in liquidation, the judge can\'t rubber-stamp another deal.\xc2\xa0 So I guess what I\'m saying is, why do you think it\'s going to be quick?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because we feel confident that a majority of the stakeholders, a vast majority of the stakeholders are onboard with a deal that we think is in the interests of all of those involved.\xc2\xa0 And we think we can convince -- that a judge can be convinced of that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it goes on beyond the 30 to 60 days, is that financing enough?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s not get 61 days into the equation, and we\'ll have any number of opportunities to do that as we get closer.\xc2\xa0 Again, we feel confident that the structure of the agreement, the sacrifices that have been made by the vast majority of those involved in the operations of Chrysler, give this deal an excellent chance of working.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President trying to influence the bankruptcy judge in terms of vis-\xc3\xa0-vis how those creditors are treated?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume judges make opinions based on what\'s their reading of the law and not based on what any individual said.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, do they think the judge can be convinced and the President --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously -- I mean, I think it\'s safe to assume that we will present a case and render an opinion as to why we think the deal is workable, why we\'re confident that a majority of the stakeholders involved are onboard, and why we think it\'s in the best interests of all those involved.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick, did the President talk to the Vice President about his statements on the Today show?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would you characterize his reaction?\xc2\xa0 Because he\'s been so careful about calibrating the --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\'t -- I don\'t think they talked, so it\'d be hard to characterize the conversation.<br/> <br/>  Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick clarification on the security detail.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday there were reports from public health service -- public health officials in Maryland that there was a case in Anne Arundel.\xc2\xa0 Was that referring to this or are you giving us a new case?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Without providing names, that\'s the case I\'m talking about.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And you said that if anyone was unduly alarmed by what the Vice President was saying we would apologize for that.\xc2\xa0 Is that an apology -- are you apologizing for it?\xc2\xa0 And is there any thought about the Vice President perhaps apologizing?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- I think the Vice President put out -- office of the Vice President put out a statement.\xc2\xa0 I\'m apologizing to those that were unduly alarmed, in case people saw it and weren\'t alarmed and wouldn\'t necessarily denote wanting an apology from me.<br/> <br/>  Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify your responses to Chip\'s question.\xc2\xa0 Did the President actually have to sign off on every facet of this Chrysler deal?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- well, it\'s the President\'s Auto Task Force.\xc2\xa0 It\'s --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I thought maybe perhaps the Treasury Secretary -- but the Fiat part, the bankruptcy part, the GMAC --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\'s the -- obviously the Secretary -- the Auto Task Force is largely housed in the Department of Treasury. He would have I guess line authority on all this.\xc2\xa0 But obviously -- the President, I think you saw from his comments, thinks the agreement is a good agreement.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess to follow up on his follow-up -- (laughter) -- did the President just rubber-stamp a decision that was made at the Treasury Department, or was he presented the facts and then -- loaded question, I know --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s just funny.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but did he come in and get a presentation of the facts and say, here is what I\'m going to do?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been involved throughout this process for many, many months, involved in the determinations of the original plans, how to structure the next steps in terms of 30- and 60-day deadlines; has spent quite a bit of time in the intervening 30 days listening to aspects of the deal, and I can assure everybody that if the President didn\'t agree with this, I doubt he would have gone out there and said what he said today.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees with this deal.\xc2\xa0 The President thought the agreement was a good one and in the best interest of all those involved.<br/> <br/>  And I\'ll say this -- I don\'t think this was a done deal 30 days ago.\xc2\xa0 I think the Auto Task Force team deserves a ton of credit in bringing two would-be partners together, working individually and collectively with all of those stakeholders and doing something that many people might not have thought was going to happen.\xc2\xa0 I forget the exact percentage that people put on this happening in a meeting that we had a little over a month ago, but as somebody said, these type of things rarely get better as time goes on, meaning the chances for them happening.\xc2\xa0 I think they deserve a tremendous amount of credit for working with all of those involved, and I think people that were involved and took sacrifices in order for a company to move forward in a viable way deserve a lot of credit, as well.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who said that -- "these things rarely get better as time goes on"?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One of the members of the team that advises the President.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a two-fer as well, but back to the individual on the security detail.\xc2\xa0 Did he fly back commercially or --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And who did he fly -- who was the carrier, and what was the route?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was a United flight to Dulles.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Have they notified the passengers who were on the same --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a question we were checking on when I came back out here; I don\'t know the answer to it.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know the flight number, do you have that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not information I\'ve been given.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second, I\'ll come back --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wants to follow up on H1N1 --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, do you want to follow?\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you just said that the Mexican government has been so transparent with information.\xc2\xa0 But is there second-guessing that probably they knew something that they didn\'t tell you?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information related to that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve made representations and I think we\'ve released statements on information based on what we\'ve gotten from the Mexican government.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m reclaiming my time. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Paul Volcker --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The gentleman from Washington.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seattle.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, Seattle.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Paul Volcker said yesterday that he didn\'t think a second stimulus would be necessary.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that, given where unemployment is at?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not spoken to the President recently on second stimulus.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously we\'re in the process of working to get the first money out the door as quickly as possible, to do it in a way that\'s transparent but gets the money out to the projects that need it the most quickly.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll have a better chance of evaluating where we are in the economy, but there\'s no plan currently for a second stimulus.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if Volcker has communicated that to the President as chairman of the Recovery Board?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he communicated that with the President or not.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\'m wondering if you can help me understand why the President is mad at the hedge funds.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe they are doing something that they don\'t have a right to do in this negotiated process with the future of Chrysler, and that they might feel that 29 cents on the dollar isn\'t such a good deal for them, and they would be within their rights to pursue their interests in the bankruptcy court?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure the President\'s problem with them is based on their rights.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s problem with them is based on the notion that, as he said and as many members of the team have said, and as many members involved in this agreement have done, which is make sacrifices in order for the company to move forward.<br/> <br/>  There are those that decided that those steps could be taken, and there were those that decided they would -- given your ratios -- ask for more than twice that amount.\xc2\xa0 I think the sacrifices that have been made by all those involved haven\'t been made by all.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President made the comments that he did.\xc2\xa0 But again, I\'d reiterate the President believes this is a good agreement.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you said that nobody blinked, it might sound to some that the outcome the administration would most prefer from the bankruptcy proceeding is to give those who thought somebody might blink punishment -- less than they were seeking.\xc2\xa0 Was that the outcome that you would like to see and should anyone looking --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to prejudge the outcome except to say that there were offers on the table that we thought and others thought were fair and I think they had every ability and right to take them.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Ed\'s question.\xc2\xa0 I know the President doesn\'t want to be in the automotive business and everyone can understand why.\xc2\xa0 But there was a previous merger with Chrysler and a very well known world-dominating brand, Daimler -- that didn\'t work out for all sorts of reasons -- clash of cultures, design, engineering, things didn\'t match up.\xc2\xa0 Why is it that a brand name that has less clout within Europe and the U.S. market, Fiat, is going to work when Daimler-Chrysler didn\'t?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, they have expertise in restructuring that we think and that others think make this a viable partnership.\xc2\xa0 And secondly, their expertise and know-how in the creation and the manufacturing of more fuel-efficient engines, which -- to build off of Ed\'s question on car sales -- I don\'t think it\'s altogether surprising that Hummer is not a dealer -- a brand name that\'s likely going to survive this economic downturn.\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t necessarily do so well during $4.50 a gallon gas either.<br/> <br/>  The President talked about in his remarks and has said on any number of occasions over the years that what we have to do is we have to have American auto companies that are building cars that American consumers have a demand for and want to buy.\xc2\xa0 And I think the example with Fiat provides expertise in that area.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a manufacturing move to put those cars on the market in the hopes that they will purchased?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a manufacturing move -- I mean, Fiat gets more percentage of the company if it meets some thresholds.\xc2\xa0 One of them is introducing this fuel-efficient technology.\xc2\xa0 The second is introducing a 40-mile-per-gallon vehicle.\xc2\xa0 It might look to some as if the government is not just suggesting, but creating equity for Fiat by producing a certain kind of vehicle for a market.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Two responses.\xc2\xa0 One, I think the President was pretty clear that Fiat can\'t take a majority ownership in a merged company unless or until American taxpayers have been paid back in whole.\xc2\xa0 Two, regardless of why, the President and I think a vast majority of the public believes that more fuel-efficient automobiles are in the best interest of this country.\xc2\xa0 Whether it lessens the demand for oil and gas and makes us less dependent on foreign oil, whether they emit less harmful pollutants, I think that many involved both at a government and a private sector level see the strong desire for more energy-efficient automobiles.<br/> <br/>  Lester.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 What appeared to be --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I just interrupt and -- you have fit right into the second row by starting with two questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) I just -- go ahead.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it was a vacant seat.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I notice if you sit in the fourth row, you tend to probably only ask like one question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What appeared to be 90 reporters attended last night\'s presidential press conference, but only 13 of the 90 were allowed to ask questions, which the President took 45 minutes and 24 seconds to answer.\xc2\xa0 And my question --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I correct the premise of your question?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, of course.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a full transcript in front of me, but I think on a number of those occasions multiple questions were asked.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thirteen people asked questions.\xc2\xa0 Thirteen people asked an unnumbered --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s right, 13 out of 90.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The same question was asked twice.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you and the President believe that television networks will continue covering these 13 only selected questioners in advance presidential speeches, or do you think they may join FOX in refusing?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have enough trouble speaking for this government without getting into trouble speaking for a network.\xc2\xa0 I think I would ask those individual networks.\xc2\xa0 I think your question mischaracterizes what happened last night.\xc2\xa0 I think, Lester, you saw, if I\'m not mistaken, the President answer questions about the flu, which you all have asked today; the President was asked about Notre Dame, Lester, as you have asked about --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he didn\'t take one -- he did not even mention Notre Dame, did he, in his answer -- a very good question.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know -- I want to give Ed credit for asking a good question, one in which you built on in this very room.<br/> <br/>  The President was asked about Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 The President was asked about Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President was asked about the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President was asked about a lot of those -- the President was asked about the Republican Congress -- many of the same questions that I get and many of the same interests that you all have.\xc2\xa0 I think the President addressed many of the cares and concerns on behalf of the American people and was glad to do so.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights president, William Donahue, noted, in the House Judiciary Committee, an amendment to H.R. 1913, the Hate Crimes Bill, which amendment would have excluded pedophilia, was voted down 13 to 10, while another amendment to bar prosecution based on religious beliefs was also defeated 11 to 8.\xc2\xa0 And my question:\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe pedophilia should be a legally protected sexual orientation, and that religious beliefs opposing homosexuality are not protected under our Constitution\'s freedom of religion?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not familiar with the amendments, Lester.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you get back to us on that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when did the President himself become aware of this -- the incident of the lead advance person for Secretary Chu becoming infected?\xc2\xa0 And what other advance people, from which other agencies and departments were traveling with Secretary Chu? Obviously Secretary Clinton -- or Secretary Clinton was on the trip, and others.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The initial -- let me describe a little bit about how the initial information came into the White House.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Dr. Kuhlman, who works in the White House Medical Office, was talking with Dr. Besser from the CDC.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Kuhlman was -- developed the pandemic flu plan for the White House several years ago, as many states did, around the avian flu.\xc2\xa0 They were discussing in general the flu virus.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Besser asked Dr. Kuhlman if there was anything he could do.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Kuhlman said, can you keep me up to date on cases in the capital area.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Besser said, we\'re following some probable cases in Maryland that might include a Department of Energy official.<br/> <br/>  Dr. Kuhlman called the Department of Energy and then ultimately called this advance -- lead advance security detail individual.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve spent the last many hours sort of piecing a lot of this stuff together and informing those that were on the trip.\xc2\xa0 Those calls began mid-to-late afternoon yesterday.<br/> <br/>  I talked specifically with the President about the information this morning.\xc2\xa0 I would have to go back and look at notes in terms of what, if anything, before that -- I know we discussed -- I discussed with him the nature of our release of the information.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who from other agencies?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will go back and see what other information -- what other agencies sent people on the trip.\xc2\xa0 In talking with the doctor this morning, he said that -- I\'ll be a little careful with this, and you\'ll see why in a minute -- there were general warnings that were given out that we might experience gastrointestinal difficulties, so people that came back from the trip that were experiencing any kind of illness can go see the doctor.\xc2\xa0 He believes that approximately 10 people came to see him that may have experienced something approximating a flu-like symptom.\xc2\xa0 None of those people, though, came back with any positive test.<br/> <br/>  So nobody else that we know of is experiencing symptoms or has gotten sick.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me come back to the bankruptcy filing.\xc2\xa0 I thought the President had said repeatedly that he was not going to put billions of taxpayer dollars into a company if all the stakeholders didn\'t come to the table.\xc2\xa0 But all the stakeholders have not come to the table.\xc2\xa0 There\'s still a holdout group.\xc2\xa0 Yet we still have -- we have now $3.3 billion of taxpayer money that\'s going to cover Chrysler during the bankruptcy period.\xc2\xa0 Hasn\'t he changed his mind here?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, Mark, he\'s come to the determination that this is an agreement that helps get Chrysler back on a path towards viability and one that has done so without continued government assistance.\xc2\xa0 I think if you go back and look at the President\'s remarks about 30 days ago, you\'ll see that the President discussed in those remarks that we would do everything in our power to deal with individual stakeholders, but that bankruptcy might still be an option, it might still be a possibility.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the point at which we find ourselves today.<br/> <br/>  Would we like to have announced an agreement with a hundred percent of those stakeholders rather than some vast, vast majority?\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that we have a good agreement.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that $3.3 billion at risk in the bankruptcy filing, the additional money -- the additional money that\'s going into Chrysler?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, you mean --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if the company is ultimately liquidated, if the bankruptcy judge throws everything out.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t entertain hypotheticals any more than I did for Savannah, so we\'ll wait on that.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any thoughts on the fact that British troops are formally being withdrawn as of today, Robert, and that the partnership now that PM Brown has expressed is between himself and the -- the British and the Iraqi government, as well -- equal partnership?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no specific reaction.\xc2\xa0 I know that maybe -- (loud cheering) -- apparently there\'s a reaction just outside the building.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Wow, I don\'t know what\'s going on out there -- oh, it\'s the bike thing -- that\'s right.\xc2\xa0 I was like, wow, what\'s going on out there?\xc2\xa0 It\'s the Wounded Warriors bike event.<br/> <br/>  I mean, I think the President addressed Iraq last night and the concerns that we continue to have despite the fact that even with what we\'ve seen in the newspapers recently there is -- we\'re still at vastly less violence than we\'ve seen earlier in this process.\xc2\xa0 We\'re pleased that Chris Hill is in Iraq and look forward to continued and sustained political progress and keeping of the time table that the President and the Joint Chiefs outlined.<br/> <br/>  Christina.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you talk a little bit about the incubation period for the swine flu?\xc2\xa0 How confident is the government that that\'s going to remain the same?\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President is out there asking people to go to the doctor if they feel sick.\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts on that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would encourage you to ask the same question of doctors at CDC, but that information comes from them and my sense is they don\'t have any scientific evidence to believe it\'s different than that.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think it\'s important to understand that this individual -- when he began to feel ill and now or I guess -- what\'s the date, the 28th -- as I said, he is listed as suspected of having subtype H1N1, but because the virus has run its course and he\'s recovered and now back to work, it doesn\'t show up on the test.\xc2\xa0 So I think that gives you a sense that the incubation period is a fixed number.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will you guys be alerting the passengers on that flight, that United flight?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- one of the things that was left sort of undone when I came out was figuring out the -- I don\'t know legally what procedure all of that -- all of it encompasses, but obviously we\'ll do everything in our power to ensure that what can be done to alert them will be done.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, this White House doesn\'t get off the message very often.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How was it that the Vice President\'s message veered off so radically this morning?\xc2\xa0 Does he get briefed before he goes on television to talk about -- (laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you brief him?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not talk to him this morning, no.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what happened?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he said something on TV differently than what he meant to say.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on that, did you -- did the White House Press Office consult on the statement that came out from the Vice President\'s Office about that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We saw the statement before it was put out.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not highly unusual.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President\'s Office recognized the need to put out a statement quickly and ensure that people had all of the relevant information that they needed.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it misrepresented what the Vice President said?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President misrepresented what the Vice President wanted to say, and what he meant to say was what others have said recently.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President said last night with respect to the enhanced interrogation techniques that we could have gotten this information in other ways.\xc2\xa0 How does he know that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Without getting specific, I think that\'s in any number of intelligence reports.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meaning that -- I mean, if they got the information one way -- and they got it that way -- how can you know that you would have gotten it a different way?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d -- because of the information, I\'m not going to get into some of it.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just a question that was asked last night and not exactly answered, if he did have a high-value -- if the United States had a high-value al Qaeda suspect and they needed that information, would he rule out using different techniques for --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into hypotheticals like you did.<br/> <br/>  Steve.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President last night talked about the Recovery Act so far has -- already has created or saved 150,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 Yet the net job loss is over a million in that time frame.\xc2\xa0 How do you get to the 150,000, and does it suggest that it\'s possible that at the end of this you could have reached your goal and the country could still have a net job loss?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I will get you the paper that was created by the Council of Economic Advisers on the statistics being compiled.\xc2\xa0 The note says -- well, the figure denotes that unemployment would be that much higher had the 150,000 jobs saved or created not been done so during the time period in which those employment figures were released.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how -- first of all, how do you get -- come up with 150,000?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll get you the -- you have to carry numbers and I\'ll get the CEA to --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That comes from CEA?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it is possible -- you could save 3.5 million jobs at the end of this period and we could end up with 8 million more jobs lost?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not an economist.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t prepare the Department of Labor\'s employment statistics on a monthly basis.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s hard for me -- and I wouldn\'t predict job loss in the months going forward except to say I think it will be quite some time before we see months where we don\'t have extensive job loss.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said that on many occasions.<br/> <br/>  I think some of the statistics and information that we gave out during this debate denoted that the President -- the President and his team made estimations, for instance, on both employment and in demand growth of what would happen with and what would happen without a recovery and reinvestment plan.\xc2\xa0 And we have always said that the downturn in job loss and the downturn in retracted growth and lessening demand would be far more extensive without the recovery and reinvestment plan than -- would be greater without it than if we had passed it, and which we did.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is his figure based on a formula then or is it company by company?\xc2\xa0 Did they go in and say, well, Caterpillar saved 1,000 jobs --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- we\'ll put out some paper to give you a sense of --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow on that just more generally.\xc2\xa0 So the 3.5 million saved or created, that\'s only within the confines of the economic recovery package -- that\'s a closed system?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s the way we\'ve talked about the bill, yes.<br/> <br/>  Kirk.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 A couple of Presidents of UAW locals have supported the President, but they say they have been called upon, their workers have been called upon to make multiple sacrifices --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And they have.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- whereas Wall Street executives who drove the economy in the ditch have not been called upon to make similar sacrifices, in their view.\xc2\xa0 They say there\'s a double-standard.\xc2\xa0 Are they right?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think you can point to companies that predate our administration that have seen their leadership and the composition of their boards change.\xc2\xa0 I can probably pull you quotes from banks that haven\'t necessarily thought some of what has been done some of their leadership thought was altogether helpful.<br/> <br/>  But I think, as the President said last night, we -- he\'s anxious to envision a time in which the government is not part of the banking system, not part of the auto system, not part of any insurance company -- but ensuring adequate rules of the road that give the American people confidence that what we\'ve seen happen over the last six to nine months -- or, actually, going back quite further than that -- doesn\'t happen again.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a clarification of what you said about the President and Senator Specter.\xc2\xa0 As I understood it -- and correct me if I\'m wrong; I know you will -- (laughter) --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Fret not.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President only learned of Senator Specter\'s decision on Tuesday morning, but Vice President Biden had been having multiple conversations with him.\xc2\xa0 Had the Vice President kept the President in the loop or what?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether they had specific conversations about that or not.<br/> <br/>  April.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the swine flu issue, as you prepare for possibilities of a pandemic, you know, there\'s expected to be a hard-hitting impact on insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 Is this White House working with the insurance companies to possibly continue to fund, you know, the medicines and supplies and even some sick days off, because we know some of the insurers are having problems right now financially?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked with the economic team about whether -- about their evaluation of insurance companies in this time period.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has talked about -- you heard the President talk about, yesterday before going to Missouri, having families make plans for schools that might close.\xc2\xa0 But I will go and see if there\'s any specific planning that\'s being done as it relates to insurance companies.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about liability protection for the manufacturers of a vaccine, should one be developed?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\'re working on, as I mentioned a couple of days ago, working on a seed stock for the development of that vaccine.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, the questions that we just asked, you\'ll get back?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  2:43 P.M. EDT</div> </div></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
