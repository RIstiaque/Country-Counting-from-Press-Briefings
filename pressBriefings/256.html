EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Los Angeles. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements at the top, so I am happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the remarks the President made at the White House, he seemed to be advocating for gun control while saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s politically impossible right now. \xc2\xa0Is that an accurate interpretation? \xc2\xa0And is there any talk at the White House about trying to revive gun control legislation, or do you guys just consider that the advocates for gun rights are too powerful to overcome right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Nedra, as you pointed out, before we left the White House, the President did have a chance to speak about the tragic shooting in South Carolina last evening. \xc2\xa0The President gave a very powerful presentation. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have much to add to that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say the President is very clear -- has been very clear on his position on this issue. \xc2\xa0And if you go back to 2013, when the President worked very hard to exhaust every possible avenue to tackle this issue -- in fact, we completed 23 executive actions. \xc2\xa0We didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave anything in the cupboard on steps that we could take to address this. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President was also very clear that the biggest, boldest action would have to be taken by Congress. \xc2\xa0That is an effort that we devoted significant resources to. \xc2\xa0The President himself spoke on it. \xc2\xa0We commenced a significant lobbying campaign to Congress, and we fell short. \xc2\xa0Congress fell short. \xc2\xa0Congress was not able to take this on. \xc2\xa0And the President was clear today in his remarks about the political realities that we do face in Congress and in Washington right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is anticipating Congress moving on this anytime soon. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re very realistic about the political realities. \xc2\xa0But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a moment for Americans to realize the urgency of this issue and acknowledge it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some reports that the President had made some phone calls to the community members. \xc2\xa0Can you give us a list of who those might be and what kind of message he sent, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s any plans yet for the President to visit Charleston?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0David, the President, this morning, did have a chance to telephone Charleston Mayor Riley. \xc2\xa0He also spoke with South Carolina House Minority Leader J. Todd Rutherford, who I also believe is very close with the church, and Representative Clyburn.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Vice President, this morning, had a chance to call Mayor Riley as well. \xc2\xa0He also spoke with Reverend Joe Darby and Bishop Richard Franklin Norris. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel plans to announce, but obviously the President will be following the situation closely. \xc2\xa0As I think you also heard, the Attorney General this morning announced that she will be opening a federal hate crimes investigation. \xc2\xa0So as those details unfold, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be paying close attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When was the President made aware of the shooting yesterday? \xc2\xa0And he talked about having a relationship with some of the members of the church. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us who those are, and specifically what his relationship was with the pastor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kristen, can you repeat the first question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When was he briefed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0He was made aware of this last night. \xc2\xa0And in terms of his relationship with some of the folks that he mentioned, I know that the Reverend there was an early supporter of the President. \xc2\xa0Their relationship with the First Lady -- his relationship with the First Lady and the President date back to 2007. \xc2\xa0They were early supporters of the President. \xc2\xa0They met and formed a bond back in 2007 when they were campaigning early on in the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort to get to the White House. \xc2\xa0And that bond was strong enough to endure all the way until today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, a number of presidential candidates, and also Debbie Wasserman Schultz, have cancelled fundraisers and political events today. \xc2\xa0Is there any discussion at the White House of doing the same out of respect for the tragedy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0No, Justin, I hadn\'t heard of any conversations about that. \xc2\xa0I will say, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, the President took some time to make calls earlier today. \xc2\xa0He did speak to you all about his reaction to the tragic shooting. \xc2\xa0He spoke powerfully. \xc2\xa0He spoke from the heart. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t know of any scheduling changes for the next few days. \xc2\xa0If we have any, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you about a couple of votes in Congress today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0You can ask me about anything you\xe2\x80\x99d like, Nedra.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, first of all, we had another TPA vote, and Nancy Pelosi said that -- is saying that she sees no path for TAA. \xc2\xa0So I wanted to get an update. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, when we asked Josh whether the President would veto TPA without TAA, he said that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to that. \xc2\xa0But it sounds like that\'s a distinct possibility. \xc2\xa0So would the President veto trade promotion authority alone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0The President has been clear that he wants both TPA and TAA at his desk for his signature as soon as possible. \xc2\xa0The only strategy that we support moving through Congress is one that includes both of those pieces getting to his desk for his signature.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President had good, constructive conversations last night in his session with House Democrats and with Senate Democrats. \xc2\xa0He was clear that the only way that this garners his support is if both of those pieces move to his desk.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President urge those Senate Democrats to vote for the TPA bill that passed the House today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0He urged the Senate Democrats to continue their support for TPA, like they showed a few weeks ago in their votes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry, can you just be more specific about that? \xc2\xa0I mean, does the President support the legislative strategy that\'s currently being pursued by the House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think, as you saw, Leader McConnell, Leader Boehner have both talked about the strategy. \xc2\xa0The President feels very strongly that any strategy that he supports would require both TAA and TPA to get to his desk. \xc2\xa0I know conversations are still going on about the sequencing of that. \xc2\xa0I know that the President remains engaged; so do senior White House officials and officials from the relevant agencies. \xc2\xa0And of course, senators and House members are going to have to talk amongst themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So this sounds like the strategy then isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite set out, like what the next step is from here to get to the end goal that you\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed where they both end up on his desk.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, Roberta, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we now have -- TPA *and TAA both passed the House and the Senate. \xc2\xa0TPA has passed the House a second time, now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- before we lifted off. \xc2\xa0So we feel confident that the procedural snafus that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all experienced over the past few weeks are in the process of getting untangled. \xc2\xa0And we have confidence that the House and Senate leadership are working through that in real time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that the President spoke or interacted with Leader Pelosi at the picnic yesterday and possibly with her granddaughter, as well. \xc2\xa0But I wondered if you could tell us any more about that interaction, whether they talked about this issue, whether they came to some sort of resolution between the two of them, or whether it was just more like informal chatter about other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0David, I don\'t know that a substantive conversation about trade occurred with Leader Pelosi at the picnic last night. \xc2\xa0I believe the more substantive conversations on trade happened in those sessions with the House Democrats who supported trade and the Senate Democrats who supported trade.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0She was not involved in those meetings?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0She was not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, what would you say about the state of the President\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with congressional Democrats? \xc2\xa0How frustrated is he with them about how this has been played?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think you\'re going to see over the next 48 hours data that will answer that question as the President goes out and makes sure that congressional Democrats have the resources they need for the upcoming elections to wage effective campaigns. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, as Josh has, that his relationship with Leader Pelosi goes back many, many years. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no one he has worked more closely with on Capitol Hill on his priorities. \xc2\xa0That dates back to the Recovery Act, the Affordable Care Act, Wall Street reform. \xc2\xa0And so the relationship there is strong enough to withstand a policy difference on any single issue, even one as important as this.</p>\n<p>\n\tI also think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on trade is one that\'s shared by Democrats across the country; that if you look at where Democrats stand on this issue, they understand that globalization is at our door. \xc2\xa0And we have two options. \xc2\xa0We can either put our head in the sand and let others, like China, write the rules. \xc2\xa0Or we can advantage American workers and American businesses and make sure that we\'re setting the rules. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why the President has instructed his negotiators to come up with the most progressive trade package that this country has ever seen. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s working to make sure we get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you expect it to be a little bit awkward as he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting Leader Pelosi on her turf?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think, again, the relationship that Leader Pelosi and the President have dates back many years. \xc2\xa0It is strong enough to withstand a difference on any particular issue. \xc2\xa0And I think that it\xe2\x80\x99ll be noteworthy that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on trade is one that is enjoyed by Democrats across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And let me just make sure I understand what you said earlier. \xc2\xa0Do TPA and TAA both have to be sitting on his desk when he signs TPA?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Again, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s conversations about the sequencing and what passes and what -- all of that stuff. \xc2\xa0So I\'m going to let those conversations continue. \xc2\xa0But if your question is, does the President want both at his desk, the answer to that is yes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So are you saying that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a decision made if only TPA passes whether he will veto it or not?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\'m telling you the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference and bright line here is to get both to his desk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So could the President sign TPA before TAA passes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Again, I would defer to our friends and colleagues in both the House and the Senate for how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to sequence this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are there lawmakers traveling with the President on this trip at all?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so. \xc2\xa0I think they\xe2\x80\x99re voting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are votes on defense spending that are supposed to happen about right now, I think. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting the Senate to pass the authorization bill and then Senate Democrats to block the appropriations bill. \xc2\xa0So does the President support that strategy? \xc2\xa0Or is it risky for Democrats to block defense spending appropriations at a time when Republicans are saying the world is on fire and the troops need the funding?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Thank you, Nedra. \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about our views on this bill. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for that. \xc2\xa0And for the back-and-forth between the House and the Senate, I\'m going to leave that to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Corker said yesterday that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you guys to rush to the deadline at the end of the month on the Iran negotiations, and said he would not support additional sanctions if fruitful talks were ongoing. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a sign from the top Republican in the Senate on defense issues. \xc2\xa0Is that something that you guys would agree to, that you would think about extending those deadlines if you feel like talks are being productive but you\xe2\x80\x99re not quite there at the deadline? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0We do think talks are being productive. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of progress made but there\xe2\x80\x99s still some work to be done. \xc2\xa0So we believe in that deadline and we\xe2\x80\x99re working towards it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about -- we now officially have the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s encyclical talking about climate change. \xc2\xa0Has the President seen that? \xc2\xa0And what is his reaction to the Pope taking such a strong stance?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kristen, I can tell you the President has been made aware of it, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a statement from the President for you shortly. \xc2\xa0But let me just give you quickly that the President does welcome the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s encyclical and admires the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make the case with the full moral authority of his position for action on global climate change. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President does look forward to discussing climate change with the Pope when he visits the White House later this year. \xc2\xa0And as we prepare for global climate negotiations in Paris this December, we hope that all world leaders will reflect on Pope Francis\xe2\x80\x99s call to come together to care for our planet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about the Conference of Mayors tomorrow -- what the President plans to highlight there and what are some of the key issues he plans to talk to them about?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I can, Justin. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have formal remarks to preview for you at this time. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that, as you all have noted, a lot of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s strategy over the past few years, given that Congress isn\xe2\x80\x99t always the most willing partner to advance the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy priorities, we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken our efforts to the state and local level, and a lot of those efforts have borne fruit.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think you can expect the President to talk about not only our efforts but a lot of the good work that mayors are doing on the local level on issues ranging from minimum wage, paid sick leave, childcare, pre-K, things like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President did visit Gap when he was talking about raising the minimum wage, and Gap did announce that they independently were doing so a year or two ago. \xc2\xa0Gap has now announced they\xe2\x80\x99re closing a number of their stores among some financial difficulties. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a reaction to that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think most of the science -- most of the data shows that raising the minimum wage increases productivity and increases a company\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line, in addition to supporting its workers. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One of the big topics of the conference is going to be this sort of water crisis, especially in California. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if you could talk first about if the President supports Governor Brown\xe2\x80\x99s approach to handling the water crisis there. \xc2\xa0And then I have a follow-up to that, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Justin, I can tell you that this administration is committed to doing everything we can to help the farmers, ranchers, small businesses and communities facing the severe impacts of the historic drought. \xc2\xa0As I think you all noted, just last week the administration announced new actions and investments of more than $110 million to support these communities suffering from drought and combat wildfires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis new funding announced last week builds on the more than $190 million that federal agencies across the government has invested to support drought-stricken communities so far this year. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One of the big themes of this -- of the drought -- has been sort of the targeting of celebrities and golf courses that have used large amounts of water. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the message of the President spending the weekend potentially at the exclusive private golf course of a billionaire that requires lots of water to maintain?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0You know this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to helping those affected by the drought is second to none, and I listed our most recent announcement, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to go over chapter and verse what more we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of any courses that the President may visit over the next few days, I know that many courses have taken water mitigation steps aimed at water conservation. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for those details.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What does the President hope to accomplish by doing the interview with the podcast guy tomorrow?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0The podcast guy?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is he going to do stand-up after he leaves the White House? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it on his bucket list?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Bucket. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0WTF with Marc Maron is a twice a week -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to say that on the record -- is a twice-a-week podcast hosted by Marc Maron from a recording studio in his garage. \xc2\xa0Yes, the President will be in his garage. \xc2\xa0And yes, we think this an opportunity to have an extended candid conversation, not necessarily about news of the day items, but I think this is going to be much more about areas of the President\xe2\x80\x99s life that don\xe2\x80\x99t always get reported in the news.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Like what? \xc2\xa0We report on everything, though. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I guess we know who will be the first downloader on Monday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Today the President is visiting two fundraisers. \xc2\xa0Will the press -- will this traveling press pool right here be allowed into each fundraiser? \xc2\xa0And if not, why not?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0David, we are going to abide by the press access coverage rules that have governed these for years now, including, by the way, being the first administration to allow print poolers into the private homes of fundraisers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so what -- but are we allowed in then, or not allowed in to both of the events today?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, one of them -- the first one is a roundtable, so there is no prepared remarks so there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any press coverage. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hillary Clinton will be doing fundraisers both in L.A. and San Francisco alongside the President, and also speaking at the Mayors Conference. \xc2\xa0Is there going to be any opportunity for the President and Secretary Clinton to catch up as they\xe2\x80\x99re one to do?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Justin, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that their travel plans will overlap, but I certainly am not aware of any occasion where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a chance to catch up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will she be the President\xe2\x80\x99s nomination for the ten-dollar bill? \xc2\xa0Or does he have a favorite right now? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I have not spoken to the President about his -- who he thinks is a frontrunner, but I encourage you all to go to \xe2\x80\x9cthe new 10\xe2\x80\x9d -- #thenew10 -- and you guys can weigh in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is he going to make a recommendation to Secretary Lew about who he thinks should be on it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kristen, as you know, this will ultimately be Secretary Lew\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but we do expect a lot of public engagement on this over the next while. \xc2\xa0We encourage folks to look at the website. \xc2\xa0And again, they can weigh in with #thenew10. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What has been the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to all the reports of his political demise in the wake of the trade vote? \xc2\xa0I mean, it looks like now there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for it still to be alive. \xc2\xa0And is the Iran deal possibly coming? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s been his reaction to those?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about this. \xc2\xa0 But I think -- he\xe2\x80\x99s acutely familiar with the ebbs and flows of Washington D.C. press coverage, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not where his focus is. \xc2\xa0His focus is on actually getting trade done and building an agreement with Iran that would rid itself of nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the President following the situation in the Palestinian territory, as it looks like the government is on the brink of collapse? \xc2\xa0Abbas has told Fatah that he is going to pull out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Andrew, I saw those reports, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my friends at the National Security Council. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:02 P.M.
