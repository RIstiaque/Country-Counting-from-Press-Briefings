EDT</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon and happy Friday, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I have a brief announcement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Friday, November 8, the President will travel to the New Orleans area for an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss the importance of taking measures to grow the economy and create jobs by increasing our exports.\xc2\xa0 More details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel will be released as they become available.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is my very brief topper, so I go to you.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the sum total of the week ahead?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the full week ahead for you at the end of your briefing, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has been briefed on the shooting at LAX.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us any more about who he was briefed by at the White House?\xc2\xa0 Anyone he may have talked to outside of the building?\xc2\xa0 And does he have any sense of what actually has happened in this incident?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been briefed on the incident at Los Angeles International Airport by Alyssa Mastromonaco, his Deputy Chief of Staff, and he will be regularly updated on unfolding events there.\xc2\xa0 At this point, the lead is LAPD, but we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously at the federal level in touch with law enforcement officials on the ground, and the President will be updated as the afternoon progresses.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And at this point, anything you can say about what he\xe2\x80\x99s been told, what the understanding is from officials on what\xe2\x80\x99s happened there?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I have no more information than what I think you\xe2\x80\x99re learning from reports out of L.A. right now to convey.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic, intelligence officials say that the leader of the Pakistani Taliban was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that he was killed?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No -- as you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak about operational matters.\xc2\xa0 But I would have to refer you to the Department of Defense for that.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last topic.\xc2\xa0 Edward Snowden appears to be reaching out to some other countries for help in trying to get the U.S. to drop these charges against him.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. talking to any countries -- Germany, in particular, is one country we know he\xe2\x80\x99s reaching out to -- to tell them what the U.S. would prefer they do in this kind of situation?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not aware of any conversations like that.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Snowden has been charged with crimes, and he ought to return to the United States to face those charges and avail himself of all the rights available to defendants in this country.\xc2\xa0 The crimes with which he\xe2\x80\x99s charged are very serious, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly our view that the right thing to do in this case is for him to return, or be returned, to the United States to face those charges and to have his day in court.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So beyond that, our position is what it was, which is that the unauthorized release of classified information, especially of the nature that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here, is harmful to the national security interests of the United States.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it complicates for allies like Germany, for example, their dealings with him perhaps, knowing that U.S. officials had been spying on their communications to their Chancellor?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, our view on what Mr. Snowden did I think is well known.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to the tensions caused by the disclosures that have appeared, because of those unauthorized leaks, we\'re handling those issues in our direct diplomatic communications with Germany and other nations and allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So we\'ve talked a lot about that, and there\'s no question that these are issues that we are addressing.\xc2\xa0 And they go to the heart of the overall review of our intelligence collection activities that the President has ordered up, and it\'s underway now.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Steve.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President aware that some of his advisors were talking about the idea of replacing Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p class="p1">**\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you asked, because I think it\'s important to know that campaigns and pollsters, as part of campaigns, test a lot of things.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you without a doubt is that the President never considered that, and had anyone brought that idea to him, he would have laughed it out of the room.\xc2\xa0 I think former Chief of Staff Bill Daley said as much this morning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And here\'s why:\xc2\xa0 Joe Biden has been an asset to this President in two campaigns and throughout five years of this administration.\xc2\xa0 Whether it was handling the implementation of the Recovery Act, handling the very sensitive and important portfolio of Iraq in the first term, or his key role in working with Congress on some very important negotiations, Joe Biden has been an excellent partner in the President\'s view.\xc2\xa0 And then, as a candidate, I think if you look at the role he played in 2012 and you look at the job he did in his debate, I think there is little doubt that he was an enormous asset to the entire cause and enterprise.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s how the President feels.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And having said that, I think you all know that he believes that Hillary Clinton did a magnificent job as Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 He believes he made the right choice in running mate.\xc2\xa0 He made the right choice in Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to 2012, I think the fact that the President became the first person to win more than 50 percent of the vote consecutively since <span class="s1">Ronald Reagan</span><span class="s2"> </span>Dwight D. Eisenhower tells you a lot about how effective that ticket was.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re saying he was aware of this or was not aware of this?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- look, I think if you ask the people who were more directly running the campaign that question, they might have an answer.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that he was aware of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I know for a fact that any suggestion that people periodically floated in the press that this was something under consideration was not one that he took seriously, ever.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, separately, Secretary Sebelius testified the other day that she did not have reliable enrollment data, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve since learned that only six people signed up on the first day.\xc2\xa0 Did she not have that data when she --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from selected, cherry-picked leaks from a Republican committee is that there are notes out there from a contractor that makes estimates about figures related to enrollees in the early days of this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">What\xe2\x80\x99s important to know is that the website wasn\xe2\x80\x99t functioning very well on October 1st or October 2nd; in fact, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been functioning well in the first month since the launch.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is so focused on making sure that everything is done to bring that website up to the standards he has for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So if the implication from this disclosure is that the website wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working effectively on October 1st, I think that is a dog-bites-man story.\xc2\xa0 We know that.\xc2\xa0 And when we have fully compiled data about enrollment in the middle of this month, for October, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to release it, which is what we said even prior to launch.</p>\n<p class="p3">But it\xe2\x80\x99s also instructive to remember that, setting aside any problems with the website, we knew and told you in advance that there would be low enrollment figures initially because we knew that from experience.\xc2\xa0 We saw that in the Massachusetts precedent, which the President himself spoke about just in Boston.\xc2\xa0 So, in fact, I think if you look at what happened in Massachusetts, something like 0.3 percent of what would turn out to be the enrollment figure in that insurance reform program is what they saw in the first month -- 123 people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So we knew it was going to be a slow build.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no question that it\xe2\x80\x99s been made more challenging by the poorly functioning website, and that\xe2\x80\x99s on us, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re dedicating the resources and the brainpower to get it fixed.\xc2\xa0 Because the central issue here, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about before, is not can we build a great website, it\xe2\x80\x99s can we make sure that the American people who deserve affordable, quality health insurance are able to buy it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is so frustrated by the website -- more frustrated than anyone else, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say.</p>\n<p class="p3">I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do what I did the other day, move up and back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Cheryl.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 What prompted the climate change executive order this morning?\xc2\xa0 Is there a particular problem that it\xe2\x80\x99s trying to address?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Climate change.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Climate change, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a very particular and important problem.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just very broad, very broad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall effort to address this challenge that our nation and the whole world is facing.\xc2\xa0 And he established a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to advise the administration on how the federal government can respond to the needs of communities nationwide that are dealing with the impacts of climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important about this task force is that it\xe2\x80\x99s basically tasking state and local officials who are on the ground and dealing with how to respond to or prepare for the changes brought about by alterations in our climate, so that they can feed back ideas and suggestions for best practices through this task force.</p>\n<p class="p3">So it\xe2\x80\x99s part of an overall approach to the problem, and I think it demonstrates that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to take it on from a variety of angles.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jon.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Joe and then Jon.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether the numbers from this war room meeting are accurate, six on the first day?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 HHS has put out a statement, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been available since yesterday on that, and where they believe it comes from.\xc2\xa0 I think these are rough figures, notes that were sort of a snap in time.\xc2\xa0 I think as the Secretary testified in a hearing, a lengthy hearing the other day, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to assemble accurate data and provide it monthly.\xc2\xa0 I think that one of the reasons why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to do it on a monthly basis is to make sure that the data is checked and is accurate.\xc2\xa0 Remember, it\xe2\x80\x99s coming in from a variety of places, both via the website and via -- from states who are running their own exchanges, from applicants who go through mail or go through in-person centers or through the call centers.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I would refer you to HHS or CMS for more on that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the whole point, regardless of how specifically accurate those numbers turn out to be, is that we know and acknowledge that the website has been a problem.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t -- excuse me.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s a transparency problem for the administration --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what Secretary Sebelius has said and I\'ve said and others have said is that we will provide enrollment figures on a monthly basis, which is entirely consistent with the way that other programs have provided information, and the reason to do that is because we want to make sure that it\'s accurate.\xc2\xa0 And, in this case, because the data is coming in from so many different places, you need to verify it and make sure that it reflects what\'s actually happening.\xc2\xa0 And we will do that.</p>\n<p class="p2">And look, let me just tell you now, on November 1st we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect those numbers to be very high, and we never did.\xc2\xa0 But they\'re going to be even lower because of the challenges we\'ve had with the website.\xc2\xa0 I think if Massachusetts is the precedent that makes sense to look at, and you look at what happened in the first month of enrollment in Massachusetts in what turned out to be a very successful enrollment period, you\'ll see that the first month is going to be slow as people begin to familiarize themselves with the options available to them and then make the choices that they want to make when it comes to their health care.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been sort of struggling a lot with numbers right now.\xc2\xa0 The President said the other day that just a small fraction of Americans would pay more.\xc2\xa0 Do you know what that fraction is?\xc2\xa0 Is it 2 percent, 3 percent?\xc2\xa0 And what, in terms of numbers, it works out to.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that figure, because here\'s the reality of what happens when you create a market that provides options to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So when you talk about -- and this is mostly focused, as we\'ve discussed in the past here, Joe, on the portion of just 5 percent of the population that currently is insured under the -- in the individual insurance market -- they often have one option, maybe one carrier and one plan available to them.\xc2\xa0 And every year that insurance company can say, you know what, your plan is canceled and here\'s your only option to replace it -- and it\'s usually a worse plan.</p>\n<p class="p2">What happens now to those individuals is they now have a variety of options.\xc2\xa0 They have levels of coverage that begin with minimum-level benefits that already exceed what they\'ve had available to them, and then they can choose from bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans, and they can also then look and see what kind of tax credits might be available to them because of their income level.</p>\n<p class="p2">So it\'s harder to predict with precision, because a lot of this depends on what choices individual consumers make.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that they have those choices I think is -- we have to acknowledge is a good thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last thing.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 By the way, it\'s good to see you here.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to see you, too.\xc2\xa0 Massachusetts -- you said many times that you think it\'s the proper template.\xc2\xa0 It was a completely different political climate in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\'re really choosing the right model?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in terms of the political climate, that certainly speaks to how the bill passed.\xc2\xa0 And look, nobody would have liked to have seen more bipartisan support for health care reform than the President, and I think as anybody here who covered it knows and can tell you, there was a great deal of effort that went into building a plan that reflected not just Democratic principles and Democratic ways to tackle this program, but Republican ways.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, as those of us who are old enough to have covered the health care debate under President Clinton in his first term, there was a Republican plan submitted at the time that is the closest precursor to what the Affordable Care Act is today.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of the ideas in the Affordable Care Act came from middle-of-the-road and conservative Republicans, and I think that reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s view all along that we ought to try to build a consensus here.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable, of course, that Republicans have instead fought this tooth and nail all the way.\xc2\xa0 They fought it through passage; they fought it through the many pointless repeal votes that they\xe2\x80\x99ve held in the House; and then challenged it unsuccessfully in the Supreme Court and then ran a national campaign on it, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out their way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we hope is that in the spirit of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s desire to help the American people, Republicans and Democrats can join together in making sure that the American people who have benefits available to them by law are getting the benefits that they deserve.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what Democrats did.\xc2\xa0 Democrats who opposed President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Medicare Part D plan, who voted against it -- once it was law, Democrats and Republicans came together when that program had a rocky rollout to make sure that their constituents got the benefits promised by the law.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope that lawmakers of both parties will join us in that effort.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said we\xe2\x80\x99ll get monthly enrollment figures, right?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said probably a dozen times from this podium.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, today is November 1st, and the rollout was October 1st.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at the one-month mark.\xc2\xa0 How many enrollees\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And as I probably said a dozen times, Jon, mid-month, which is consistent with every program like it.\xc2\xa0 We want this data to be accurate; we want it to be compiled; we want to verify it.\xc2\xa0 So this is not moving the ball.\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve said all along, middle of November we\'ll have October figures.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What I really want to ask you about is Joe Biden.\xc2\xa0 Did Vice President Biden know that the campaign was conducting polling and focus groups on the possibility of replacing him with Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I don\'t know the details of that.\xc2\xa0 I can point you to the people who ran the campaign, who, according to the book, had some of this work done.\xc2\xa0 And everyone to a person says this was never seriously considered.\xc2\xa0 It was something that the President would never have accepted.\xc2\xa0 And the idea was never brought to him.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve covered campaigns.\xc2\xa0 They poll and focus-group on what you had for breakfast.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they do.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they usually poll or focus-group on something that has an impact on the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I mean, why would the campaign be polling on what it would look like if Hillary Clinton replaced Joe Biden, if that was an idea never under consideration?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you ought to ask pollsters and those who ran the campaign.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President has in a partner, in Joe Biden, somebody who has been an enormous asset when it comes to governing here in Washington and an enormous asset in two national elections when it comes to campaigning.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, if you look back at 2012 and you look at that moment in the campaign when the Vice President had his debate, it was a key moment.\xc2\xa0 And Joe Biden delivered for the ticket.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s no question about that.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President knew he would.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he asked him to be his running mate in 2008.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why there was never any doubt among anybody here that he would be the running mate in 2012.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President enjoy spending quality time with Bill Clinton?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just another thing in the book.\xc2\xa0 It says that they did a round of golf; they couldn\'t get through 18 holes.\xc2\xa0 The President made a comment of he likes him, but in doses.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, here\'s two things I\'ll tell you about the book.\xc2\xa0 One, I haven\'t read it.\xc2\xa0 Two, I\'m sure it\'s filled with a lot of great color and detail about a campaign that like all national campaigns is filled with ups and downs and turns and twists.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure it will be a great read.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">What I can tell you is that the President is enormously grateful for the advice and assistance that he received from President Clinton during the campaign and the counsel he has received throughout his presidency from one of his only living predecessors.\xc2\xa0 And that relationship has only strengthened ever since the President, then senator, ran for the nomination against President Clinton\'s wife, then-Senator Clinton.\xc2\xa0 And I think you can see how that relationship only got stronger over the years, and it\'s very strong today.</p>\n<p class="p2">We were just in New York -- the Clinton Global Initiative in September -- and they have a very strong bond.\xc2\xa0 And I know that President Obama very much appreciates the counsel and advice he receives from President Clinton.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He never gets tired of it, never?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that congressional and administration officials, including national security staff here at the White House, met with a slew of representatives, EU representatives early this week regarding the so-called NSA spying concerns.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any updates?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that these meetings have improved relations between the U.S. and the EU?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the kind of communication we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with our European allies on this matter have been very important and very useful when it comes to making clear how much we value the kind of security cooperation that our nations have and that we have with Europe in general.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s vital when it comes to keeping Americans safe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s vital when it comes to keeping our European allies safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So as I said earlier, the tensions that have been caused by these disclosures are ones that we acknowledge, and they\xe2\x80\x99re ones that we are addressing directly in our communications with European nations and other nations who have been part of the disclosures.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think these tensions have been calmed in any way?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I obviously wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak for any European nation or any allied nation, but I would say that we believe that the kind of communication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in has been effective and useful in making clear how much we value those relationships, how important our cooperation is when it comes to national security issues and intelligence matters, and how much more broad our relationships are, because these are very important economic relationships as well as national security relationships.</p>\n<p class="p3">Daniel.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have a noisy demonstration out front by Camp Ashraf folks.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how hard is the President going to press the Iraqi Prime Minister on the issue of accountability for the killings that took place in September at Camp Ashraf?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President has meetings this afternoon with -- very shortly with Prime Minister Maliki.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you a readout of meetings that haven\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss a whole range of issues; this is I\xe2\x80\x99m sure going to be one of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But this is an important relationship, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that in the aftermath of the ending of the Iraq war and the withdrawal of U.S. troops remains important.\xc2\xa0 And our commitment remains very strong to Iraq and the assistance we provide them in dealing with their challenges from al Qaeda in Iraq, the renamed al Qaeda in Iraq, and dealing with their overall economic challenges as they continue to make progress out of the past that created so many problems for the Iraqi people.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the current position on who was responsible for that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you -- well, let me say this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure State Department has more on this for you, but I can tell you that we remain deeply concerned about the fate of the individuals abducted from Camp Ashraf as well as the security of the residents remaining in Iraq at Camp Hurriya.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing these matters actively and daily with UNAMI, with UNHCR, the government of Iraq and other relevant authorities, to seek information on the MEK members who went missing and to ensure as much protection as possible is provided for the residents who are at Camp Hurriya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, as I said, that these are the kinds of conversations we have with our counterparts as part of a whole array of topics that will come up.</p>\n<p class="p3">Major.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be as definitive about whether or not surveillance is going on at the IMF and World Bank as you have been with Chancellor Merkel?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, as I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we do not comment on specific reports about our intelligence-gathering activities.\xc2\xa0 All these matters are under review at the direction of the President, and --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know -- just a report that a decision has been made, and that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer going on.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you could --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this has come up with regards to different questions.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but we\xe2\x80\x99re duty-bound to ask.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, and it\xe2\x80\x99s fair.\xc2\xa0 And I can just tell you that all of these matters are under review.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to heads of state and also allies and friends, there\xe2\x80\x99s a special emphasis as part of the review in looking at intelligence-gathering activities.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, the issues that you raise and others are part of this review, and when that review is complete at the end of this year, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information that we can provide to you about decisions that are being made and changes that are being made in how we collect intelligence.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t even say whether a decision has been made about --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates that I can provide.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President spent two hours with Prime Minister Maliki yesterday, and as anyone who follows the Vice President and Iraq knows, he continues to have phone conversations with all the key players in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Will he be participating with the President in any post-game meetings?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House sort of view where Iraq is right now at either a crucial or tipping point as relates to the violence and all the other issues, parliamentary elections?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this a time where that portfolio that the Vice President has carried for five years becomes ever more significant?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important time for Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen has clearly escalated significantly, and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that we need to work together with other allies and friends of Iraq to help them counter the terrorism being perpetrated by al Qaeda there.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is a part of the conversations today, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he and the President will continue to discuss this very important foreign policy matter going forward.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it time for some fresh thinking as far as U.S. policy and what\'s going on in the post-pullout dimensions of Iraq?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, we\'re focused on providing the necessary assistance to Iraq to help them combat terrorism there, as well as the broader assistance that we provide through the Strategic Framework Agreement, and that encompasses not just the security relationship, but an economic and political relationship.</p>\n<p class="p2">Part of what Iraq has been going through for many years now is the effort to resolve the political differences and divisions within that country peacefully and through politics, rather than through violent conflict.\xc2\xa0 The forces of al Qaeda are trying to disrupt that, as they have periodically throughout this period.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And it\'s very important that, in spite of the differences that exist politically in Iraq, that the parties and the factions and the groups continue to resolve their own differences peacefully, which further isolates the activities of al Qaeda and demonstrates what they are for all to see, which is the wreaking of terrible violence upon innocent civilians that is damaging to every Iraqi.</p>\n<p class="p2">So our assistance encompasses more than just a level of security cooperation, although that\xe2\x80\x99s very much a part of it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you to address something that in this very busy news week has sort of filtered through some of the analysis of the President and his leadership style?\xc2\xa0 As I\'m sure you\'re well aware, and maybe others in the building are, there have been a number of stories suggesting the President has been indifferent or sort of an absentee, or lacking a central involvement in things very important not only to his agenda but to his overall projection of power.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to give you a chance to offer the White House a rejoinder to some of that analysis.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I know what you\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 I think that the -- I mean, I\'ll have to just address it specifically.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can\'t summarize everything.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no I know.\xc2\xa0 It was a good job.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But the -- I mean, let\'s take the piece that some have looked at when it comes to intelligence gathering.</p>\n<p class="p2">This President is a very deliberate consumer of the intelligence product provided to him, and he focuses on the things that are -- keep him up at night, which are the threats to the United States, the threats against the American people and the threats against our allies.\xc2\xa0 And that means North Korea, Iran, al Qaeda and other kinds of threats that are direct to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And you can be sure that he focuses on those issues.</p>\n<p class="p2">And this question has come with regard to some reports, and all I can say without commenting on specific intelligence-gathering matters is that when the President wants to know what the head of state of one of our allies thinks, the President calls him or her -- the President calls Chancellor Merkel or Prime Minister Cameron, or President Hollande.\xc2\xa0 So I think that answers that piece of the question.</p>\n<p class="p4">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to health care, this President has been focused from day one, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, on making sure that implementation will be carried out effectively.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the implementation of the website -- which is why nobody is more frustrated by the substandard performance of the website than the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that every effort is expended to bring it up to snuff.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the President expects results.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way he manages this White House.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way he manages this administration.\xc2\xa0 He believes that smart people ought to bring all their talents to bear to solving problems, but he expects results.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, on the question of the website and some other things, we\'ve asked questions, others.\xc2\xa0 Evidence has been raised of things that the President should have known, and either we can\'t find out if he did know or we\'re told it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether or not he knew.\xc2\xa0 And on the question --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you have to be more specific.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all along that we\'ve said we did not know -- imagine -- of course, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the website would perform as poorly as it has, otherwise we wouldn\'t have been speaking about it the way we --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but there were some tests right before launch, 200 people were on it --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what Secretary Sebelius has said and what Marilyn Tavenner has said is that they were told that the website would function.\xc2\xa0 It would not be error-free; there would be glitches, but that it would function.\xc2\xa0 And it clearly has not functioned up to the standards that we expected, which is why we\'re dedicating the resources we have and the brainpower we are to fixing it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because in the end, this isn\'t about a functioning website; it\xe2\x80\x99s about delivering affordable health care to millions of the American people.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on intelligence, there are many in the intelligence community who find it inconceivable the President couldn\'t know of all the things that have been disclosed.\xc2\xa0 And we were told the hard things -- the hard targets he knew about, the soft targets he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And that just seems to some on the outside not really the way a President would organize himself around intelligence matters.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I cannot answer every specific report about our intelligence-gathering activities.\xc2\xa0 I think I came pretty close to answering a question when I described the kinds of intelligence that that President focuses on and how he goes about having discussions with or learning the thinking of our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Iraq and the necessary assistance you talked about, there were obviously some lawmakers in this country talking about keeping some U.S. forces behind as part of the transition.\xc2\xa0 And the President decided not to do that.\xc2\xa0 As you noted, the violence has escalated.\xc2\xa0 Are there any regrets here about not leaving some U.S. troops there to try to help the situation?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The decision to fully withdraw from Iraq was one made by the Iraqi government and the United States government, and it was the right decision.\xc2\xa0 Because anyone who believes that the presence of U.S. troops -- 5,000, 10,000, 60,000, 100,000 -- in perpetuity is the answer to solving Iraq\'s political challenges I think is just simply wrong.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was part of a sustained debate in the 2008 campaign.\xc2\xa0 And the President was committed to ending the war in Iraq, and he has fulfilled that commitment.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t mean that we don\'t have an intense and focused relationship with Iraq going forward, including one that focuses on providing security assistance.\xc2\xa0 But Iraq has to resolve the challenges that face Iraq through intense political effort, and aided by the security forces -- the troops and police who have been trained by the United States and our allies in that effort -- and through the assistance that we provide them and other friends of Iraq provide them going forward.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, some administration officials have privately confirmed that these reports of Israeli war planes a couple of days ago striking a military base in Syria.\xc2\xa0 You also read out a phone call a couple of days between the President and Prime Minster Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Was this discussed on that call?\xc2\xa0 And what can you tell us about what the U.S. --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any further readout on that call, and I have no comment on those reports.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden, on that -- not about the book, but looking forward, in your answer you talked a lot about how they worked well together and the President thinks very highly of the Vice President, would have laughed off the idea of somebody wanting to take him off the ticket.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe the Vice President would be a strong President?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he ready to endorse him?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President picked Joe Biden as his running mate for the right reason, which is that if necessary, Vice President Biden could be President.\xc2\xa0 That\'s I think the first item on your checklist when you\'re picking a running mate.</p>\n<p class="p2">So what happens in 2016 is something that we\'ll see in 2016.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into 2016 right now, unless you want to -- we could talk about the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty interesting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please proceed.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you compare Rand Paul, Ted Cruz --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think they all ought to run.\xc2\xa0 It would be awesome.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last thing on -- if I could bring it back to health care.\xc2\xa0 You started out on this question of six people enrolling on day one by saying that numbers were "cherry-picked."\xc2\xa0 Obviously, these are HHS numbers.\xc2\xa0 I understand they\'re --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying the document released, as we\'ve seen again and again and again, in particular from this committee, is selected documents.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not contesting -- what I\'m saying is that is -- those are notes from a contractor, as I understand it, based -- and we\'re going about the business, as we promised, of gathering all the data, verifying all the data, and we\'ll provide it --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to prevent cherry picking, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you at least put out a reasonable preliminary number and show us some transparency?\xc2\xa0 Tell the public where we are.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to put out a reasonable, accurate number, as we promised we would, on a monthly basis consistent with the data released that you see for other programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And the focus here, for understandable reasons, I guess, is on how low the number might be.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- listen to me now -- they were always going to be low, the enrollment figures for the first month, because that\xe2\x80\x99s how enrollment periods work.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how Massachusetts worked.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how probably all the monthly enrollment you guys have on your plans work.\xc2\xa0 That has been compounded and will be compounded by the problems that we\'ve had with the website.</p>\n<p class="p2">So we expect those figures to be relatively low, but we absolutely expect those figures to grow -- and we always did.\xc2\xa0 And it is our challenge and our responsibility to make sure that we provide for the American people who want this product access to it through the website, through call-in centers, by mail, so that come January 1st and then by April 1st, everybody who wants affordable, quality health insurance on these marketplace is able to purchase it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\'re working hard on the goal here.\xc2\xa0 And the means to the end is only important because the means have to work to get you to the end.</p>\n<p class="p2">Yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be campaigning with Terry McAuliffe on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Does the fact that the administration is investigating Mr. McAuliffe\'s company present a conflict?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even sure what you\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Investigations are something that aren\'t handled here.\xc2\xa0 The President believes strongly that Terry McAuliffe is the right person for the job in Virginia, and I\'m sure looks forward to campaigning for him.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\'s not aware of the SEC investigation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying whatever investigation you\'re talking about is something for investigative authorities to comment on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Yes, Ari.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just talk broadly about what the President\'s message on Sunday is going to be?\xc2\xa0 In other years, we\'ve had the President giving a series of rallies and speeches, the message to the American people about who to choose.\xc2\xa0 This seems to be the only rally he\'s doing of this election cycle.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is an off year.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'m not saying he should be doing lots more, I\'m just saying given that this is the one speech of this kind he\'s going to give this year, what is it going to contain?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m sure he\'s going to say that Terry McAuliffe is the right choice for Virginia, and he\'s going to make an argument for why.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, you\'ll have to wait and see.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 I mean, like, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give us any kind of sense at all?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\'s official he\'s not campaigning with Barbara Buono?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on his schedule beyond Virginia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say somebody gets daily updates on enrollment figures in the administration?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the daily churn of this process, we set up briefings where they can --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand publicly.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying somebody every day is finding out, here are today\'s numbers.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to -- CMS might be able to tell you more about that.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is what the Secretary said.\xc2\xa0 We\'re compiling data.\xc2\xa0 You need to verify it and make it accurate.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the challenges in doing that have been exacerbated by the difficulties with the website.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what I --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President wanted an update right now, would somebody be able to provide him a number?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I suppose that somebody could provide a rough estimate, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 But the point is you want to get accurate information when you release it publicly.\xc2\xa0 And if the purpose of this line of questioning, which I know is of fierce interest to those who never wanted affordable health insurance available to the American people to begin with, is to demonstrate that those numbers are low, we concede that they will be.\xc2\xa0 We said that even before October 1st, before we had the trouble with the website, because that\'s how enrollment works.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you look at Massachusetts -- I mean, imagine what that must have looked like at the time.\xc2\xa0 They roll out this new health insurance reform program and Governor Romney signs it into law, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got bipartisan support, and they implement it, and after a month, they have 123 people sign up for it.\xc2\xa0 It turned out that more than 36,000 people signed up for it, but in that first month enrollment was low.\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be low here, too.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the important thing is that we provide steady improvements to the accessibility to the website and to accessibility to information and enrollment through the other means available so that the millions of Americans who want to shop for affordable health insurance through these marketplaces are able to do so.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly -- this rough estimate that was leaked, this is federal exchange only?\xc2\xa0 This is not counting state exchanges?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t even seen the document.\xc2\xa0 Chairman Issa didn\xe2\x80\x99t send it to me, so I don\'t --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that the United States has a special responsibility for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s safety?\xc2\xa0 Whether or not he believed in the war itself, does he believe the United States --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the United States to have a robust relationship with Iraq and to help Iraq deal with its security challenges, and to help Iraq deal with its overall challenges as it makes its way out of decades and decades of dictatorship and tyranny, and then a decade of terrible violence.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President does firmly believe that it was the right thing to do to end that war.\xc2\xa0 And he obviously believed that it was the wrong thing to do to get involved in that war.\xc2\xa0 But when he became President, it was his responsibility to make sure that we ended that war in a way that protected our national security interests.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You keep saying that the President does believe that he needs to provide a relationship that helps with security.\xc2\xa0 If Prime Minister Maliki is saying, hey, he needs even more help with security, does that mean the President would be open to some sort of special forces, some sort of troops?\xc2\xa0 Or is there sort of a line?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate -- no, I don\'t anticipate troops on the ground.\xc2\xa0 What I think will be a focus of the discussions is the ways in which the United States can provide assistance.\xc2\xa0 We are providing assistance and believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we make that case on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t expect any announcements, but if you\'re asking about boots on the ground, I think we\'ve made clear we withdrew from Iraq and we think that we can continue to provide assistance to Iraq in its effort against al Qaeda short of boots on the ground through our foreign military sales and through other means.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that Iraq is a robust democracy?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President believes what is accurate, which is that Iraq is a new democracy struggling with democratic governance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not alone in those kinds of struggles.\xc2\xa0 And I think Iraqis would be the first to tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s an imperfect democracy, to say the least.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important that Iraq make progress, and that it make progress by resolving political differences through political negotiation and through elections and through conciliation, and not through violence.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Olivier.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kind of building on that, the President has always reserved a right to use American military force against extremists when a local government cannot or will not.\xc2\xa0 There are now al Qaeda camps in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Is that option on the table for Iraq?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\'t have any military action to preview for you.\xc2\xa0 I think I answered the question about troops on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 One, on New Orleans, could you talk about the economic situation in New Orleans right now as the President is looking to talk about foreign trade, New Orleans and other countries around the world?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 About the specific situation economically in New Orleans?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a lot of data for you on it.\xc2\xa0 I think that obviously, New Orleans, in addition to being hit -- as the rest of the country was hit -- by the Great Recession, also had significant other economic challenges caused by Hurricane Katrina.\xc2\xa0 And this President has been focused on and dedicated to the effort to help New Orleans revitalize itself, and that effort continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to New Orleans to talk about the need to increase our exports, because increasing our exports helps grow our economy and helps create jobs here in the United States, including in New Orleans.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- seeing mostly --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have a further preview on it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure we\'ll have more details for you next week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask you this.\xc2\xa0 There are at least two principals in this administration that have great possibilities down the road.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about me again?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I am.\xc2\xa0 So will the President be strategic --\xc2\xa0 because in any kind of support that he may --</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering where it\'s going.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, listen, listen.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Will he be strategic in making any kind of support for any of these principals because they have far-reaching ramifications down the road for one or the other?\xc2\xa0 Or could we see a President who sits out until the general election?</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I have to tell you, on November 1st, 2013, the President is not thinking about 2016.\xc2\xa0 He is thinking about what he needs to do every day to make progress for the American people and the economy and on jobs; make progress in getting this website fixed so that Americans can have access to affordable and quality health insurance; making progress in our relationships with our allies, as well as in keeping the American people safe by continuing to take the fight to al Qaeda.</p>\n<p class="p3">So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about every day.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure 2016 will take care of itself.\xc2\xa0 This President has run for the last time, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously all watch with interest what happens, especially in the Republican Party.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when a Democratic President does not stand behind a Democratic candidate it shows.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re way ahead of the game here.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys are strategic.\xc2\xa0 You guys are already planning --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can promise you nobody is talking about that in the President\xe2\x80\x99s world right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Yes, Phil.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President decide not to campaign for Barbara Buono in New Jersey?\xc2\xa0 Has she asked for his help, and has he decided not to go there?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no information on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule politically beyond his visit to Virginia on Sunday.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he support her candidacy?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t been asked that question in a while.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you, Phil.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s the Democratic nominee on the ballot --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, and I think he met with her when he was in New Jersey earlier this year, I think it was.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether he supports her?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he supports her, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been up -- I honestly --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was the question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 I thought you were focused on whether he was going up to New Jersey.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Traveling is one thing, supporting is another.\xc2\xa0 He supports her?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Mike Viqueira.\xc2\xa0 Then Justin.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So the United Nations -- back on Iraq -- has got figures out today:\xc2\xa0 More than 900 Iraqis, 852 of them civilians, were killed last month alone; 5,000 since April.\xc2\xa0 You have repeatedly attributed the violence there to al Qaeda, but there are others, notably some very influential senators, who say that Prime Minister Maliki has mismanaged this situation, that he\xe2\x80\x99s fostered sectarian strife there of the type that\xe2\x80\x99s plagued Iraq over the course of the last 10 years.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d respond in two ways.\xc2\xa0 One, the violence is coming from al Qaeda and its affiliates.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any question about that.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to democratic governance and resolving differences between the parties and factions and ethnic groups and religious groups within Iraq, that\xe2\x80\x99s hard work and it\xe2\x80\x99s every leader\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility in Iraq to make sure that work is done in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t foster violence.\xc2\xa0 I think I answered earlier a question about the nature of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political system, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question it\xe2\x80\x99s a work in progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But make no mistake that the source of the violence is al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And I think that for Iraqis, that is something that is particularly painful, but also illuminating.\xc2\xa0 This is not the product of intra-party or intra-faction conflict.\xc2\xa0 This is Iraq once -- I mean, al Qaeda once again trying to destabilize Iraq and take advantage of the instability there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Justin.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Monday, it looks like the Senate will vote on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act for the first time since 1996, when it failed by one vote.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House doing to make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has long supported an inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would enshrine into law strong, lasting, and comprehensive protections against employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\xc2\xa0 And his administration has and will continue to work to build support for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">What we have seen is progress as that bill has moved through committee, and now will get a vote in the full Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re making clear to every senator who may be on the fence or may not have expressed support for it that we strongly believe that a \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d vote is the right vote on this legislation.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re working towards that end.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that it will pass?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think counting votes in the Senate is something that experts in the Senate do.\xc2\xa0 We know that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do and we fully support it.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on this?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chris.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The passage in the Senate of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, if it gets passed through that one chamber, would that change the landscape in the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on an executive order for prohibiting LGBT workplace discrimination for federal contractors?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to predict whether or not it would pass the House if it --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you if the Senate passed ENDA, would that change the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about the executive order for LGBT workplace discrimination?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that what I would say is that we have long believed that legislation, an inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act that would enshrine into law these protections, is the right way to go.\xc2\xa0 You and I have had this discussion periodically over the year.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s still our view.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in Congress.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that it\xe2\x80\x99s come further than I think some people expected a year ago, and we want to continue to see that progress in Congress.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a no?\xc2\xa0 That the Senate vote is not going to --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I answered the question expertly.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Week ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Knoller.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carney, thanks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What do you got?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you say the President is not thinking at all about 2016.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Guarantee it.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about 2014?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he wants to see lawmakers elected or reelected who want to focus on the problems that this country has and the challenges it faces when it comes to growing our economy and increasing employment and making the middle class more secure.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll do as presidents before him have done:\xc2\xa0 Get out there and support those candidates, Democratic candidates he believes have that as the focus of their agenda.</p>\n<p class="p3">Look, the President wants practical progress made in Washington.\xc2\xa0 The American people are crying out for it.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re tired of the kind of dysfunction that we saw during the shutdown.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re tired of the blame game that they see people engage in here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 They want their elected leaders focusing on them and their futures, not on their personal political futures.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is committed to doing.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not running again.\xc2\xa0 He wants progress.\xc2\xa0 He wants this economy to grow faster.\xc2\xa0 He wants it to create more and better jobs for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99ll be the message he carries in the midterm elections, when that time comes.\xc2\xa0 That time is still some ways off.</p>\n<p class="p3">In the meantime and throughout that time, he wants to focus on working with this Congress and doing everything he can with the executive authority he has to move the ball forward on the economy and on jobs.</p>\n<p class="p3">The week ahead -- schedule for the week of November 4, 2013.</p>\n<p class="p3">On Monday, the President will welcome the five-time Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, to the White House to honor the team and their 2013 Stanley Cup victory.\xc2\xa0 Following the visit, the President will deliver remarks at an Organizing for Action event.\xc2\xa0 That\'s Monday.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tuesday, the President will travel to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and visit with wounded warriors who are being treated at the hospital and with their families.\xc2\xa0 The President will also visit the Fisher House, a program that supports military families by welcoming them to stay at the house while their loved ones receive specialized medical care.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will travel to Dallas, Texas to participate in DSCC events.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier, on Friday, November 8, the President will travel to the New Orleans area for an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss the importance of taking measures to grow the economy and create jobs by increasing our exports.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more details on the President\'s travel as they become available.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Later that day, Friday the 8th, he will travel to Miami, Florida to participate in DNC and DSCC events.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">That, ladies and gentlemen, is your week ahead.\xc2\xa0 I hope you have a fantastic weekend.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll see you Monday.</p>\n<p class="p1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:41 P.M.
