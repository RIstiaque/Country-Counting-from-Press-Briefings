Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para">3:42 P.M. EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How\'s everyone?\xc2\xa0 Happy Monday.\xc2\xa0 Take us away, Ms. Loven.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right -- nothing from you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You guys want more news today?\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any news?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President pressed the Israeli Prime Minister on settlement, did he get any kind of satisfactory answer back?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think it\'s my place to readout what the Israelis said in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think the President reiterated his position strongly on settlements, as well as a number of other issues, like the necessity of a two-state solution.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would assume that when he felt the need to mention it publicly that he probably had not gotten the answer he wanted privately.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, these are ongoing conversations and ongoing discussions.\xc2\xa0 The President believed that the meeting was productive.\xc2\xa0 The meeting went -- far exceeded its allotted time, as we\'re now a good hour or so behind on the President\'s schedule for today.\xc2\xa0 And the President has already asked members of his team to follow up with the Israeli delegation and General Jones is going to go over and see his counterparts at 4:30 this afternoon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I don\'t think the President expected that we were going to wrap everything up in a couple-hour meeting in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes they were warm discussions and we\'re making progress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about a two-state solution?\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussion in their private meetings about the Prime Minister\'s position on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you heard both the Prime Minister and the President in the availability discuss the need to work toward the common goal of peace in the region.\xc2\xa0 The President continued to reiterate his position and the position of this government that the only way for that to happen is through a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s the President\'s position and he continued to reiterate it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President today appeared to set a rough deadline for negotiations with Iran, saying he wanted to see serious progress by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest some impatience on his part with the rhetoric emanating from Tehran, the fact that they\'ve so far rebutted his efforts to reach out to them?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- I wouldn\'t say that on this issue you would be frustrated by the rhetoric out of Iran.\xc2\xa0 I think you can take virtually -- you can take a lot of what they say and voice frustration about their rhetoric.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the President was clear that while he wasn\'t going to set an artificial deadline, the President has been firm on this that talking for talk\'s sake is not what he believes is in his interest or the interest of this country or in the interest of broader peace.\xc2\xa0 That obviously the Islamic Republic of Iran has -- he wants them to take their place in the international community if they\'re willing to live up to their responsibilities.</div> <div class="legacy-para">On the flip-side of that, it is important to -- I think as he said, it is clear that non-engagement, not having that diplomatic -- not using that diplomatic angle has been a failure.\xc2\xa0 And one of the best ways to galvanize the world is to give Iran the opportunity to accept those responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll get a sense of whether the Iranian government will accept those responsibilities.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what sort of signs of progress, though, is he looking for?\xc2\xa0 What does he want Iran to do?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get into grading different milestones or mile posts on this, except the understanding, again, that the President believes that what has failed is not engaging the Iranian government and the broader Iranian people.\xc2\xa0 And I think you heard the Prime Minister say that he shared the President\'s desire to seek a solution that worked.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he say that everything was on the same --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did who say that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President say that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President certainly has discussed in the past that we should keep all of our options open.\xc2\xa0 Sure.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Certainly no one would begrudge President Obama for attempting to get the peace process moving along.\xc2\xa0 But I was just wondering if you could share with us any possible reason for optimism -- you have an Israeli government that is conservative.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And even if Netanyahu supported a two-state solution it\'s unlikely that he\'d be able to get the Knesset to go along with it.\xc2\xa0 You have, as the President acknowledged, Egyptians allowing weapons to be smuggled into Gaza.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t even know what to say about the Palestinian government.\xc2\xa0 Why would President Obama feel any optimism beyond the fact that he\'s an optimistic guy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s certainly a good start.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But beyond that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you had the Prime Minister and the President both say they believed that we had a unique opportunity to seek long-term peace in the region.\xc2\xa0 Jake, I think the President would tell you that he doesn\'t expect any of this to be easy; that the fact that we haven\'t had it thus far underscores the complexity of the issues that are involved.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think as you heard the Prime Minister himself say in the availability, that there was a greater understanding amongst those that want peace now, an understanding of the common threat of our enemies than at any other point.\xc2\xa0 I think that certainly leads you to be optimistic.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Look, again, there\'s a long way to go, but the President believes the conversations were a good start.\xc2\xa0 He\'s met with others, including King Abdullah of Jordan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see later this month, Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Abbas.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, I think the President felt good enough to ask his team to follow-up again with the Israeli delegation this afternoon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think the President believes that there\'s enough reason to hope to continue working.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There has been in the past some people have proposed sending U.N. troops to the Palestinian Territories as a way to protect -- as a way to provide security for both parties.\xc2\xa0 Is that something President Obama would support?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think they got into that level of detail today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, couldn\'t you make the argument, though, that Mr. Netanyahu actually got more out of this than the President did?\xc2\xa0 He made Mr. Netanyahu --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\'re as optimistic as Jake --(laughter) -- it seems as if each is leaving --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m never optimistic, Robert.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, look at what came out of it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Mr. Netanyahu did not define the two-state solution, did not say that he\'s for it.\xc2\xa0 The settlements, right now they\'re letting new contracts for construction on the West Bank in a certain settlement, Maskiot, if that\'s proper pronunciation.\xc2\xa0 And the President actually came out with a stronger definition on Iran, putting a timetable, which is something that the Israelis have been looking at.\xc2\xa0 So what was accomplished?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think -- I think you heard the President and the Prime Minister both agree that each thinks, and we\'ve long thought, that nuclear weapons in the hands of the Iranians was a bad deal for both nations and a bad deal for the world.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard them both reiterate that.\xc2\xa0 I think you did hear the President reiterate his strong position and his strong belief that the only way that we\'re going to have peace in the region is through a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 That\'s his belief.\xc2\xa0 We think that the Prime Minister is -- the Prime Minister set forth that he believes that we have to work toward that common goal of peace.\xc2\xa0 And I heard the Prime Minister also support the President\'s policy of engaging Iran.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think there\'s hope and there\'s optimism.\xc2\xa0 But again, this is -- maybe we\'ve gotten you too conditioned to good progress if you thought after two hours we were going to walk out with a big deal.\xc2\xa0 We understand it\'s a long road and the President is willing to use his time and his energy to slowly make progress towards a long-term peace in the region.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is this threat from Iran?\xc2\xa0 Who has --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you match the rhetoric of their leadership in wiping Israel off the map --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen the rhetoric of United States and Israel, as well, that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s been rhetoric, amazing rhetoric in the last two or three years against Iran.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think I would match the rhetoric of President Obama with the rhetoric of Iranian leadership in threatening and vowing to seek the capability --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) also.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\'ve discussed, Helen, I\'m the new spokesperson for the incoming administration, or the current administration, not the previous one.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is some history, though, with --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In Israel?\xc2\xa0 Several thousand years, I\'m told.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But, look, I think if you match the nuclear weapons capability with the rhetoric of the Iranian government there is certainly cause -- there\'s always cause to be concerned, that\'s why --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you give me a quote from them to say what they\'re going to blow up and so forth?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly provide you some quotes after the briefing of what they\'ve vowed to do.\xc2\xa0 We can certainly -- somebody can Google that and we\'ll send them to you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When Governor Granholm comes tomorrow, would she be talking to the President at all about the Supreme Court vacancy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the governor\'s primary objective in coming is an announcement we\'ll make tomorrow on a different topic.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any secondary objectives -- about the Supreme Court?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I feel good about my first answer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which brings me to my question.\xc2\xa0 Why does the President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I yield to the gentleman from CBS.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, you\'re not finished, sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Five minutes to the gentlemen in the natty blue tie.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, not five minutes -- (laughter).\xc2\xa0 Let me -- hold on -- the chair takes back his time.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead -- yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 I realize, what am I thinking?\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does the President feel this is a good time to change CAFE standards when the automobile industry is in pretty serious trouble?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I assume that\'s why the governor is coming tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think it\'s a surprise that the administration has been working with states, the industry, environmental groups, and all those that are concerned about efficiency and our independence on foreign oil, to seek an agreement that helps move that progress forward.\xc2\xa0 You know, Bill, it was -- it\'s been more than -- until 2006 or early 2007, I believe, that we saw any progress over the course of more than two decades in updating our fuel mileage standards.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ve heard the industry discuss on many occasions having a certainty in the standards that are desired as they produce cars in this country, and I think tomorrow you\'ll see people that normally are at odds with each other in agreement with each other building off of some of the very same developments on other energy issues and health care that you saw last week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is going to be a kind of kumbaya session with the industry and the governor?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'re supposed to play the guitar and I\'ll do some singing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Somebody suggested that Speaker Pelosi should come forward with the evidence of her allegation that the CIA misled her.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree that she should have some evidence --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I appreciated the opportunity to get involved in this on Friday and I declined, and I haven\'t changed my mind on Monday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have confidence in Speaker Pelosi?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Jonathan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear anything about the NASA administrator and hear it today and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You won\'t hear it today because of the Netanyahu meetings going longer.\xc2\xa0 The visit with Mr. Bolden will be tomorrow morning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, over the weekend your budget director, Peter Orszag, said that it felt like the economy had bottomed out, sounded like the rebounds are coming.\xc2\xa0 Do you share that optimism and what gives you a sense that the economy is now beginning to turn the corner?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- look, Jonathan, on any number of days there are statistics that are good and that provide hope and there are statistics that underscore the many challenges that we have.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve seen over the course of the past several weeks an inflection point change in some of those statistics that denote we\'re not sliding as far and as fast as we did in previous months at the beginning of the year.\xc2\xa0 But I think that is to say that the President understands that until we\'re making -- until we see positive growth, until we see jobs created in this economy, that he won\'t rest in working to see a greater recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I certainly agree with Peter, but I think Peter would also be the first to tell you that the President believes that we\'re not looking to -- we\'re not looking to see it bottom out, we\'re looking to see it both bottom -- we\'re looking to see it bottom out and to see progress on growing this economy for middle-class America.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, is there an agenda for this President\'s Economic Recovery Advisory Board meeting on Wednesday?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we can -- we\'ll probably have more information on that tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Mark.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you give us an overall status report on where the search for a Supreme Court nominee stands?\xc2\xa0 Has he had any interviews yet?\xc2\xa0 Should we expect an announcement this week?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has not had any interviews as of yet.\xc2\xa0 An announcement could come as soon as the President makes a selection.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I figured I\'d give an answer equal to the "Can you let us know when the announcement is going to come?"</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like the China ambassador, it will come more than a week later.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say again?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it like the China ambassador, it will just come a week after he makes a decision?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you never know.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as soon as the President has an announcement you\'ll be among the first to know.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'ll interview the person first, though, right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be interviews before an announcement?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, Mark, if you\'re interested, I\'ll give your resume to Bill.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have there been any?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have there been any interviews?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not as of yet.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could go back to the CIA and Pelosi and just try this one different way.\xc2\xa0 But Panetta has issued his statement.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with Panetta that the CIA is not in the business of misleading members of Congress?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the opportunity.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to my remarks from Friday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we can kind of be in limbo on whether or not the President agrees with the CIA director?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu said, among many things, that for the negotiations he wants to restart with the Palestinians to bear fruit, the Palestinians must not only recognize Israel, but recognize it as a Jewish state.\xc2\xa0 That would seem to place off the table the longstanding right of return issue, which has always been a final status issue in these talks.\xc2\xa0 Is that how the White House interprets that particular formulation?\xc2\xa0 And does that in any way prejudge the outcome of the talks that Prime Minister Netanyahu said he wanted to restart?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will certainly check with some of our negotiators on that.\xc2\xa0 But I do not believe that that -- I don\'t believe that prejudges any outcome.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, this is the first of what we assume will be many discussions on a series of topics.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But, again, I think the President thought that today was a step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve got a long way to go.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a theory that Annapolis is the road map now, but in the very near future, the President will chart a new road map, quite possibly in the speech in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Is right now Annapolis the road map for this administration, or is it actively contemplating something to succeed it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President mention in his remarks today the process that was set out by the road map, including the strong endorsement again of a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the -- that\'s where he\'s headed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there no contemplation of something broader or more ambitious than Annapolis?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see what comes of the future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Court, is the President going to begin interviews this week?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s entirely possible, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I appreciate the opportunity to inform you of each and every person that the President sees on this topic, but I\'m not likely to do it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be more than one?\xc2\xa0 Is he contemplating just one interview as sort of the closer?\xc2\xa0 Or would he clearly interview more than one --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a typing test.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the process, interviewing more than one is going to be his approach?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is going to interview people he thinks that are qualified, and make a pick as to the person he thinks is best qualified.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Sheryl.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President still expect to close Guantanamo Bay one year after his announcement, which would be I guess January 20, 2010?\xc2\xa0 And is --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s the 21st or 22nd, but, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Twenty-first, thank you.\xc2\xa0 And is he still planning on issuing a detailed map, if you will, of how to get there in another two months from now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand the second part.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he not say on January 22nd that within six months he would sort of issue -- the administration would issue plans for how it intended to close Guantanamo?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to go back and look.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, Sheryl, the President remains committed to closing Guantanamo.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On January 22nd?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On whatever date he previously intoned in the executive order.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\'s still confident that he can do that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 There are multiple task forces that are -- have been stood up, and are meeting to deal with the issues surrounding that closure.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what will we hear from him Thursday in his speech?\xc2\xa0 Will he address how he plans to get there?\xc2\xa0 And also, will he talk about the military commissions decision?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he talked about the military commissions decision in a statement Friday.\xc2\xa0 And I took a few questions, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He talked in a written statement, not in his own lovely tones.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I saw that statement appear in your newspaper, if I\'m not mistaken.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, it was brief.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will discuss in some detail issues surrounding detainees in detention on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have more on that as we get a little bit later into the week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President seemed intent today on trying to send messages, or it could be interpreted as sending messages for Iran -- sort of a stern warning to them, you know, they should change course, and several other comments that could be interpreted as sort of a stern warning.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I just wondered if you agree that was one of his intents today in communicating publicly, both for Iran\'s benefit, but also for Mr. Netanyahu\'s benefit.\xc2\xa0 And he also seemed to be irritated by one question about whether his willingness to talk with Iran could be interpreted as weakness.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel any pressure to show that he\'s more than just talk on this issue?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, let me take the -- well, look, Jon, I don\'t think the rhetoric was markedly different today than what it\'s been throughout this process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the context was obviously --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the context obviously is different when you\'re sitting next to the Prime Minister of Israel.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, as we\'ve said throughout this process, that the path that they\'re on now is not one that he believes is in our interest, the interest of the Israelis, or as he said today, even the interest of the Iranians; that -- I think he said on any number of occasions that discussions and engaging the Islamic Republic of Iran are not simply to talk for talk\'s sake.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier, we have to -- we recognize that not engaging in any way Iran over the past several years has not gotten us anything; that the President believes that through the process of beginning with the P5-plus-1 that we should engage the Iranians to have them accept their responsibilities to the international community.</div> <div class="legacy-para">At the same time he understands that that\'s not going to go on forever and that we\'re not going to do that just to do it.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 What are you saying?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I mean is we\'re not going to -- it was shorthand for saying we\'re not going to talk for talk\'s sake.\xc2\xa0 The object of having talks of engagement with Iran are not simply to say we\'ve had talks with engagement.\xc2\xa0 It\'s to make substantive changes in their pursuit of nuclear weapons.</div> <div class="legacy-para">What was the second part?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, if I could just -- I guess my follow-up would be is there any sense on the President\'s part that--</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yours was the irritation.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll get to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think this is in line with that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there a sense in his mind that he needs to counteract the thought out there that he\'s not going to follow up his action -- his words with action?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- look, we\'ve had a debate for the better part of two years about whether we should engage or not engage the Islamic Republic of Iran.\xc2\xa0 I think in many ways that has been settled over the course of both the primary and the general election.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time I think you heard the President say, and I think you -- as you said, there were -- he had stern words for the Iranian government about the responsibilities they have and the path that he believes is dangerous for us, for them, and for the entire region; that what could be borne out of their pursuit of a nuclear weapon is a regional nuclear arms race that\'s not in anybody\'s interest.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So again, I think the President is willing to engage in diplomacy, but understand that we have to -- while we undergo that diplomacy we have to see from the Iranians the understanding that they\'ll live up to those obligations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Christi.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During his public comments the Prime Minister didn\'t fully embrace -- or didn\'t embrace a fully sovereign Palestinian state.\xc2\xa0 But was there any indication at all that there was movement on that Issue?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to get into characterizing parts of the talks from the perspective of the Israelis, except to reiterate that I think both believe that we\'re at a unique opportunity and that our common goal is to peace.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also say why -- you mentioned that the meeting ran quite a bit beyond its allotted time.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about why that was, tell us anything about what was going on in the room, the history between the two?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you in there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No -- well, I was in for a portion of -- well, obviously for the avail.\xc2\xa0 I was also in for a portion of some note-taking activities where I guess there were two of us and two on the other side.\xc2\xa0 But the portion that went over was the one-on-one portion.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I can get an exact amount of time, but they were at least a half-hour over on that side just in the one-on-one discussions that were being had.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think both leaders thought the conversations were constructive and desired to continue to have them.\xc2\xa0 An aide went in once to tell the President he was off schedule and he nodded, and he came back out.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much beyond that did the meeting go?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 About 25 minutes, at least.\xc2\xa0 I was next up to have to go in and -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the President tell you why?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just, again, that they thought it was constructive -- the conversations were constructive and didn\'t want to have to necessarily abide by an artificial timeline of when they were going to end.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask this one thing.\xc2\xa0 Some people thought they saw friction between the two men in the room in the joint availability.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair read in your opinion?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have -- what\'s the basis of the friction?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was the general impression about body language, sort of leaning --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The fact that they were sitting in different chairs?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I hesitate to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the end the President did seem a little, I don\'t know, not warm.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he seemed to kind of end it very quickly.\xc2\xa0 That could be nothing, but --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At that point I think they\'d been in there for the better part of two hours.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- generally if you don\'t think things are going well and you\'re not having a constructive conversation, I don\'t normally think that those are conversations that extend by 30 to 45 minutes through the allotted time.\xc2\xa0 Generally those are conversations that tend to end before the allotted time and then you play music and fill the time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they still go to lunch?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\'re giving us a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, actually that\'s a real world example.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Generally, if the meeting is long, then it\'s productive?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I -- well, my point is, if things are going so badly, if there\'s so much friction and so much bad body language, why would one stay in there a half an hour longer?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\'t -- I guess I don\'t understand why --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Along these lines, Robert, will there be any sort of joint statement to emerge from this encounter today from the two governments?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think past what they both did at the availability.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So nothing formulated to state something they mutually agreed upon today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President expect Israel to agree to a two-state solution when Hamas, which rules Gaza, insists on a one-state solution and the end of Israel?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President discussed directly with the Prime Minister, as you heard him say, the need to do all that we can to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the obligation of all involved as well as the obligation, as you\'ve heard the President say both in visiting parts of Israel that are shelled by rockets as well as today, that the mutual -- there\'s mutual security obligations on the part of the Palestinians, and that the best way to minimize the -- any impact that Hamas has is to address both of those concerns directly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe his CIA chief was right or wrong?\xc2\xa0 That\'s all.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We did this earlier.\xc2\xa0 You can do that from earlier.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few weeks ago, the President said that he was expecting both sides in the Middle East to come up with some goodwill gestures in the coming months.\xc2\xa0 Did he hear anything today that leads him to suspect that something might be forthcoming from Israel in the near future?\xc2\xa0 Did they talk about Gaza humanitarian access, for example?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, they certainly -- that was one of the topics.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that -- the President reiterated his desire to move on a relatively narrow, quick timeline towards comprehensive peace in the region.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that peace in the region should also be met, he believes, with gestures of normalization by the -- by Israelis\' Arab neighbors.\xc2\xa0 I think that and a whole host of things were discussed as part of the meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly, to close the circle on NASA, is Bolden the President\'s choice and will that happen tomorrow?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get ahead of the President\'s meeting with him, but I know he\'s anxious to have strong leadership at NASA.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve all watched and read about the mission that\'s going on right now and the amazing efforts that are being undertaken with consecutive, multi-hour space walks to repair the Hubble telescope.\xc2\xa0 So we may have something after that meeting but not until then.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on CAFE, is this an example, what you\'re announcing tomorrow, of sort of a crisis helping lead to an opportunity to step up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there has been a crisis for quite some time in ensuring certainty for automakers, I think there\'s been a crisis for quite some time in the emission of dangerous greenhouse gases, and I think there\'s been a crisis for quite some time in our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 What I think you\'ll likely see tomorrow are groups that are normally aligned against each other working together and in concert to address the challenges that we face.\xc2\xa0 And I hope it won\'t be lost on people that what they are likely to see are people that for, as I said earlier, two decades couldn\'t agree on updating emissions and fuel efficiency standards.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ll see tomorrow important groundbreaking steps on that effort.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Margaret.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 Syria did not come up in the public part of their discussion.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if we should read that as a sign of progress to the extent that it came up and it was agreed not to say anything bad about Syria or whatever?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a progress report on Syria in the context of --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\'t know if it came up in a private discussion.\xc2\xa0 But I can certainly check with Dan and those guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My other question was Netanyahu, despite his caveats -- which seemingly would stop the process before it started -- he said he wants to immediately reengage the peace process.\xc2\xa0 So, like, what happens next in the sense of the immediacy of the re engagement?\xc2\xa0 Is there at some point after Mubarak and Abbas come next week -- at some point are there plans for Israel and those leaders that you can specifically get into?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about the next steps insofar as the larger meetings.\xc2\xa0 Again, what I said a minute ago, the next step is General Jones at 4:30 p.m. is going to go meet with his counterparts based on progress that the President and the Prime Minister think can be made in the short term.\xc2\xa0 I think those are the immediate next steps in the process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">April.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To change the subject for a moment, there\'s some rumblings about historically black colleges and universities.\xc2\xa0 One, did the President receive any invitations from any HBCUs to be the commencement speaker?\xc2\xa0 And what colleges?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to ask the scheduling office.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what we were invited to and what we didn\'t accept.\xc2\xa0 I simply know what we have accepted, and how I spent my Sunday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand one was by Morehouse College for the same date as Notre Dame yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And what goes into --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, then why did you ask me the first question?\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t you just ask me if Morehouse invited us the same day as Notre Dame?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to know --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s like I\'m playing the Jeopardy version of -- I\'ll take HBCUs for $200.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Honestly, I didn\'t know the answer for the first, so it\'s hard for me to underscore the second, because as I told you a second ago, I don\'t know what we were invited to and I don\'t know what we were invited to and didn\'t agree to.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the other side of the HBCU issue, there is some rumblings from historically black college and university presidents about the cut, the $85 million cut, to HBCU\'s Title III -- that\'s for programs to include -- what is it -- monies for projects, equipment replacement, launching new programs, offsetting facilities, faculty, and staff, things of that nature.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re saying, you know, this administration is saying that that money has been used to boost Pell Grant monies, increase Pell Grant monies, but at the same time many of the presidents are saying that issue is financial aid, that has nothing to do with Title III.\xc2\xa0 And they want to know why was that cut made?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can talk to the budget people.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have information on that level of specificity on the Title cuts, but I can certainly --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They are concerned.\xc2\xa0 They feel that this administration is turning a blind eye to historically black colleges and universities.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on the facts.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the commitment that this President has made education in a very short period of time through a lot of the spending in the Recovery Act denotes that he believes that in order to lay the new foundation for economic growth, education is a key part of it.\xc2\xa0 And I think his commitment is underscored in those resources that have been laid out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President supported the Defense of Marriage Act -- for repeal of that during the election.\xc2\xa0 Now that same-sex couples can marry legally in five different states, what is the President doing to make sure that those marriages can be recognized at the federal level?\xc2\xa0 And what\'s the time line for something like that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- I have to go check on that.\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\'t know the answer to that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Newsweek reported this week that the President urged, I guess by way of telling Speaker Pelosi, that a truth commission should include immunity for witnesses that testify.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate and if so why --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not read Newsweek -- I have not read that article in Newsweek.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s viewpoint on a commission has been expressed by him and by me, that if we want to look at what has happened in the past, that ability and responsibility rests with congressional committees like the Intelligence Committee that have the ability to do it.\xc2\xa0 His position on that is the same.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  4:21 P.M.
