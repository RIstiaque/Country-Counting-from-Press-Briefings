Washington Convention Center<br/>\n\tWashington, D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t6:09 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Good evening, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I want to begin by thanking the people of Washington, D.C. for hosting us, especially for putting up with more than 50 motorcades.\xc2\xa0 And I will make one promise to the people of this city -- I will not hold another one of these summits in another six years.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to thank everyone who participated in our meetings -- more than 50 leaders from every region of the world and key international organizations.\xc2\xa0 As at our previous summits, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t just come here to talk, but we came here to act.\xc2\xa0 I know that the very technical nature of nuclear security doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always make for flashy headlines.\xc2\xa0 But over the past six years, we have made significant, meaningful progress in securing the world\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear material so that it never falls into the hands of terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And I want to take a few moments to step back and lay out exactly what we have accomplished.</p>\n<p>\n\tTogether, we have removed the world\xe2\x80\x99s most deadly materials from nuclear facilities around the world.\xc2\xa0 With Japan\xe2\x80\x99s announcement today, we\xe2\x80\x99ve now removed or secured all the highly enriched uranium and plutonium from more than 50 facilities in 30 countries -- more than 3.8 tons, which is more than enough to create 150 nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 That\'s material than will never fall into the hands of terrorists.</p>\n<p>\n\tFourteen nations and Taiwan -- countries as diverse as Argentina and Chile, to Libya and Turkey, to Serbia and Vietnam\xc2\xa0 -- have now rid themselves entirely of highly enriched uranium and plutonium.\xc2\xa0 In particular, I want to point out again that successfully removing all of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s highly enriched uranium four years ago meant that the very difficult situation in Ukraine over the past two years was not made even more dangerous by the presence of these materials.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs of today, South America -- an entire continent -- is completely free of these dangerous materials.\xc2\xa0 When Poland completes its removal this year, central Europe will be free of them as well.\xc2\xa0 When Indonesia completes its work this year, so will all of Southeast Asia.\xc2\xa0 In other words, as terrorists and criminal gangs and arms merchants look around for deadly ingredients for a nuclear device, vast regions of the world are now off-limits.\xc2\xa0 And that is a remarkable achievement.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress in the United States as well. In addition to the new steps I announced this morning, we\xe2\x80\x99ve improved nuclear security and training.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve consolidated nuclear materials at fewer facilities, eliminated some 138 tons of our surplus highly enriched uranium -- which would be enough for 5,500 nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 Working with Russia, we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to eliminate enough Russian highly enriched uranium for about 20,000 nuclear weapons, which we are converting to electricity here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore specifically, as a result of these summits, every single one of the more than 50 nations represented here have taken concrete steps to enhance security at their nuclear facilities and storage sites.\xc2\xa0 And that includes improved physical security, stronger regulations, abiding by international guidelines, greater transparency, and that includes international peer reviews.\xc2\xa0 Fifteen new centers have been created around the world to promote nuclear security technologies and training, to share best practices.\xc2\xa0 And as part of our work today, we agreed to keep strengthening our nuclear facilities\xe2\x80\x99 defenses against cyber-attacks.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve bolstered international efforts to disrupt nuclear smuggling.\xc2\xa0 The Proliferation Security Initiative has grown to more than 100 nations, including regular exercises to improve our collective ability to interdict shipments.\xc2\xa0 The United States and 36 partner countries have worked to install radiation detection equipment at more than 300 international border crossings, airports and ports.\xc2\xa0 And we are developing new mobile detection systems as well.\xc2\xa0 And finally, as I noted this morning, we\xe2\x80\x99ve strengthened the treaties and international partnerships that are a foundation for so many of our efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, we have made significant progress.\xc2\xa0 And everyone involved in this work -- especially our teams, who have worked tirelessly for years -- can take enormous pride in our achievements.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, as I said earlier, our work is by no means finished.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a great deal of nuclear and radioactive material around the world that needs to be secured.\xc2\xa0 Global stocks of plutonium are growing.\xc2\xa0 Nuclear arsenals are expanding in some countries with more small, tactical nuclear weapons, which could be at greater risk of theft.\xc2\xa0 And as a consequence, one of the central goals of this summit was how do we build on the work that has been done so that we have an international architecture that can continue the efforts, even though this is the last formal leaders\xe2\x80\x99 summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo even as this is the last of those leader-level summits, today we agreed to maintain a strong architecture, including through the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and INTERPOL, to carry on this work and to provide the resources and technical support that is needed to continue this mission.\xc2\xa0 And we are creating a new nuclear security contact group -- senior-level experts from more than 30 of our countries -- who will meet regularly to preserve the networks of cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve built, to institutionalize this work, and to keep driving progress for years to come.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt our session on ISIL this afternoon, there was widespread agreement that defeating terrorist groups like ISIL requires more information-sharing.\xc2\xa0 Everybody understands the urgency in the wake of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Brussels and Turkey, Pakistan, and so many other countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 As a consequence, our Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, is continuing to engage with intelligence leaders from a number of our European partners on deepening our cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And today, I invited all the nations represented at this summit to join a broader discussion among our intelligence and security services on how we can improve information-sharing within and among our nations to prevent all manner of terrorist attacks, especially those that might involve weapons of mass destruction.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn closing, I just want to say that preventing nuclear terrorism is one part of the broader agenda that I outlined seven years ago in Prague -- stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and seeking a world without them.\xc2\xa0 In recent days, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no shortage of analysis on whether we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved our vision, and I\xe2\x80\x99m the first to acknowledge the great deal of work that remains -- from negotiating further reductions with Russia to dealing with North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I indicated in Prague, realizing our vision will not happen quickly, and it perhaps will not happen in my lifetime.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Russian nuclear arsenals are on track to be the lowest that they have been in six decades. I\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced the number and role of nuclear weapons in our nuclear security strategy.\xc2\xa0 In a historic deal, we\xe2\x80\x99ve prevented the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran.\xc2\xa0 An international fuel bank is being built to promote civil nuclear cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m extremely proud of our record across the board.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep pushing forward wherever we can, as I hope future administrations do, to bring us closer to the day when these nuclear dangers no longer hang over the heads of our children and our grandchildren.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, let me take a few questions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about Iran.\xc2\xa0 And three weeks ago, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Leader complained that his country has not been getting actual business deals since the nuclear agreement.\xc2\xa0 And non-U.S. companies are saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard, or sometimes impossible, to do much business with Iran without at some point accessing the U.S. financial system to do U.S.-dollar-denominated transactions.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, are you considering allowing such transactions?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is that not a betrayal of your assurances that most U.S. sanctions would stay in place?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not actually the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.\xc2\xa0 So let me say broadly that so long as Iran is carrying out its end of the bargain, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the world community to carry out our end of the bargain.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey have, in fact, based on the presentations that were made by the IAEA this morning to the P5+1, have, in fact, followed the implementation steps that were laid out.\xc2\xa0 And as a consequence, sanctions related to their nuclear program have been brought down.\xc2\xa0 Part of the challenge that they face is that companies haven\xe2\x80\x99t been doing business there for a long time, and they need to get comfortable with the prospects of this deal holding.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that Secretary Lew and his counterparts within the P5+1 and elsewhere are going to be doing is providing clarity to businesses about what transactions are, in fact, allowed.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take time over the next several months for companies and their legal departments to feel confident that, in fact, there may not be risks of liability if they do business with Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so some of the concerns that Iran has expressed we are going to work with them to address.\xc2\xa0 It is not necessary that we take the approach of them going through dollar-denominated transactions.\xc2\xa0 It is possible for them to work through European financial institutions, as well.\xc2\xa0 But there is going to need to be continued clarification provided to businesses in order to -- for deal flows to begin.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what I would say is also important is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s own behavior in generating confidence that Iran is a safe place to do business.\xc2\xa0 In a deal like this, my first priority, my first concern was making sure that we got their nuclear program stopped, and material that they already had that would give them a very short breakout capacity, that that was shipped out.\xc2\xa0 That has happened.\xc2\xa0 And I always said that I could not promise that Iran would take advantage of this opportunity and this window to reenter the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tIran, so far, has followed the letter of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 But the spirit of the agreement involves Iran also sending signals to the world community and businesses that it is not going to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that might scare business off.\xc2\xa0 When they launched ballistic missiles with slogans calling for the destruction of Israel that makes businesses nervous.\xc2\xa0 There is some geopolitical risk that is heightened when they see that taking place.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Iran continues to ship missiles to Hezbollah, that gets businesses nervous.\xc2\xa0 And so part of what I hope happens is we have a responsibility to provide clarity about the rules that govern so that Iran can, in fact, benefit, the Iranian people can benefit from an improved economic situation.\xc2\xa0 But Iran has to understand what every country in the world understands, which is businesses want to go where they feel safe, where they don\'t see massive controversy, where they can be confident that transactions are going to operate normally.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an adjustment that Iran is going to have to make as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, frankly, within Iran, I suspect there are different views.\xc2\xa0 In the same way that there are hardliners here in the United States who, even after we certify that this deal is working, even after our intelligence teams, Israeli intelligence teams say this has been a game-changer, are still opposed to the deal on principle, there are hardliners inside of Iran who don\'t want to see Iran open itself up to the broader world community and are doing things to potentially undermine the deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so those forces that seek the benefits of the deal not just in narrow terms but more broadly, we want to make sure that, over time, they\'re in a position to realize those benefits.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Nakamura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks, you just finished a working session with 50 world leaders about combatting terrorism and groups like the Islamic State.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to ask you specifically about one of the strategies, prime strategies your administration is using in that effort.\xc2\xa0 In the past several weeks, your administration has killed well over 200 people in airstrikes in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen, according to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 How can you be certain that all the people killed posed an imminent threat to the United States?\xc2\xa0 And why is the United States now killing scores of people at a time, rather than eliminating individuals in very targeted strikes?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 We have constructed a fairly rigid and vigorous set of criteria for us evaluating the intelligence that we receive about ISIL, where it might be operating, where al Qaeda is operating.\xc2\xa0 These guidelines involve a whole range of agencies consulting extensively, and are then checked, double-checked, triple-checked before kinetic actions are taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for the most part, our actions are directed at high-value targets in the countries that you just described, outside of the theater of Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, what we\'re seeing are camps that after long periods of monitoring becomes clear are involved in in directing plots that could do the United States harm, or are supporting ISIL activities or al Qaeda activities elsewhere in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, if after a long period of observation, we are seeing that, in fact, explosive materials are being loaded onto trucks, and individuals are engaging in training in small arms, and there are some of those individuals who are identified as couriers for ISIL or al Qaeda then, based on those evaluations, a strike will be taken.\xc2\xa0 But what we have been very cautious about is making sure that we are not taking strikes in situations where, for example, we think there is the presence of women or children, or if it is in a normally populated area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd recently we laid out the criteria by which we\'re making these decisions.\xc2\xa0 We declassified many elements of this.\xc2\xa0 We are going to be putting forward and trying to institutionalize on a regular basis how we make these evaluations and these analyses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, in terms of the broader debate that\'s taking place, David, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been in the past legitimate criticism that the architecture, the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn\'t as precise as it should have been, and there\'s no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn\'t have been.\xc2\xa0 I think that over the last several years, we have worked very hard to avoid and prevent those kinds of tragedies from taking place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn situations of war, we have to take responsibility when we\'re not acting appropriately, or where we\'ve just made mistakes even with the best of intentions.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re going to continue to try to do.\xc2\xa0 And what I can say with great confidence is that our operating procedures are as rigorous as they have ever been and that there is a constant evaluation of precisely what we do.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol Lee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve spent seven years now working on nonproliferation issues, and you said in your opening remarks that you hope that future administrations do the same and make it a priority.\xc2\xa0 This week, the Republican frontrunner to replace you said that perhaps South Korea and Japan should have nuclear weapons, and wouldn\'t rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe.\xc2\xa0 Did that come up at this summit?\xc2\xa0 And just generally, what message does it send when a major-party candidate is articulating such a reversal in U.S. foreign policy?\xc2\xa0 And also, who did you vote for in the Democratic primary?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, it\'s a secret ballot, isn\'t it, Carol?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not going to tell you now.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat do the statements you mentioned tell us?\xc2\xa0 They tell us that the person who made the statements doesn\'t know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt came up on the sidelines.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before that people pay attention to American elections.\xc2\xa0 What we do is really important to the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 And even in those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections because they understand the President of the United States needs to know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on around the world and has to put in place the kinds of policies that lead not only to our security and prosperity, but will have an impact on everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s security and prosperity.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur alliance with Japan and the Republic of Korea is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 It has underwritten the peace and prosperity of that region.\xc2\xa0 It has been an enormous buoy to American commerce and America influence.\xc2\xa0 And it has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation and conflict between countries that, in the past and throughout history, have been engaged in hugely destructive conflicts and controversies.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you don\'t mess with that.\xc2\xa0 It is an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made back in World War II when they were fighting throughout the Pacific.\xc2\xa0 It is because of their sacrifices and the wisdom that American foreign policymakers showed after World War II that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to avoid catastrophe in those regions.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn\'t recognize how important that is.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew Beatty.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you met with President Erdogan of Turkey hours after some fairly ugly scenes at the Brookings Institution.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, do you consider him an authoritarian?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Turkey is a NATO ally.\xc2\xa0 It is an extraordinarily important partner in our fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It is a country with whom we have a long and strategic relationship with. \xc2\xa0And President Erdogan is someone who I\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with since I came into office, and in a whole range of areas, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a productive partnership.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is also true, and I have expressed this to him directly, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that there are some trends within Turkey that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been troubled with.\xc2\xa0 I am a strong believer in freedom of the press.\xc2\xa0 I\'m a strong believer in freedom of religion.\xc2\xa0 I\'m a strong believer in rule of law and democracy.\xc2\xa0 And there is no doubt that President Erdogan has repeatedly been elected through a democratic process, but I think the approach that they\'ve been taking towards the press is one that could lead Turkey down a path that would be very troubling.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we are going to continue to advise them -- and I\'ve said to President Erdogan, remind him that he came into office with a promise of democracy.\xc2\xa0 And Turkey has historically been a country in which deep Islamic faith has lived side by side with modernity and an increasing openness.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the legacy that he should pursue, rather than a strategy that involves repression of information and shutting down democratic debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, I want to emphasize the degree to which their cooperation has been critical on a whole range of international and regional issues, and will continue to be.\xc2\xa0 And so as is true with a lot of our friends and partners, we work with them, we cooperate with them.\xc2\xa0 We are appreciative of their efforts.\xc2\xa0 And there are going to be some differences.\xc2\xa0 And where there are differences, we will say so.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what I\'ve tried to do here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll take one last question.\xc2\xa0 This young lady right there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, President.\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, what do you think --</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Where are you from, by the way?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am from Azerbaijan.\xc2\xa0 How can Azerbaijan support in nuclear security issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, Azerbaijan, like many countries that participated, have already taken a number of steps.\xc2\xa0 And each country has put forward a national action plan.\xc2\xa0 There are some countries that had stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that they agreed to get rid of.\xc2\xa0 There are other countries that have civilian nuclear facilities but don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have the best security practices, and so they have adopted better security practices.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are countries that could potentially be transit points for the smuggling of nuclear materials, and so they\'ve worked with us on border controls and detection.\xc2\xa0 And because of Azerbaijan\'s location, it\'s a critical partner in this process.</p>\n<p>\n\tI should point out, by the way, that although the focus of these summits has been on securing nuclear materials and making sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t fall into the hands of terrorists, the relationships, the information-sharing, the stitching together of domestic law enforcement, international law enforcement, intelligence, military agencies, both within countries and between countries -- this set of relationships internationally will be useful not just for nuclear material, but it is useful in preventing terrorism generally.\xc2\xa0 It\'s useful in identifying threats of chemical weapons or biological weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the clear messages coming out of this summit and our experiences over the last seven years is an increasing awareness that some of the most important threats that we face are transnational threats.\xc2\xa0 And so we are slowly developing a web of relationships around the world that allow us to match and keep up with the transnational organizations that all too often are involved in terrorist activity, criminal activity, human trafficking, a whole range of issues that can ultimately do our citizens harms.\xc2\xa0 And seeing the strengthening of these institutions I think will be one of the most important legacies of this entire process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMark Landler, since you had your hand up, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on you.\xc2\xa0 One last question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask a question about nuclear policy.\xc2\xa0 Through these past seven years when you\'ve pushed to rid the world of nuclear materials and fissile material, the U.S. nuclear industry has actually worked to improve miniaturization of warheads.\xc2\xa0 And while it has not developed new classes of cruise missiles or warheads, it\xe2\x80\x99s worked to improve the technology.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s prompted some in China and Russia to say, well, gee, we need to keep up.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that the technological advances in the United States have had the effect of sort of undermining some of the progress you\'ve made on the prevention side?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate question, and I am concerned.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the balance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to strike.\xc2\xa0 We have a nuclear stockpile that we have to make sure is safe and make sure is reliable.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd after the START II Treaty that we entered into with Russia, we have brought down significantly the number of weapons that are active.\xc2\xa0 But we also have to make sure that they\'re up to date; that their command and control systems that might have been developed a while ago are up to snuff, given all the technology that has changed since that time.\xc2\xa0 And we have to make sure that our deterrence continues to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so even as we\xe2\x80\x99ve brought down the number of weapons that we have, I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to make sure that what we do retain functions -- that it is not subject to a cyber intrusion; that there\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient confidence in the system that we don\'t create destabilizing activity.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy preference would be to bring down further our nuclear arsenal.\xc2\xa0 And after we completed START II, I approached the Russians -- our team approached the Russians in terms of looking at a next phase for arms reductions.\xc2\xa0 Because Mr. Putin came into power, or returned to his office as President, and because of the vision that he\xe2\x80\x99s been pursuing of emphasizing military might over development inside of Russia and diversifying the economy, we have not seen the kind of progress that I would have hoped for with Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is that the possibilities of progress remain. We are abiding by START II.\xc2\xa0 We\'re seeing implementation.\xc2\xa0 And although we are not likely to see further reductions during my presidency, my hope is, is that we have built the mechanisms and systems of verification and so forth that will allow us to continue to reduce them in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe do have to guard against, in the interim, ramping up new and more deadly and more effective systems that end up leading to a whole new escalation of the arms race.\xc2\xa0 And in our modernization plan, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to strike the proper balance, making sure that the triad and our systems work properly, that they\xe2\x80\x99re effective, but also to make sure that we are leaving the door open to further reductions in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut one of the challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have here is that it is very difficult to see huge reductions in our nuclear arsenal unless the United States and Russia, as the two largest possessors of nuclear weapons, are prepared to lead the way.\xc2\xa0 The other area where I think we\xe2\x80\x99d need to see progress is Pakistan and India, that subcontinent, making sure that as they develop military doctrines, that they are not continually moving in the wrong direction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have to take a look at the Korean Peninsula, because the DPRK, North Korea, is in a whole different category and poses the most immediate set of concerns for all of us, one that we are working internationally to focus on.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why we had the trilateral meeting with Japan and Korea, and it was a major topic of discussion with President Xi, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you very much, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t6:42 P.M.
