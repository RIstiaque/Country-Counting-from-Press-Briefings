EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to the great state of Iowa.\xc2\xa0 As we did last week, Jen and I will be briefing together.\xc2\xa0 I will take questions on matters of policy.\xc2\xa0 You should direct campaign-related questions to Jen.\xc2\xa0 Some questions will have elements of both in them, and we\'ll try to answer them accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re doing this together to basically make it as efficient as possible for you all, since this is, in fact, a campaign trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t have any announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 You saw the President yesterday put forward his proposal that in the midst of a broad stalemate on some very important issues, he believes that we can create some certainty for 98 percent of Americans and some good for our economy if we come together on something that we all agree on in Washington, which is the need to extend the middle-class tax cuts that 98 percent of American taxpayers pay.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Congress were to do that tomorrow, he would sign it tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And we can debate about whether or not now is the time to give additional tax cuts to the top 2 percent of American earners, the top 2 percent of the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it is not -- that that\'s not good policy.\xc2\xa0 Republicans believe that it is.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a clear area of disagreement.\xc2\xa0 Where there\'s an area of agreement is that the rest of America, the 98 percent should not see their taxes go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s pass that right away.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to give two flags for today.\xc2\xa0 One is that on the way to the grassroots event the President will be doing at Kirkwood Community College, he\'ll be meeting with a middle-class family -- Ali and Jason McLaughlin.\xc2\xa0 They have a son, they have a child on the way.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve benefited to date by about $4,900 in tax cuts from the President\'s plan, and they\'re very concerned, as millions of middle-class families are around the country, about their taxes going up if we don\'t extend middle-class tax cuts now.\xc2\xa0 So he\'ll be talking with them about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing I wanted to flag is that we will -- also the campaign will be putting out reports in about a dozen states today laying out the contrast between President Obama and Mitt Romney\'s plans for taxes -- for tax cuts I should say.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney has a plan that\'s a $5 trillion tax cut plan focused on millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t explained how he\'d pay for it, so either he\'ll blow up the deficit or he\'ll raise taxes on families like those in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 So look out for those today as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Your questions, please.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, will we hear anything from the President about Romney\'s tax accounts overseas and will we see tax returns today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You will hear the President lay out the difference in vision that he has with Mitt Romney, what he wants to do in fighting for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That includes extending the tax cuts now.\xc2\xa0 That includes providing affordable\xc2\xa0 -- access to affordable health care, access to education.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe campaign has put out some details in a fact sheet on offshore -- on sending jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to provide that to anyone today.\xc2\xa0 But the President will be focusing his remarks on the contrasting vision when you hear him speak in Iowa later this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything at all about -- I meant to say bank accounts, not tax accounts, overseas.\xc2\xa0 Anything about that, regarding his opponent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, since you\'ve given me the opportunity to speak to it, I will say that there still remain a number of serious questions about where Mitt Romney is investing, what he\xe2\x80\x99s invested, what it means.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re an average Iowa family, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to the bank around the street, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a question that I think a lot of people have raised about why would he have had an account in Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 Why did he have investments in the Cayman Islands?\xc2\xa0 He was running a hedgefund -- you may or may not know this -- for three years with major investments in the Cayman Islands.\xc2\xa0 He has an over $100 million IRA that\xe2\x80\x99s based there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of questions that people want answers to, and the ball is really in Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s court and his team\xe2\x80\x99s court to release the tax returns so we can get those questions answered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, can you talk about why Iowa today?\xc2\xa0 Is there a particular urgency that the campaign is starting to feel about Iowa particularly in contrast with his performance there in the 2008 election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, Amy, as you know and many people know, Iowa is where this journey began.\xc2\xa0 It will always have a special place for the President in his heart.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage anybody to read the remarks he gave the night he won Iowa.\xc2\xa0 I was there; many people were there.\xc2\xa0 He talked about a couple of things -- fighting for access to affordable health care, ending the war in Iraq, giving the tax cuts to middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s delivered on all of those.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say repeatedly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIowa is a place -- the tickets for this event today were gone in 24 hours, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a really positive response in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 We know that the Republican candidates just spent a year campaigning there and organizing there, but we feel good about where we are and we feel great about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had strong grassroots support in this state for five years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s not a heightened sense of urgency about Iowa today than a few months ago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re coming here because this is a state where we want to compete, we want to win, and the President cares deeply about the people here and he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to seeing some familiar faces.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, the campaign finance numbers came out the other day.\xc2\xa0 It was the second month in a row that the President was outraised by Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 What are you guys trying to do to change course on that?\xc2\xa0 And is this basically a two-month blip -- similar to what we saw in 2004 with President Bush and John Kerry, or is something different happening here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, first I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it was our best month to date.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we were outraised.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying we\xe2\x80\x99d be outraised for some time, so it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come as a surprise to us.\xc2\xa0 In there, there was some good news for us, which was almost 200,000 new donors.\xc2\xa0 The average donation -- 98 percent of people gave less than $250.\xc2\xa0 Average size was just over $50.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are people who are excited, who want to get involved. We want to make them volunteers; we want to make them phone bankers.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to fight to get every last dollar just like we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting to get every last volunteer, and we encourage any of you to go to our website and donate.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the deficit, though, that could be forming, does that present problems for your battleground states, your infrastructure, your ability to actually get people out to the polls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you mentioned and touched on, and I\'ll just add on this -- back in 2004 -- and I worked for John Kerry\xc2\xa0 -- so back in 2004, he outraised President Bush several months after the nomination.\xc2\xa0 That\'s common.\xc2\xa0 There\'s often a common bump where the nominee gets a fundraising bump.\xc2\xa0 So we knew to expect that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s all about how you spend your resources and how you invest them as well, and how you excite and energize your supporters -- including Democrats, but also including independents.\xc2\xa0 We feel good about how we\'ve decided to spend our resources -- opening offices, hiring field workers, making sure we have the resources and assets on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s where our focus was in 2008 and where it will be in 2012.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about the veto threat that both you made from the podium and that the President then made in at least one of those interviews last night.\xc2\xa0 So, so far you both have said that he would sign -- that he wants the one-year extension of the tax cuts up to $250,000, and that he would veto any effort for the extension of the full Bush-era tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 But what neither of you have said is would he veto anything above the $250,000 extension?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 The options on the table are the President\'s proposal to extend tax cuts to 98 percent of taxpaying Americans, those making $250,000 or less, or the Republican proposal, which is to insist on extending not just those tax cuts but tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the 2 percent of top earners in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President would not sign a bill that extended the tax cuts for the wealthiest earners.\xc2\xa0 We cannot afford it.\xc2\xa0 He would veto that bill if it were to arrive on his desk.\xc2\xa0 He obviously supports and has long supported extending tax cuts for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe could go dollar by dollar and engage in hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 Those are the only two bills that are going to be voted on as far as I know, and those are -- the President\'s position on those two bills could not be more clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to just follow up.\xc2\xa0 The art of the compromise is -- I understand there\'s nothing on the table right now for some amount in the middle.\xc2\xa0 But by not saying that the veto threat kicks in at $250,000 and one cent, you\'re certainly leaving the impression that there\'s some room for negotiation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- leaving that impression.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s position is clear -- 98 percent of American taxpayers must have the certainty that their taxes will not go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the position he has held for years.\xc2\xa0 And he re-established it again yesterday when he put forward a proposal that said, let\'s do something that we all agree on, which is extend those tax cuts to middle-class Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has long opposed extension of the high-income tax cuts because we can\'t afford it, because we know it\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy, because we know economically at a macro level that tax cuts that go to the wealthiest earners do not have the same kind of positive impact on economic growth that tax cuts to middle-class Americans have.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s his policy position.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in negotiations that might take place in November and December now.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s calling for a piece of legislation to be acted on now.\xc2\xa0 And he has not engaged in a negotiation about other dollar amounts; $250,000 is the limit.\xc2\xa0 That covers virtually 98 percent of taxpaying Americans, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a similar percentage, if not higher, of taxpaying Iowans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we cannot -- people talk a lot about the fiscal cliff, economic uncertainty that it creates.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together to resolve some of that uncertainty for the heart of America, for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 They should just do it and stop holding 98 percent of taxpaying Americans hostage to tax cuts for the top 2 percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- reach out to the campaign or how -- out of the 98 percent of the people, how did they pick this family?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 Typically what happens is our local supporters, our campaign identifies a family or a personal story, just like with what happened when we introduced (inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 Let me find exactly how we found them and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you talked about the President\'s push for legislation.\xc2\xa0 Jen has talked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s push for tax legislation.\xc2\xa0 He announced it from the White House.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s now taking it on the road and campaigning.\xc2\xa0 Is this a White House issue, or is this a campaign issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s both.\xc2\xa0 He would, as I said yesterday, welcome the opportunity to take this issue off the table.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans in Congress were to act and send him -- join with Democrats and send him a bill that extended tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans this week, he would sign it this week, and then that debate is over.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have learned as a legislative issue, as a policy issue is that positions that the President takes and Republicans oppose -- well, let me put it this way -- that when the President proposes something and brings it to the American people, Republican opposition often wanes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a couple examples of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Payroll tax cuts, student loans, STOCK Act, Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 Basically, every significant piece of legislation that\'s been accomplished in the last six months that this President signed into law has been a result of the President making a case to the American people about why his vision for what needs to be done is one that most Americans share, and arguing that they should then make that clear to their representatives in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And this is another one of those situations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know that Republicans have, by and large, insisted on holding tax cuts for the middle class hostage to their insistence that the wealthiest Americans get additional tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 That\'s their position, the polar opposite of the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that if the President makes his case to Americans around the country, that the Republican position will become increasingly untenable, and that we can then accomplish something for the American people now before the election -- because, in fact, one of the reasons why it is untenable is because the Republicans say they want these tax cuts extended.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is this going to be the same message that we hear in Virginia on Friday and Saturday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, who knows what will happen in the next three days.\xc2\xa0 You will hear the President talk about the differing visions he has for moving the country forward from Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 He will talk today about tax cuts specifically, his call yesterday to extend them for one year for the middle class, and why that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 If we can all agree on this, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we moving forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tI just want to add one thing to what Jay said, is that the question also should be posted to the Republicans and to Mitt Romney, if this is an area we can agree, why can\xe2\x80\x99t we move this ball forward now so that we can debate about the other issues later?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a question we\xe2\x80\x99re all wondering.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about the differing visions as well as tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear some of that again in Virginia, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that on Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you look at the guidance on the McLaughlin family, what he\'s planning on saying today, is all this on taxes?\xc2\xa0 Is there a jobs message in there?\xc2\xa0 Is he bringing a jobs message to Iowa?\xc2\xa0 Will he be bringing one to Virginia?\xc2\xa0 Or is that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 There are many different issues that fall into\xc2\xa0 -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, are about the economic security of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Of course jobs, providing people access to jobs, investing in jobs of the future -- that\xe2\x80\x99s innovation, that\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, that\xe2\x80\x99s clean energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he also feels that middle-class families that are struggling, that are trying to dig themselves out from the recession, need help in areas like access to affordable health care, access to tax credits to help them get a good education.\xc2\xa0 So these are all areas that squeeze the middle class.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about all of them today, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to over the course of the next few months.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And if I could just add as a matter of policy make that point that I made before that it is widely established among independent economists that tax cuts to ordinary Americans, middle-class Americans, have, as a rule, a much more positive impact on economic growth in the near term than tax cuts to the wealthiest, because the wealthiest are less likely to spend that money, whereas average Americans, ordinary Americans, middle-class Americans are trying to make ends meet and, by and large, that money goes straight back into the economy, which helps the economy grow and helps to create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any foreign leader calls today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have none to report, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any comment on this new framework that Kofi Annan has been presenting to try to end the violence in Syria?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, Annan also met with some Iranian officials.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any view on whether Iran could have a positive role here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On Iran, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody with a straight face could argue that Iran has had a positive impact on developments in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our view.</p>\n<p>\n\tBroadly, on the Annan plan, we believe that it is essential that the international community come together behind the plan, that the plan be implemented, and that the transition that the plan calls for does not include President Assad.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made that case very clearly to all the "Friends of Syria" and all our international partners.\xc2\xa0 And that is a view that is widely held among interested parties around the globe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we remain highly skeptical about Assad\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to meet his commitments, which is another reason why Syria\'s future cannot plausibly have Bashar al-Assad in the government.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s long since lost his credibility.\xc2\xa0 He will go down in history as a brutal tyrant who murdered his own people.\xc2\xa0 And we call on members of his inner circle, senior members of his government and his military to break with Assad, to break with that tyrant, and to do so on behalf of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also call on other nations to recognize the obvious, which is that allying with Bashar al-Assad is allying with a tyrant and putting your nation on the wrong side of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you follow up about the message on whether it\'s going to be about jobs?\xc2\xa0 Will the President continue to talk about outsourcing, and is that message made a little bit more difficult right now by the media reports and the Republicans recent sort of seizing on the limits of what President Obama has done to limit outsourcing in his first term?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start.\xc2\xa0 I would say, first of all, the truth -- oh sorry -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a loud plane.\xc2\xa0 The truth sometimes hurts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s true for Mitt Romney and his record on outsourcing.\xc2\xa0 The facts are very clear on this.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney not only supported outsourcing as governor, he benefited financially from companies that outsourced at Bain, and he supports giving tax credits to companies that ship jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn contrast, the President has been fighting against outsourcing throughout his career over the last four years.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s pushed to give tax credits to companies who bring jobs back here, to end tax credits for companies that are sending jobs overseas, and he\xe2\x80\x99s doubled the rate of enforcement against China as well.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s taken a number of steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe understand why the Romney campaign wants to try to muddy the waters here, but as I said to start with, the facts are very clear and the contrast between their records couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more clear either.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a matter of policy, I think Jen got it just right.\xc2\xa0 You just have to look at the facts, and what the President supports and the efforts he\xe2\x80\x99s made both in terms of enforcement of fair trade practices, with the actions taken before the WTO against China -- a seventh one just taken recently, the previous six having been successful -- as well as his very clear position on rewarding companies that bring jobs back and removing the incentive that Republicans support to reward companies for moving jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy position, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear which side he\xe2\x80\x99s stands on.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t11:00 A.M.
