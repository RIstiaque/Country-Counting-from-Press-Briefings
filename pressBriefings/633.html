Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:56 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience today.\xc2\xa0 The Cabinet meeting ran a little long, and then, obviously, as I think some of you saw, Secretary Kerry and his counterpart spoke in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to allow you the opportunity to see that before I came out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Before I take your questions I wanted to make two statements.\xc2\xa0 First, on Wednesday -- this coming Wednesday, at 10:45 a.m., the President will address business leaders at the quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable.\xc2\xa0 The event will take place in D.C. at the Business Roundtable office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, if I may, I\'d like to point you to a new report that was released today by the Department of Health and Human Services, showing that 6.8 million consumers saved an estimated $1.2 billion on health insurance premiums in 2012 because of the part of the Affordable Care Act called rate review that brings sunlight and scrutiny to insurance premiums.\xc2\xa0 Now, in every state, insurance companies are required to submit for review and justify any proposed health insurance premium increase of 10 percent or more.\xc2\xa0 In other words, the days when insurers could post double-digit insurance premium increases without transparency and accountability are over.</p>\n<p>Now, this is one of many ways that American families are saving under the health law.\xc2\xa0 For example, the 80/20 rule, which requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health care or provide rebates to their customers, saved 77.8 million consumers $3.4 billion up front on premiums last year.\xc2\xa0 This is separate from and in addition to the savings I mentioned at the top.\xc2\xa0 Also, insurers that did not meet the 80/20 rule provided 8.5 million Americans with $500 million in rebates, averaging $100 per household.</p>\n<p>So today\xe2\x80\x99s news is the latest example of how the Affordable Care Act, along with state efforts, continues to bring scrutiny to health insurance rate increases and is saving consumers real money as a result.</p>\n<p>Now I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about two issues, one on Syria and the other one on the budget.\xc2\xa0 On Syria, I wonder what the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction was to President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed piece in The New York Times today.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker called it insulting.\xc2\xa0 I wonder what the President thought of it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say this.\xc2\xa0 Both in his op-ed and in the statements and actions that we\'ve seen from President Putin and his foreign minister, it is clear that President Putin has invested his credibility in transferring Assad\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons to international control and ultimately destroying them. This is significant.\xc2\xa0 Russia is Assad\xe2\x80\x99s patron and protector, and the world will note whether Russia can follow through on the commitments that it\xe2\x80\x99s made.</p>\n<p>As for the editorial, we\'re not surprised by President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that Russia offers a stark contrast that demonstrates why America is exceptional.\xc2\xa0 Unlike Russia, the United States stands up for democratic values and human rights in our own country and around the world.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that our global security is advanced when children cannot be gassed to death by a dictator.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that Russia is isolated and alone in blaming the opposition for the chemical weapons attack on August 21st.\xc2\xa0 There is no credible reporting -- and we have seen no credible reporting -- that the opposition has used chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we have been joined by now 34 countries in declaring that the Assad regime is responsible for the use of chemical weapons on that night.\xc2\xa0 Even Iran, which is fighting on Assad\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in Syria, has publicly blamed the Assad regime for the August 21 attack.</p>\n<p>In addition to the intelligence pertaining to the regime\xe2\x80\x99s preparations for the attack and our post-attack observations, it is common sense that the opposition does not have the capabilities to have carried out such a large-scale coordinated rocket and artillery attack from a regime-held neighborhood, targeting opposition neighborhoods.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth also pointing out that there\xe2\x80\x99s a great irony in the placement of an op-ed like this because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition in this country of freedom of expression, and that is not a tradition shared in Russia, by Russia.\xc2\xa0 And it is fact freedom of expression has been on the decrease over the past dozen or so years in Russia.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the point I made at the top is the most important point.\xc2\xa0 Russia, as we saw just now in Geneva, has put its prestige and credibility on the line in backing this proposal to have Syria, the Assad regime, give up the chemical weapons that until two days ago it claimed it did not have, turn them over to international supervision with the purpose of eventually destroying them.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to work with the Russians to see if this diplomatic avenue to resolving this problem can bear fruit.\xc2\xa0 And that is absolutely worthwhile and the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, Secretary Kerry just spoke.\xc2\xa0 These talks that he\xe2\x80\x99s conducting in Geneva are occurring on the same day that there are reports of increased U.S. military assistance to the opposition forces.\xc2\xa0 Do those two tracks kind of cancel each other out?\xc2\xa0 Is there a chance that that additional military support actually undermines the diplomatic track that Secretary Kerry is pursuing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without confirming specific reports, we have said for quite some time -- the President on down has said that we have been stepping up our assistance to the Syrian military opposition; no question.\xc2\xa0 And in June, the administration announced that following credible evidence that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against the Syrian people -- this is prior to the massive attack on August 21st -- the President had authorized the expansion of our assistance to the Supreme Military Council in Syria -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s military arm.</p>\n<p>The expansion of assistance has been aimed at strengthening the cohesion of the opposition and the effectiveness of the SMC on the ground, as well as assisting their efforts to defend themselves against a regime that has shown no boundaries in its willingness to kill civilians.</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important distinction to make, as we have all along, in the wake of the August 21 attacks and in our response to them, that the issue of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons is distinctly problematic and is separate from -- although it is part of the civil war, it is separate from our policy response to the civil war in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that response is built around humanitarian support for the Syrian people; assistance to the opposition, including assistance to the Supreme Military Council; as well as an effort with a broad range of allies and partners, including Russia, to bring about a resolution of that civil war through a political settlement -- because that is the only way to end that war.</p>\n<p>So these are distinct tracks.\xc2\xa0 The problem that confronts us by the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons needs to be addressed, and we are addressing that.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken clearly about his views on it.\xc2\xa0 We are exploring this diplomatic avenue, this opportunity that exists potentially to resolve this by removing from Assad\xe2\x80\x99s possession chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 But we will continue our policy of supporting the opposition in an effort to bring about a political settlement in the Syrian conflict.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the budget, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t belabor the point because you addressed it a little bit yesterday, but the House leadership is still trying to find a way to get a continuing resolution that funds the government beyond October 1st through the House.\xc2\xa0 They wanted to do it yesterday and pulled it.\xc2\xa0 And the Obamacare question aside, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering does the White House support continuing spending levels at 2013 sequester levels?\xc2\xa0 I think the number is something at the rate of $986 billion over the year.\xc2\xa0 Is that a number that the White House is satisfied with and would tell Democrats to accept if that\'s what the continuing resolution --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me step back a little bit and explain our position on this.\xc2\xa0 First of all -- and this pertains to legislation that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen, but is clearly under discussion -- we will not accept anything that delays or defunds Obamacare. Congress needs to pass a budget and not attach politically motivated riders to their funding bills -- part of a persistent effort to refight old battles to overcome the fact that this is a law that was passed by Congress, signed by the President and upheld by the Supreme Court; a law that has already provided enormous benefits and savings to millions and millions of Americans, and that will, when fully implemented, allow for millions of Americans who could not afford insurance in the past to be insured, for millions of Americans who have preexisting conditions to have the security of health insurance that they did not have in the past.\xc2\xa0 These are significant benefits that are provided by this law passed by Congress, signed by the President, upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we will not accept anything that further cuts the investments we need to grow our economy, create jobs and strengthen the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We will not, absolutely, accept the Republican budget approach that further slashes these investments in our economy and the American families need.</p>\n<p>The Republican leadership has said that -- at the very least, setting aside all the policy significance of these decisions, the Republican leadership itself has said that it would be politically damaging to them to allow the government to shut down.\xc2\xa0 And we agree; they should not do it.\xc2\xa0 And they should not do it for a host of reasons.\xc2\xa0 So Congress needs to act on this.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to how that plays itself out, we want Congress to responsibly fund government.\xc2\xa0 We have drawn the lines that we\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn, and we will see what they produce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are current spending levels something that you would accept?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, when you\'re talking about short-term extensions, we would consider a clean CR that prevents a shutdown and allows time for Congress to find a long-term solution to its budget challenges when it comes to avoiding a shutdown, but there are bigger issues that need to be resolved here, as we all know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today President Assad said that his government will wait for a month after it joins the Chemical Weapons Convention before handing over information or data about its chemical weapons stockpiles.\xc2\xa0 Is this an acceptable timeline?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to what Secretary Kerry said about this.\xc2\xa0 He outranks me.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that this needs to be done very quickly.\xc2\xa0 And words don\'t count when it comes to the Assad regime; actions count.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Assad regime in the past has committed itself to a U.N. investigation into the use of chemical weapons, and for months and months and months refused to allow inspectors in.\xc2\xa0 Even in the wake of the appalling August 21st attacks, having said that they would allow inspectors in, they waited five days before they let those inspectors in and then shot up their convoy on the way in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, action is what matters here.\xc2\xa0 And delays are not something that we can accept.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, today General Idriss said his opposition forces have not received any military support/weapons support from the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I know there have been reports that you don\'t want to confirm to the contrary.\xc2\xa0 But can you help clear this up?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So you want me to confirm the counter-contrary?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But has the United States sent the support?\xc2\xa0 Is it on its way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\'s what I can tell you.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned in answer to a previous question, in June the administration announced that following credible evidence that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against the Syrian people the President had authorized the expansion of our assistance to the Syrian Military Council.\xc2\xa0 The expansion of assistance has been aimed at strengthening the cohesion of the opposition and the effectiveness of the SMC on the ground, and their efforts to defend themselves against a repressive regime that has shown no boundaries in its willingness to kill civilians.</p>\n<p>We cannot detail every single type of support that we are providing to the opposition or discuss timelines for delivery.\xc2\xa0 But it is important to note that both the political and the military opposition are, and will be, receiving this assistance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it concern you that he is out here saying we haven\'t got any?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s important to note that both the political and the military opposition are, and will be, receiving this assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were just saying that you want this done quickly.\xc2\xa0 Why not set a timeline so you can hold their feet to the fire?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are in the process of meeting with the Russians in Geneva -- not just Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov, but also substantial teams with a great deal of technical expertise -- to work on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And I will leave it to them to discuss and explain all of the technical and logistical aspects that would be involved in securing Assad\'s -- identifying and securing Assad\'s chemical weapons stockpiles.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The objective there is to have a serious discussion about the mechanics of identifying, verifying, securing and ultimately destroying Assad\'s chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And concurrently with that process in Geneva, there is a process underway in New York at the United Nations Security Council where we are working very closely with our allies, very close allies, the United Kingdom and France, on this effort and a United Nations Security Council resolution that would be part of it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\'re also working with the Russians and the Chinese on that effort.</p>\n<p>So these teams in New York and Geneva will be better able to talk about how this will work if it is agreed to and what times and durations would be a part of an agreement.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not at an agreement yet.\xc2\xa0 And, as I said yesterday, we\'re approaching this with open eyes.\xc2\xa0 We understand that -- and it\'s important for everybody to remember where we are now.\xc2\xa0 Three weeks ago, U.N. inspectors were stymied in Syria; Syria would not admit that it possessed chemical weapons; and we had two years of complete lack of cooperation with Russia on the United Nations Security Council when it came to dealing with Syria.\xc2\xa0 Even on resolutions and initiatives that contained no element of force, simply holding Assad accountable for what he was doing to his own people -- those efforts, those resolutions were blocked by the Russians and the Chinese.</p>\n<p>Three weeks later -- three weeks later -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there have been some curves in the road as we\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived to where we are now.\xc2\xa0 But three weeks later, United Nations inspectors not only have inspected the sites that were bombed with chemical weapons on August 21st, but they will be releasing a report about that inspection.\xc2\xa0 Syria, which as recently as three days ago was denying it had chemical weapons, has admitted that it has chemical weapons, has said that it will transfer them to international control and that it is prepared to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention.\xc2\xa0 And Russia is putting its credibility on the line behind a proposal to place Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons under international control.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of distance traveled in a very short period of time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s significant to note that even as we concede upfront that this diplomatic road may or may not prove successful.\xc2\xa0 But it is absolutely worth exploring.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed in The New York Times, he says in that op-ed that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have every reason to believe that opposition forces used chemical weapons.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How do you negotiate with somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even agree with you on the facts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an inherent contradiction in the fact that Russia has acknowledged, and I assume prodded Syria into acknowledging, that Assad has these chemical weapon stockpiles; has put forward a proposal that we are glad to see that Syria -- the Assad regime give up its chemical weapons stockpile, that they be played under international control and ultimately destroyed, on the one hand -- and this is all in the wake of the August 21st attacks -- and on the other is making a claim unsupported by any shred of evidence that the opposition could be responsible for those attacks.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of logic that connects those two assertions.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that Putin would say that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily an issue in securing and disposing of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons stockpile.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an issue of a claim in its relationship to the truth and to the facts, but that\xe2\x80\x99s one for others to resolve.\xc2\xa0 And I think it goes to sort of the general differences that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had on this matter. But it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not an obstacle in our view to pursuing this diplomatic avenue.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that if there were evidence to support that assertion, The New York Times would have provided a little more space to include it in that article.\xc2\xa0 But there is no evidence.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because there also is no logic to the assertion that the opposition that did not have the capability to do this, did not have the weapons to do it, could not have in any imaginable scenario gone to regime-controlled areas of Damascus to fire rockets into opposition-controlled areas or contested areas.\xc2\xa0 It defies logic and probability.</p>\n<p>But having said that, the most important part of this is the fact that Russia has put its credibility on the line in pursuing this with us and others.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an important objective and we are very pleased to see it, and we are working -- as you saw, Secretary Kerry with his counterpart -- very closely and collaboratively with the Russians to try to see if we can get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And very quickly, just to follow up on that -- you and the President and others have said this week, \xe2\x80\x9ctrust but verify.\xe2\x80\x9d The phrase \xe2\x80\x9ctrust but verify\xe2\x80\x9d has been thrown around Washington a lot this week.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama trust President Putin?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the point of that is that actions speak louder than words, and that we will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the -- the fact is if we can resolve this without resorting to military force, if we can relieve a dictator of his stockpiles of chemical weapons so that he can never use them against innocent civilians again, then credit will be due to the Russians and to everyone else who participates in that process to make it happen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if it happens.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just first a quick clarification.\xc2\xa0 You said that the Iranians have blamed the Syrian government --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The former President of Iran acknowledged that the Syrian government was responsible for that attack.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so then the current -- the government of Iran has not made that -- okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, first of all, your reaction to the fact that the very rebels that the United States is supporting have issued a statement saying that they categorically reject the Russian initiative.\xc2\xa0 These are our allies --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that, but it goes to the point that we have been making that there is an ongoing sectarian civil war in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We have been appalled by, as many of our allies and partners have been, by the wholesale and brutal assault that Assad has waged against his own people.\xc2\xa0 But the President has made clear that even as we step up assistance to the Syrian people and we step up direct assistance to the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s Military Council, that we are not putting boots on the ground and we are not engaging militarily in an effort to take sides, to try to resolve someone else\xe2\x80\x99s civil war.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to chemical weapons, which pose a threat to the region and the world, including the United States, and the violation of a century-old prohibition against their use, we absolutely believe that we have to take action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to directly respond to the rebel groups that the United States is supporting saying that the United States is essentially selling them out by going forward with this Russian proposal.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My response to that is that we continue to support the opposition, and we are supporting the opposition in tangible ways through substantial and stepped-up assistance.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to how we resolve the disposition of these very dangerous weapons and how we ensure that a dictator does not use them again against innocent civilians, including children, we will pursue a diplomatic course to see if it can bear fruit, to see if it can produce the result that we desire.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, as the President has said, we remain ready and our military remains ready to engage in a military strike if necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can you expect the Russians to be operating in good faith on this when even this morning in The New York Times Vladimir Putin is saying it was the rebels that used the chemical weapons?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just answered this, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, not really.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t hear a direct answer to this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said that what Russia has committed itself to and put its credibility and prestige on the line in doing so is the proposition that it supports and will help bring about the removal from Assad\xe2\x80\x99s control of a substantial stockpile of chemical weapons, the transference of that stockpile to international control for the ultimate destruction of that stockpile.\xc2\xa0 That is a significant piece of business and it would represent a significant accomplishment by the international community and by Russia.\xc2\xa0 So we will pursue that.</p>\n<p>We obviously disagree with the wholly unsupported assertion that the opposition could have or did commit this atrocity.\xc2\xa0 And we have a substantial body of facts to prove our point, and we have more than 30 countries that have already agreed to that proposition.\xc2\xa0 And we have obviously -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s not a member of Congress who disagrees with us on the basic facts, which is that the chemical weapons attack occurred and Assad was responsible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you explain how, if you have an agreement with Assad to turn over his weapons and that starts to happen with the Russians -- under Russian supervision, do you still support rebel groups that are fighting to overthrow the government that you are working with to turn over their chemical weapons?\xc2\xa0 How does that work?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will continue to support the opposition because --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even as you\xe2\x80\x99re working with the government to turn over their weapons, you\'re going to support their --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are working to secure chemical weapons that need to be secured to prevent a dictator from using them again against his own people, and he has shown himself more than willing to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last.\xc2\xa0 Is it still U.S. policy that Assad must go?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is still our policy and our view that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future cannot have Assad in the picture.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s inconceivable, given what he has done to his own people.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that we have said all along needs to be decided in a political settlement.\xc2\xa0 It is not something that will be decided militarily.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you promise to come back, I defer to my colleagues behind me.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major Garrett gets some credit there.\xc2\xa0 Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have a quick question.\xc2\xa0 Diplomats always choose their words carefully, and today Kerry said, \xe2\x80\x9cshould diplomacy fail, force might be necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Everything that the President has said up until now made it seem like if diplomacy fails, force will be necessary, and that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get Congress to authorize him to do.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, you saw a sustained debate here in the United States about the use of force.\xc2\xa0 You saw the President speak about it on numerous occasions.\xc2\xa0 I think the formulation Secretary Kerry uses is allowing that -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last few weeks, there are always developments that we can\'t anticipate.\xc2\xa0 What he is saying -- and let me be clear -- is that we retain the option of using a military strike in response to Assad\xe2\x80\x99s attack with chemical weapons on his own people -- the murder of more than 1,400 Syrians, including more than 400 children -- because of the profound ramifications of not holding Assad accountable for the use of chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we are pursuing this potential diplomatic path to resolving this problem by seeing if we can prevent Assad from using chemical weapons again by relieving him of his chemical weapons without the use of force.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical that if diplomacy fails, you don\'t know whether force is going to be necessary or not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because he didn\'t say it hypothetically.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He said \xe2\x80\x9cmight.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I think that that allows for a variety of things that could happen in the next days and weeks with regard to this matter.\xc2\xa0 I think we have seen even this week that this situation is fairly fluid.\xc2\xa0 What is clear from what Secretary Kerry said and what I am saying here in the White House and what the President said the other day to the American people is that he believes absent a diplomatic success here that a military option is important to maintain, and that it is the mere pressure, it is the credible threat of military force that has resulted in these rather remarkable changes in position that we\'ve seen this week.\xc2\xa0 And we need to maintain the pressure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think I said April.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in reading this op-ed to the American people what were the messages that you got out of this op-ed from Putin?\xc2\xa0 And also, could you tell us about the message that that hand was in when --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The hand, the picture of the hand in the article -- the op-ed rather from Putin.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw it online.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the definition of the hand.\xc2\xa0 In looking up the hand on that article it meant terrorism, and also it was a signal about World War I.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I confess, April, I\'m not sure what you\'re referring to, because I just read the text.\xc2\xa0 And our response is what I said, which is the single most important thing about it is the continued assertion by the President of Russia as well as his foreign minister that Russia believes and will support and pursue this effort to secure Assad\'s chemical weapons, place them under international supervision with the ultimate goal of seeing them destroyed.\xc2\xa0 And that is a very important, significant development.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we have to work with the Russians, as well as the United Nations Security Council, to see if we can turn that proposition into reality.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russia is not alone.\xc2\xa0 China was there saying they do not want to see this to a military strike from the U.S. on Syria. With that, what are the conversations that are taking place now with the United States and China -- as the Russian situation is public, especially as the relationship with China is still complicated as well?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that you\'re absolutely right that when we have tried to bring this matter before the United Nations Security Council in the past, not just Russia but China have blocked those efforts that have been supported by a broad coalition of nations.\xc2\xa0 But it is also the case that when it comes to Syria, Russia is certainly Syria\'s premiere patron and protector.\xc2\xa0 And so we will engage with both nations.\xc2\xa0 But I think that Russia is a major player when it comes to Syria, specifically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you give us any information on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specifics on conversations in New York with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure Ambassador Power or her office might have more on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major, you want me to come back to you?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In our conversation yesterday, Jay, you said it was too early for the United States to say whether or not it would require the threat of military force to be an enforcing mechanism at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 It\'s still to be determined.\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State Kerry, in Geneva, standing next to the Russian foreign minister, added the word "might" to the idea of military action as an enforcing mechanism.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t it now fair to conclude that the threat of military action is becoming less a part of this conversation as the diplomacy moves forward?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are certainly focusing on the diplomacy right now.\xc2\xa0 The President made that clear in his address to the nation, that he asked Congress to pause in its deliberations, to postpone a vote on authorization.\xc2\xa0 But that option -- there are two aspects here.\xc2\xa0 There\'s the potential congressional vote on authorization and actions by the United States; then there\xe2\x80\x99s the potential United Nations Security Council resolution and the contents of that.\xc2\xa0 These are related but distinct enterprises.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The basic position, as the President described in this address to the nation, of the United States is that the military remains in a position to execute a plan around holding Assad accountable for his appalling use of chemical weapons against civilians.\xc2\xa0 And that remains true today.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, we are obviously focused, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s activities and the activities in New York at the United Nations, on pursuing this diplomatic option.\xc2\xa0 I think that is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly the responsible thing to explore this avenue and to see if it is possible to resolve this peacefully or diplomatically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you mentioned that you retain the ability to carry out a military strike, but as the Pentagon has noted, maintaining all of the destroyers in the Eastern Med is costly at times, and there are operational decisions that are going to have to be made in a couple, three weeks about rotations for vessels that are due back.\xc2\xa0 One of them is already two weeks overdue.\xc2\xa0 Are those factors part of the calculus as to how long this administration will wait to determine whether or not this diplomacy is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that discussed.\xc2\xa0 I think that the frame is more about testing whether or not there is seriousness here, and whether or not we can devise a plan agreed to by the relevant parties here that can bring about the transfer of those chemical weapon stockpiles to international control.\xc2\xa0 And I think that a lot depends on that process, and that would include some of what you\xe2\x80\x99re discussing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you help us understand the definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cseriousness\xe2\x80\x9d -- the benchmarks this administration has in mind when it is determining whether or not this process is serious and moving forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far a degree of seriousness about this that we have not seen before, and that is welcomed.\xc2\xa0 And having said that, actions, concrete actions speak much more loudly than --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the way forward from here.\xc2\xa0 That would be counterproductive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll know it when you see it, in other words?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think those negotiating will know it when they see it.\xc2\xa0 And I will simply say from here that this, understandably, will take some time, and there should not be an expectation, as I said yesterday, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to know everything we need to know right away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But you saw Secretary Kerry and his counterpart in Geneva discuss what they were looking forward to trying to achieve in their meetings.\xc2\xa0 And we will look for results from those meetings as we move forward and assess the level of seriousness and the commitment here to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Your goal is to remove all chemical weapons from Syria, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The goal here, as stated, is to relieve -- is to remove from Assad\xe2\x80\x99s possession chemical weapons that he has maintained.\xc2\xa0 It has been our assessment -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through this in the past -- that throughout this conflict, because of the disposition of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons stockpiles have been a concern of ours, it has been our assessment that his regime has maintained control of those stockpiles throughout the conflict.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably where you\xe2\x80\x99re going.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to people who are experts in this who spend a good deal of time analyzing not just the chemical weapons question internationally, but in Syria, and they describe our intelligence about all the possible locations as imperfect; that we may not know where everything is and we may not be able to catalogue --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, without not commenting on intelligence matters, I certainly accept that this is a relatively complicated piece of business, A; B, it is still our assessment that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s stockpiles have been in Assad\xe2\x80\x99s control throughout this conflict. So I can only point you to that.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the Assad regime, if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be cooperative in this effort, knows better than anyone where those stockpiles are and, in the process of identifying and verifying the chemical weapons, needs to be cooperative.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we, in the end, need to trust this regime?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to verify -- if this process moves forward, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to only trust, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to verify.\xc2\xa0 Verification is a key element of that process.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 How would you convince the opposition that rejected this proposal that you still intend to hold Assad accountable for gassing more than 1,000 people?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our objective -- you\xe2\x80\x99re again conflating two objectives here.\xc2\xa0 Our objective when it comes to chemical weapons use, whether through military action limited in time and duration and scope -- time and duration being the same thing -- limited in duration and scope, or through a diplomatic success here would be to prevent -- to deter Assad from using those weapons again, or, if the diplomatic initiative succeeds, preventing him from using them again by taking them all away.\xc2\xa0 So that is separate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we mean and have meant by holding him accountable for the use of those weapons.</p>\n<p>Second, when it comes to supporting the opposition, we have and will continue to provide assistance to the opposition, both humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and direct assistance to the opposition, including to the Supreme Military Council.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I quote here General Idriss; he literally accused the United States for --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just got this question, and all I can say -- you know the parameters of what I can say here and I will say it again.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that both the political and the military opposition are and will be receiving this assistance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He accused the United States for giving a pass to a criminal just for surrendering the weapon of the crime.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained our policy on numerous occasions; so has the President.\xc2\xa0 We are not sending American troops into Syria to fight somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s civil war.\xc2\xa0 We are supporting the opposition.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the use and abuse of chemical weapons, the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons against civilians, it is incumbent upon the United States and other members of the international community and all the signatories of the Chemical Weapons Convention to hold accountable the regime that used them.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in engaged in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Would you also agree that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 prestige and credibility is also on the line, not only the Russians\xe2\x80\x99, by accepting this proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would agree that the United States, in part because it is an exceptional nation, is called upon to lead in circumstances like this, often when it\'s unpopular, often when it\'s uncomfortable.\xc2\xa0 And that is what this President and this country has been doing.\xc2\xa0 And part of that is accepting that when circumstances change, as they did this week, and diplomatic avenues that had been closed reopen, that we explore them, because resolving this peacefully would be a better alternative, even as we approach this with a fair amount of skepticism and with wide-open eyes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there\'s no question that dealing with these issues is important and it\'s not always easy and it\'s not always popular either at home or abroad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To clarify on the whole rebel question, you said earlier about helping the Syrian opposition that one of the things we\'re doing is helping with cohesion on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So whose boots are on the ground helping them if we\'re helping them on the ground?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, we don\'t have boots on the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We don\'t.\xc2\xa0 So are we working with Jordanians or others?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For the fourth time in this press conference I\'m going to say that what I can say about the assistance we provide is that I cannot detail every single type of support, but that we are providing assistance to the opposition, and that it\'s important to note that both the political and the military opposition are and will be receiving this assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that assistance has been stepped up, at the President\'s direction, in the wake of the initial findings of high confidence by the United States that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against its own people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of trust with Putin, he is scheduled to meet I think on Friday with the new Iranian President.\xc2\xa0 And there are reports that Putin is offering to sell five ground-to-air missile systems to the Iranians and also is offering to build a second reactor at their nuclear plant.\xc2\xa0 Does this raise any alarm at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we continue to be focused on and engaged in the effort to have Iran forsake its nuclear weapons program and we hope that there\'s an opportunity for progress in that effort.\xc2\xa0 But it remains the case that Iran has flouted its obligations under a variety of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and we are going to work with our partners to help ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Can you react to Republican Senator Bob Corker?\xc2\xa0 Even though he is a Republican, he has worked with the President on a grand bargain, sat down for dinner with him, as I recall; has said positive things earlier in the Syria debate, and then, yesterday told CNN that he is disappointed in how the President has approached Syria, and at one point said he doesn\'t think the President is comfortable as Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to respond specifically to any individual who might have been offering an observation.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, when it comes to our approach to this problem in Syria, the President has been very clear about the need to respond and why it\'s important that Assad be held accountable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is somewhat ironic when some members of Congress are critical -- after having asked for the President to ask Congress for authorization to then be critical of that effort, which as I think everyone here reported, has involved an enormous amount of outreach, an enormous amount of information provided, both classified and unclassified, to members, as well as a very public effort to inform and educate the American people.</p>\n<p>And then, I would simply say that when it comes to being Commander-in-Chief, I think that the American people, at least in my assessment, appreciate a Commander-in-Chief who takes in new information and doesn\'t celebrate decisiveness for the sake of decisiveness.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, the President\'s objectives are clear.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that the American people would certainly support the proposition that if there\'s a diplomatic opportunity here to remove from Assad\'s control these chemical weapons stockpiles that we ought to pursue it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what he is doing.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On domestic politics, does the President or does the White House see the House decision to pull a vote on the funding as sort of raising the specter of a possible government shutdown? Are you concerned that the likelihood of that is growing in the light of the latest?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that the leaders in Congress of the Republican Party have made clear that they understand that allowing a shutdown would create an unnecessary headwind to the economy and I think cause political problems for them.\xc2\xa0 And I assume that the combination of those two incentives would compel them to come up with a solution, so that we can fund the government responsibly, and not engage in these games that inflict unnecessary wounds on our economy right when it\'s growing and creating jobs and we\'re continuing to move out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it primarily Boehner who the White House is negotiating with on budget and debt ceiling, or are there some other --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a list of engagements.\xc2\xa0 We\'re speaking obviously with a number of leaders and members in Congress on this matter.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously working with our Democratic allies on this matter in both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But again, Congress has a few basic responsibilities, and one of them is to fund the government; another is to pay the bills that it\'s incurred.\xc2\xa0 And we simply ask that Congress own those responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to put a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I do a quick foreign policy one?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you spoken with the President actually about the Putin piece?\xc2\xa0 And here\'s what I want to ask.\xc2\xa0 It just seemed that he hit on so many hot-button things that in theory would get under the President\'s skin -- not a lot of democracy, but a whole lot of al Qaeda; you\'re either with us or against us, comparing him to President Bush; there\'s no exceptionalism.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said exceptionalism from the podium like eight times now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said it once.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, like six.\xc2\xa0 Well, I lost count after five.\xc2\xa0 So does the President think that President Putin was trying to get under his skin?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The reaction that I gave you is a reaction of the White House from the President on down.\xc2\xa0 The most important thing about this is that Russia has committed itself and, in doing that, has put its prestige on the line, including the individual prestige of its President, behind this proposition that we can resolve this by having the Syrian regime, the Assad regime give up its chemical weapons stockpile to international control.\xc2\xa0 And that is important.</p>\n<p>And we hope that Russia and, through Russia, Syria keeps the commitments that they\'re making this week.\xc2\xa0 And we will work very closely with Russia in trying to bring this about.\xc2\xa0 And if it is achieved, it would be a significant accomplishment for the international community broadly and for Russia.\xc2\xa0 So we hope that these commitments are kept.</p>\n<p>Yes, Kirsten.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, but this is not the main point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s the main point?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Shocked.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the interview that Assad gave today.\xc2\xa0 He said that any agreement would require the United States to stop arming the rebel forces.\xc2\xa0 I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t get specific about the type of assistance that the U.S. is giving to rebel forces, but would the United States consider at all scaling back that assistance --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are and will continue, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said a number of times here, to support -- to provide assistance to the political and military opposition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you consider scaling it back as a part of it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate this.\xc2\xa0 But our position is that we are providing assistance to the opposition, both the military and the political opposition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that won\xe2\x80\x99t change?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And again, conditions and demands placed by someone who a few weeks ago blithely used chemical weapons against innocent children so that we could all watch them die in videos are a little hard to take.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Richard Engle, who is reporting from the region, has reported that thousands of al Qaeda members are joining with rebel forces while these diplomatic talks are going on.\xc2\xa0 Does that square with your understanding?\xc2\xa0 And how much does that complicate your efforts to assist --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have specific numbers to attach to the assertion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made for some time that there are elements of the opposition that are extremists and are not friendly to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have throughout this process worked to identify the moderate elements of the opposition and to support the moderate elements of the opposition.\xc2\xa0 But I think Secretary Kerry and others have spoken about this directly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I guess going back to that, several months ago you said you felt confident that you were able to identify who those moderate elements are.\xc2\xa0 Are you still confident about that given that there seems to be an uptick in the number of al Qaeda forces who have joined --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 We are very deliberate in the process of identifying moderate elements of the opposition for precisely this reason.</p>\n<p>Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s message is going to be on Wednesday when he speaks to the Business Roundtable?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am sure he will discuss at that meeting the efforts that we all need to engage in to help the economy continue to grow and help it grow in a way that makes the middle class more secure -- because we have always been at our strongest economically when the middle class is growing -- when the middle class is secure and expanding.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that economy and economic policies will be the focus of that discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything specific for you at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on one point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Andrei.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The main point I think in Putin\xe2\x80\x99s piece is nobody is above the law.\xc2\xa0 I personally admire it -- that he is being consistent that nobody is above the law.</p>\n<p>My question to you is very simple.\xc2\xa0 Does this principle apply internationally:\xc2\xa0 Nobody is above the international law as it stands?\xc2\xa0 Does this apply to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei, Russia blocked at the United Nations Security Council multiple resolutions to hold Assad accountable that did not even have force attached to them.\xc2\xa0 True or false?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They did it deliberately.\xc2\xa0 They did it deliberately.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because it was the law.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the law to block holding people accountable?\xc2\xa0 I think that that\'s a fine position to take, and I understand that that\'s the position the Russian government has taken, but it is not the position that we think is the right position when it comes to the agreement by 98 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population that chemical weapons ought not to be used and should be prohibited and should be banned.\xc2\xa0 And to support a regime that uses them against its own people is a terrible thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the United States above the law?\xc2\xa0 Jay, yes or no?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not even a serious question, Andrei.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the congressional picnic, can you say why that was canceled?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is a serious question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does that say anything about the state of relations between the White House and the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It does not.\xc2\xa0 The picnic was -- decisions had to be made about holding it when we thought that there was going to be an enormous amount of activity on Syria.\xc2\xa0 What we are doing is offering a change in the way that the holiday parties are constructed so that members of Congress can bring their families to those parties.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you address the question of the state of relations between the White House and the Hill going into your fall discussions and preparations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously have divided government.\xc2\xa0 We have sometimes contentious, sometimes very effective relations with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We work with Congress to get the business of the American people done.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s shutting down the government or engaging in ideological battles like threatening to default over defunding Obamacare, these are not constructive approaches to getting the business of the American people done.</p>\n<p>But we keep at it.\xc2\xa0 And we believe the American people want their elected representatives to focus on helping the economy, helping the middle class, and certainly avoiding self-inflicted wounds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So where do you think you are now on that spectrum between constructive and contentious and -- what did you say -- effective?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that as has been true ever since I got to Washington under the Clinton administration and the Bush administration, this is a contested business.\xc2\xa0 And parties hold different positions; individual lawmakers hold different positions.\xc2\xa0 Congress and the occupant of the Oval Office sometimes are at odds.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s out system and you work within the system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you say did the White House get a heads-up on this Putin op-ed from the Times before it was published?\xc2\xa0 And you haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite been clear whether the President himself has read it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve given the White House response.\xc2\xa0 The President reads widely, including The New York Times.\xc2\xa0 Our response is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the President\xe2\x80\x99s response?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the head of the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did he get any -- did he or the White House get a heads-up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any heads-up, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I didn\'t talk to everyone about it.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that op-ed, at the very end, President Putin said that over time there\xe2\x80\x99s been growing trust in his relationship with the President.\xc2\xa0 A month ago the White House canceled a visit to Moscow on the rationale that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much worth talking about with the President on a whole range of issues, not just Syria.\xc2\xa0 Would President Obama share that characterization?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what President Obama would say is that his conversations, even when we have not been able to see eye-to-eye with President Putin, have always been direct and constructive and with each President making his views clear.\xc2\xa0 And that was the case in St. Petersburg.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, one of the topics of the conversation that the two Presidents had in St. Petersburg was the possibility of pursuing a diplomatic initiative to take away from Assad his chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case that this is a conversation that had been engaged in periodically both at the presidential level and the foreign minister level over the last many months without action.\xc2\xa0 And it was a new and welcome development to see a public initiative to see if this could be achieved, and that is a good thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And look, our approach -- and this is why I think I and others have tried to answer questions about the state of the reset this way -- is that the whole point of the reset was to explore opportunities to advance each country\xe2\x80\x99s interest in our conversations with the Russians, even as we acknowledged that we would not agree on everything.\xc2\xa0 And even during the early period of the so-called reset, there were areas of serious disagreement, including on missile defense, but we were able to accomplish a number of things that were in the interest of the United States and our national security and in the interest of Russia, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why Russia pursued the reset.</p>\n<p>Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s also, as the President said, the case that we had run into a wall in our efforts to reach agreement with the Russians on other areas like Syria, like some other things, some economic things, but even in that circumstance, the fact is on some of these other issues where we have found agreement with the Russians we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to work with them.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to acknowledge that.</p>\n<p>The relationship is not all hot or all cold; it\xe2\x80\x99s one where we agree on some issues and make progress, and disagree on some others.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully where we have seen enormous disagreement on Syria, we have now found potentially an avenue of agreement, where success, if it comes -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly a long way from that at this point -- if it comes, that would represent a real breakthrough.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think canceling the Moscow stop got his attention?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the Russians.</p>\n<p>Last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got one question but it has two parts.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s fair.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the forewarning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first part being on Syria -- who is in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat now, diplomatically -- Russia or the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working directly with Russia.\xc2\xa0 John Kerry is with his Russian counterpart.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working in New York with all members of the United Nations Security Council, including the other four permanent members, one of which is Russia.\xc2\xa0 And because Assad and the Syrian regime has been a patron of Russia, protected by Russia, obviously Russia plays a huge role in bringing about this change in Syria\xe2\x80\x99s handling of its chemical weapons, and even its admittance that it has chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And that means -- that is very significant.</p>\n<p>Moving this forward requires the joint effort of the United States and Russia, and the consensus effort of nations on the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 So this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not one nation; it\xe2\x80\x99s many.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the United States and Russia are key players.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just allow me to play devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate here.\xc2\xa0 Has the United States, by accepting Putin\xe2\x80\x99s gambit here, put him in the arguably ironic position of claiming to be the peacemaker in this, which if his op-ed is any indication, would be what he apparently believes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here is what I would say -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from there and I do not, through this briefing or any other, want to convey anything but a sober assessment of the potential for success, because we are understandably skeptical -- but if we were to see a situation unfold where Assad were to give up his chemical weapons, all of them, to international supervision, that would be an enormous accomplishment and it would represent a wholesale change from where Syria and Russia were as recently as three weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And I think that would be due significantly to the decisions made by the Russian leadership, but also the decisions made by the United States, by the President to take the approach that he has taken in response to the horrifying use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime on its own people.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:55 P.M.
