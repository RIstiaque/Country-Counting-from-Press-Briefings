Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:24 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 Glad it\'s finally here.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight to your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKathleen, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to start with the administration\'s letter on transgender bathroom guidance for schools.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I thought you might.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought I\'d give you a chance to respond to Texas\'s \xe2\x80\x93 the lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, who said that the letter -- he called the letter "blackmail," and said that the administration is doing everything it can to -- or he said it\'s going to divide the country and it has everything to do with keeping the federal government out of local issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to a statewide elected office.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s just walk through the facts here.\xc2\xa0 The first is, this was guidance that was issued by the Department of Education and the Department of Justice in response to requests for information and guidance from school administrators across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJust last week, for example, the National Association of Secondary School Principals put forward a specific formal request to the Department of Education about how to create the kind of respectful, inclusive environment that school administrators across the country are seeking to maintain.\xc2\xa0 These principals also are interested in making sure that they\'re acting consistent with the law.\xc2\xa0 And they sought guidance because they\'re not interested in a political argument, they\'re actually interested in practical suggestions about how they confront this challenge that they face every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let\'s just be clear about what\'s included in the guidance.\xc2\xa0 The guidance does not add additional requirements to the applicable law.\xc2\xa0 The guidance does not require any student to use shared facilities when schools make alternate arrangements.\xc2\xa0 But what the framework does provide is advice for how school administrators can protect the dignity and safety of every student under their charge.\xc2\xa0 And that advice includes practical, tangible, real-world suggestions to school administrators who have to deal with this issue.\xc2\xa0 They can\'t rely on political arguments that are framed as a solution to a problem that nobody can prove exists.\xc2\xa0 They actually have to deal with the responsibility that they have to promote an inclusive, respectful environment for all of their students.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the Department of Education has issued today is specific, tangible, real-world advice and suggestions to school administrators across the country about exactly they can do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t argue -- or it seems as though the administration is also trying to paint this as a major civil rights issue, right?\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a pragmatic sort of everyday guidance to schools.\xc2\xa0 Attorney General Lynch has compared this to racial segregation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Attorney General Lynch was talking about a very specific enforcement action that the Department of Education announced -- or the Department of Justice announced with regard to a specific law that was passed by the state of North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 In this instance, this is not an enforcement action.\xc2\xa0 As I pointed out, this does not add any additional requirements to any school district or state under the applicable law.\xc2\xa0 This is in response to extensive requests for guidance and for information and advice that have been put forward by school administrators and teachers and, in some cases, even parents who are seeking practical solutions to this challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the challenge here is not to isolate anybody, it\'s not to discriminate against anybody, it\'s not to make anybody unsafe -- it\'s actually to ensure that our schools are as inclusive and respectful and safe as they can possibly be.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the guidance that we\'ve put forward includes tangible, specific suggestions for how that can be achieved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let me just give you one example.\xc2\xa0 There are some school districts across the country that have sought to enhance the privacy of their students by making relatively minor changes to shared-use facilities.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, that means just putting up curtains so that people have more privacy when they\'re changing their clothes or taking showers in what had previously been shared-use facilities.\xc2\xa0 So that is something that benefits all students, and that\'s what we\'re looking for -- solutions that protect the safety and dignity of every single student in the school.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if schools individually decide not to follow this guidance, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a threat that they could lose federal funding --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if there are schools -- first of all, let me just state that it is my strongly held belief -- and I\'m pretty sure I\'m going to be right about this -- that the vast majority of schools and school districts and school administrators across the country will welcome this guidance and will implement it.\xc2\xa0 For those that don\xe2\x80\x99t, there\'s an established process for them to raise any concerns that they may have.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s an established process for that, and we\'ll go through it.\xc2\xa0 But the vast majority of schools and school administrators will incorporate this advice as they confront the challenge of ensuring that they\'re promoting the kind of respectful, safe learning environment that can ensure the success of all of their students.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and I\'m going to just switch topics.\xc2\xa0 Chairman Rogers is saying he\'s put together a Zika measure -- and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t put a dollar figure amount, but it\'s safe to say it\'s going to be well under what you all have asked, even under the Senate, of $1.1 trillion [sic].\xc2\xa0 So are you willing to accept $1.1 trillion?\xc2\xa0 Is that enough money to fight Zika?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the details related to Chairman Rogers\'s proposal.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would encourage him to do before he puts it forward -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has yet -- but if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, if there\'s still time, he should consult with the public health professionals that the administration talked to in putting forward our funding request for what is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 Time\'s a-wastin\'.\xc2\xa0 And you saw that from the graphic that we presented in the briefing earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 As the weather warms up, as the mosquito population grows, the risk to pregnant women and their babies all across the country grows.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so it\'s long past time for people like Chairman Rogers, who\'s got a substantial responsibility here -- he\'s the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee -- when our public health professionals say that they need resources to protect the American people, they\'re looking exactly at Chairman Rogers to see exactly what he\'s doing.\xc2\xa0 And here we are, three months after the administration has put forward our proposal, that he comes forward with a much smaller one that is inconsistent with the recommendations of our public health professionals.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also inconsistent of the request that was put forward by Democratic and Republican governors from across the country who said that they needed urgent congressional action to provide the necessary resources to keep the American people safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo before that proposal is put forward, I would encourage the Chairman to consult with governors who are responsible for the safety of the citizens of their state and the public health professionals who have taken a look at this, and understand exactly what can be done and what should be done to ensure the safety and security of the American people, and particularly pregnant women and their babies.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s top military commander has been killed, and I\'m wondering, does the administration have any understanding of who was responsible for that, and any comment on what impact this may have on the group?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve certainly seen reports that Mustafa Badreddine was killed this week in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we noted the fact that preparations are underway for his funeral.\xc2\xa0 Badreddine was Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s top military commander.\xc2\xa0 In June of 2011, a special tribunal for Lebanon charged him with the 2005 attack that killed former Prime Minister Hariri.\xc2\xa0 In September of 2012, the United States imposed sanctions against Hezbollah leaders, including Bedreddine, in part to expose Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s support for the Assad regime and its role in conducting indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Syria and Lebanon.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve noted that the Syrian regime and Hezbollah have a long military alliance, and Hezbollah leaders have previously sought safe haven in Syria and have even routed weapons from Iran into Lebanon.\xc2\xa0 So the interplay between the Assad regime and Hezbollah has been well chronicled.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ve seen the reports of his death.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t independently confirm them.\xc2\xa0 And I guess the thing that I can confirm is that there were no U.S. or coalition aircraft in the area where he was reported to be killed.\xc2\xa0 But I can\'t further confirm the reports.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to what impact the U.S. feels this will have on the group and its activities?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we know that the Assad regime relied heavily on Hezbollah for military support in the ongoing chaos inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 The Assad regime, and President Assad himself, has personally benefitted from the activities that Hezbollah has carried out, so it\'s hard for me to draw any firm conclusions about what operational impact this would have.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the concerns that we\'ve previously expressed about Hezbollah I think are consistent with our ongoing efforts to reduce the violence inside of Syria and get all of the parties, including the Assad regime, to abide by the ceasefire.\xc2\xa0 Those are our priorities because we want to try to bring about a political solution to the chaos inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the school bathroom issue, how concerned is the administration about the legal challenges?\xc2\xa0 The Texas attorney general is saying that this oversteps the administration\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority.\xc2\xa0 And can you speak to -- I mean, you said very clearly to Kathleen that you expect the vast majority of schools will implement the guidance.\xc2\xa0 But for those that don\'t, what happens with them?\xc2\xa0 Is the administration actively going to follow up with them and punish them in some way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s an established process for schools and the Department of Education to discuss guidance that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been provided.\xc2\xa0 I just want to reiterate -- and this is important for people who are interested in the legal aspect of this -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no additional requirement under the applicable law that\xe2\x80\x99s being imposed on schools.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just not, despite the claims of political opponents of the administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a strong desire on the part of some politicians to try and score some cheap political points by presenting a solution to a problem that they can\'t prove exists.\xc2\xa0 And what the administration has tried to do is to provide, at the request of school administrators, practical, real-world advice they can use in their school communities to address this challenge.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the practical offering that we have put forward here.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s a lot different than the argument that others are making.\xc2\xa0 For example, is the Texas attorney general suggesting somehow that it would be practical to station a law enforcement officer outside of every public bathroom in an educational facility and check people\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificates on the way in?\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like a practical application to me.\xc2\xa0 It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like small government to me.\xc2\xa0 It certainly sounds like a government intrusion to me.\xc2\xa0 But, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s hard to sift through in all of this.\xc2\xa0 What exactly is the practical argument or suggestion that they\xe2\x80\x99re making?</p>\n<p>\n\tI recognize that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got some sharp political arguments that were honed over years of morning drive-time radio in Houston, but school administrators don\xe2\x80\x99t have the benefit of just talking.\xc2\xa0 They actually have a functional responsibility to protect the safety and dignity of every student at their school.\xc2\xa0 And the vast majority of school administrators take that responsibility quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome and implement the guidance that\xe2\x80\x99s been issued by the Department of Education today.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll move around.\xc2\xa0 Gregory.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of times when a guidance or regulation or directive comes from a federal agency, it\xe2\x80\x99s portrayed as a White House action.\xc2\xa0 Could you address what this transgender bathroom issue -- did this come from the White House?\xc2\xa0 Was the White House consulted?\xc2\xa0 How unitary is the unitary executive on things like this?\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, is the White House and the Obama administration synonymous, for all intents and purposes, to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Putting forward guidance like this is the responsibility of the Department of Education.\xc2\xa0 And they have to consider a broad range of policy implications for schools all across the country.\xc2\xa0 So this is the responsibility of the Department of Education, but you would expect the White House to be responsible for coordinating policy decisions that are made by agencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo of course the White House was aware of the policy deliberations that have been underway at the Department of Education for quite some time, but ultimately this is the responsibility and the function of the Department of Education, and they are the ones who received requests from schools all across the country, and they are the ones who are putting forward guidance for how schools can deal with this particular situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the rationale that the administration has come to, to base this guidance on Title IX, just to be clear about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be overruled by an attorney at the Department of Justice or the Department of Education that you can consult after this hearing -- or after this briefing, but let me try.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMy understanding is that Title IX applies specifically to preventing sex discrimination in educational institutions.\xc2\xa0 And the idea that individuals are discriminated against because of their gender identity is the basis for the guidance that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting forward.\xc2\xa0 Nobody should be discriminated against because of who they are.\xc2\xa0 And our suggestion is that the rules should apply to everybody equally, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the basis of this guidance -- that every student should have access to facilities that every other student has access to.\xc2\xa0 No one should be discriminated against because of who they are.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the basis for this guidance.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s also why we say no student is forced to use shared facilities.\xc2\xa0 And if there are alternate facilities available, that are made available by administrators, then every student should have access to those as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t local communities be making these very intimate decisions?\xc2\xa0 How does the federal government know what\xe2\x80\x99s best in so many different communities where there are different cultural sensitivities?\xc2\xa0 Why is this not a local matter?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is a local matter.\xc2\xa0 That is exactly the position of the Obama administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why is the federal government involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The federal government is providing specific suggestions based on examples that we\xe2\x80\x99ve collected from across the country.\xc2\xa0 And the guidance is presented -- it is not an additional requirement under the applicable law.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide any obligation to a student, for example, to use a shared facility.\xc2\xa0 Rather, what it does is we have consulted with schools all across the country and surfaced good suggestions, good examples -- in some cases, even best practices -- for addressing this situation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of guidance that\xe2\x80\x99s at the essence of the coordinating role that the Department of Education plays.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, Ron, there\xe2\x80\x99s a long history in our country of the federal government playing a very important role in ensuring that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t discriminated against.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the health care law and the new rule, what\xe2\x80\x99s different?\xc2\xa0 How does this apply to the transgender community specifically now?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s different?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So this is a good example of what I was just talking about.\xc2\xa0 There is a new rule that is part of the Affordable Care Act, or the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, gender identity, age or disability, and it ensures that individuals with limited English proficiency can access language assistance when they\xe2\x80\x99re seeking health care.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, a basic responsibility of the federal government -- and this has been true throughout our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history -- is ensuring that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t discriminated against.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly true when it comes to health care as well.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true of any potential sex discrimination, but that also is relevant to discrimination that could be targeted at people because of their race, because of a perceived disability, because somebody is pregnant, because somebody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak English very well.\xc2\xa0 We believe people should be treated the same and afforded the same kind of opportunities, regardless of these specific individual characteristics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the mention of transgender patients -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t that specific?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that new?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that different?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out is a new part of the rule that\xe2\x80\x99s been issued today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the harm, in terms of the transgender community?\xc2\xa0 Was there some identifiable problem out there that required this clarification or this augmentation to the rule?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Ron, this is much broader than just applying to the transgender community.\xc2\xa0 But the transgender community is included.\xc2\xa0 In the same way that we want to prevent discrimination against pregnant women, we want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re preventing discrimination against transgendered women.\xc2\xa0 In the same way that we\xe2\x80\x99re preventing discrimination against people who don\xe2\x80\x99t speak English very well or people who have a specific disability, we want to make sure that transgendered men are not discriminated against either.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically because there\xe2\x80\x99s some concern in that community about access to transition drugs and medications and services, was that something that the administration was concerned about in terms of trying to, I guess you could say, refine this rule?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess in terms of the way that it has an impact on individual health care decisions, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Health and Human Services for answering that question.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the idea behind this specific rule is to prevent discrimination against a wide range of groups.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other area.\xc2\xa0 There are these reports about immigration raids that are supposedly happening during May.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard even Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders comment on this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the belief that the administration is going to conduct huge raids during May and June, rallying up significant numbers of women and children, recent people who have crossed the country in significant numbers.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 Is there something different happening now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is an excellent question.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a DHS enforcement action, so there are some limitations about what I can say, but let me help you understand exactly the policy that DHS is implementing.\xc2\xa0 And I think I can largely answer your question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is -- and this is something that Secretary Johnson himself has said -- that the operations that are underway are merely the continuation of operations that were announced in January and in March.\xc2\xa0 And those operations are conducted under the rubric of the guidance that President Obama and Secretary Johnson put in place in November of 2014.\xc2\xa0 And that is guidance that made a priority of individuals who are convicted criminals or otherwise a threat to public safety, or individuals who were apprehended after crossing the border after January 1st of 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that our priorities are people who pose a threat to the community, people who are convicted criminals, or people who have only recently crossed the border.\xc2\xa0 So those priorities remain in place, and those priorities are followed even as these operations continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me say two more things.\xc2\xa0 The first is, no one is removed if they have an ongoing, pending claim or appeal for asylum or some other form of humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0 People are given access to due process.\xc2\xa0 And that is a foundational principle for all of this.\xc2\xa0 So the only people who are the targets of these operations are people who are subject to an order by an immigration court for removal and people who have also, in addition to being subject to that order, have exhausted any potential claims that they have for humanitarian relief.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing is DHS enforcement agents also follow what I understand is to be longstanding guidance that ensures that these operations are not conducted in sensitive places.\xc2\xa0 These operations are not conducted in schools or hospitals or places of worship, for example.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there no reason to fear that the numbers of deportations aren\'t going to increase or spike -- whatever words you want to use now -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s something, a specific operation underway that\xe2\x80\x99s different from what\xe2\x80\x99s normally happening there along the border?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what Secretary Johnson has described is that the operations that are underway now are a continuation of operations that were previously announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, I think we would anticipate that the deportation numbers would continue to go up.\xc2\xa0 This administration is serious about enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that our political opponents don\'t like to acknowledge that fact.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve made clear how we\'re going to use law enforcement resources to enhance or border security and to enhance the security of communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 Most importantly, we\'re going to enforce our laws.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is something that President Obama is committed to.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is, we would have a whole lot more resources to do exactly that if Republicans in the House of Representatives had not blocked comprehensive immigration reform legislation that did include an historic investment in our border security.\xc2\xa0 But we do not enjoy the benefits of that border security today because House Republicans blocked the passage of that legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not your political opponents -- well, some of the people who are objecting to this or raising concerns about this are Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, who I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d consider political opponents.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, but it\xe2\x80\x99s our political opponents who suggest that President Obama is not interested in enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is demonstrably false.\xc2\xa0 That\'s that point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason that we\'re having this conversation right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnita.\xc2\xa0 Oh, Leslie, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 She was here yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She was.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you, Leslie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s fine, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I had a couple questions on the gender guidelines you sent out last night.\xc2\xa0 Given that North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s House Bill 2, that\'s sort of part of this, is headed to the courts, why did the White House feel the need to put out this directive to the law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a directive that is responsive to requests that we\'ve received all across the country from school administrators and teachers and parents and others.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a response to the ongoing legal dispute related to HB2.\xc2\xa0 This is a response to requests that the Department of Education has received from teachers and administrators all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve cautioned before about being careful of not putting your finger on the scale.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t this sort of suggest that you\'re putting the White House\xe2\x80\x99s finger on the scale?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve been quite clear about the need to keep enforcement actions separate from any sort of political interference.\xc2\xa0 This is not an enforcement action.\xc2\xa0 This is a policy decision that was made by the Department of Education.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, the White House was appropriately involved in coordinating that policy decision.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the Department of Education to make this policy decision and to communicate it to the schools and administrators all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tNotably, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an enforcement action.\xc2\xa0 It does not add a requirement to the applicable law.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\'t pose any requirements on students for the use of shared facilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the other questions I had for you.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned -- you were asked about the lieutenant governor\xe2\x80\x99s comments on it, and you said that it runs the risk -- or it underscores the risk of electing a right-wing radio host.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To statewide office, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, to statewide office.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the White House last year when the Supreme Court ruled on same-sex marriage, the White House put the lights out on the fountain, how much of this was a political consideration in doing these guidelines?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as I pointed out before, the guidelines contain practical advice and suggestions for school administrators across the country that have to deal with this challenge inside their communities.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of relying on political arguments that are an attempt to try to score some political points that propose to address a solution to a problem that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually exist.\xc2\xa0 These are school administrators who are trying to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 They\'re trying to promote an atmosphere of dignity and security for the students and their schools.\xc2\xa0 And so what the Department of Education has put forward are practical suggestions for how exactly they can do that consistent with civil rights law.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the White House is not looking to score any political points on it, even though it\'s been hailed by a number of organizations as a new frontier in same-sex law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not surprised to hear that there are people who agree that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t discriminate against people because of who they are.\xc2\xa0 I think most Americans agree with that notion.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s part of why I anticipate that school administrators across the country would welcome this guidance.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I\'ll also say, I think school administrators across the country who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the politics of this administration will also welcome these suggestions, because they recognize that they have a challenge that they have to deal with and that, frankly, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of engaging in a partisan political argument with a right-wing radio host.\xc2\xa0 In fact, what they have to do is they have to provide for the safety and dignity of the students who are under their care.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what this guidance does, is it gives them some useful tools for considering a range of options that they can use to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this has very little to do with politics, except for our critics who want to make this entirely about politics.\xc2\xa0 This administration is interested in providing workable, practical solutions to school administrators who are trying to provide for the safety and dignity of the students under their care.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, Leslie.\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is it the intention of the administration that the guidance letter be seen as a threat to deny federal funds to school districts that don\xe2\x80\x99t comply with the policy decisions as interpreted by DOE and DOJ?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, they should not view it that way.\xc2\xa0 They should view this as guidance, as specific suggestions and a framework for dealing with a very straightforward challenge:\xc2\xa0 How do school administrators, all across the country, ensure that they\'re protecting both the safety and dignity of every single student at the school.\xc2\xa0 It\'s as simple as that.\xc2\xa0 And what the Department of Education has done is they\'ve drawn on their own internal expertise, and they\'ve drawn on the creative solutions that have been implemented by school administrators all across the country to put all that good information in one place and provide some practical advice to school administrators who are trying to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what is true, what is undeniably true is the foundation of this guidance is the principle that people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be discriminated against just because of who they are.\xc2\xa0 And school administrators don\xe2\x80\x99t have a glamorous job.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who, I think in most cases, feel quite passionate about their work.\xc2\xa0 They view their work as a calling.\xc2\xa0 They\'re looking to prepare the next generation of Americans to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And they want to create a learning environment where every student can feel safe, where every student can feel included, where every student can feel respected.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the vast majority of school administrators are interested in, and that\'s why I think the vast majority of school administrators are going to use this guidance, they\'re going to carefully consider the suggestions that have been put forward by the Department of Education, and they\'re going to put forward a solution that works in their community.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way this should work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you see how some might see the guidance letter as an implied threat of loss of federal funds, being that you mentioned that under the provisions of Title IX, schools that receive federal funds are obligated to comply with the provisions that are stated forth in the guidance letter?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, there is a desire in the guidance to be as clear as possible about why this guidance is being issued.\xc2\xa0 But look, it\'s quite clear what we\'re interested in here.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Education is interested in providing guidance and suggestions to school administrators who are trying to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 And that right thing is to prevent people from being discriminated against, but also make sure that every single student in their school has their safety and their dignity protected.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue -- do you have any further guidance on the WASPs legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0 This is the bill about the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Women Airforce Service Pilots.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the World War II women Airforce veterans -- pilots.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that we have received that from Congress yet.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we\'ve got an update on that.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll be tracking that, and we\'ll keep you posted on that status.\xc2\xa0 But the President does intend to sign it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And you said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Do you know why the President could not have, as Commander-in-Chief, directed the Army to allow a burial for these women at Arlington without legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly how the law works.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if his authority as Commander-in-Chief could have been used for that purpose.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly welcomed the bipartisan legislation from Congress that would make the use of that -- or the exercise of that authority unnecessary, because Congress has passed a law making it possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Everyone is in my business today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everyone is in my business today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know, man.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You got to elbow those people out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you said that there was a determination, as a result of multiagency review, that there would be no loss of federal funds at this time to North Carolina as a result of possible suit.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, this guidance on transgender students is issued.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that sending a mixed message?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s a mixed message.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important for people to understand what\'s happening here.\xc2\xa0 This guidance that was put forward by the Department of Education does not impose any new requirements under the applicable law.\xc2\xa0 It\'s guidance that\'s issued to school administrators in school districts all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe conversation that we\'ve been having over the course of this week has largely been centered on the state of North Carolina and what impact their law could have on their compliance with the Civil Rights Act.\xc2\xa0 So it was related to a specific piece of legislation that was passed almost literally in the dark of night by the legislation that convened a one-day special session to pass this bill.\xc2\xa0 It was signed the same day by the governor.\xc2\xa0 And the rebuke from business leaders in North Carolina and business leaders who are contemplating doing business in North Carolina has been forceful.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s an indication that the legislation that was passed by the state legislature was much more -- was much broader than just something that would apply in an educational setting.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the situations are quite different.\xc2\xa0 I think they do illustrate how consistent and forceful this administration has been about fighting against the idea that people could be discriminated against because of who they are.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a principle the President does feel strongly about.\xc2\xa0 It\'s obviously a principle that Attorney General Lynch spoke movingly about.\xc2\xa0 And preventing discrimination and treating people fairly is a core principle that does guide a lot of the policy that\'s made by the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 But the enforcement action that was announced by the Attorney General this week was enforcement action that was the decision of attorneys at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 That decision was not influenced by White House officials.\xc2\xa0 The notification that was distributed by the Department of Education today is not an enforcement action; it was a policy decision that did include some White House involvement, but was the realm and responsibility of the Department of Education.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But nonetheless, given that the major component of House Bill 2 is that transgender students in North Carolina are prohibited from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that necessarily mean that even if schools not to follow this guidance that the Department of Education has put out, that they will not suffer a loss of federal funds?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what this says is -- well, the way this works is that if there are schools -- and I think they will be in the minority -- but if there are schools across the country that do come forward and indicate that they do not intend to be in compliance with this guidance, then there is an established process for litigating those differences with the Department of Education.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s an established process for this.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to invent one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was it planned to make the announcement that there would be no loss of federal funds for North Carolina at this time, in conjunction with the announcement from the Department of Education and Justice for this guidance for transgender students?\xc2\xa0 Was that coincidental?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, these were separate actions.\xc2\xa0 So, again, as it relates to North Carolina in consideration of HB2, the policy decision that was made, even as agencies were considering whether or not the passage and implementation of HB2 would put a range of federally funded programs at risk in the state of North Carolina, the decision that was made was to not withhold any funding until the enforcement action that was announced by the Department of Justice had made its way through the courts.\xc2\xa0 So that was a very specific thing, and that was a response to developments that occurred this week with regard to the situation in North Carolina.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis guidance is guidance that has been in the works for years, but it is guidance that is broadly consistent with the kinds of principles that this President and this administration has long fought for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 Even after you said yesterday, with regard to HB2, that there would be no loss of federal funds to the state as the enforcement action is ongoing in the courts, a Department of Education spokesperson said the review there is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Do you know why the spokesperson would have said that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But this is a little complicated, so it may have just been a bit of a miscommunication.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates specifically to HB2, no federal agencies will be making a decision to withhold funding as a result of HB2 until the DOJ enforcement process has worked its way through the courts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is this the extent of guidance like this?\xc2\xa0 Or do you foresee similar directives to come from the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not aware of any other -- I mean, when you say "like this," you mean guidance that could have an impact on --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you said that you had received inquiries from the educational community, that you\'re responding to it.\xc2\xa0 Have you received inquiries from other industries, companies, elsewhere, also demanding this kind of clarity on how they should be treating transgender people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any guidance that\'s likely to attract the amount of interest that this one has.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to go back to an idea you were talking about here with Kathleen.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify:\xc2\xa0 Does the President see this as a clear-cut civil rights issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there obviously is a question of civil rights here.\xc2\xa0 And there is a question of how can we ensure that the civil rights of every student is protected.\xc2\xa0 There\'s also a question of how do we ensure that the dignity and safety of every student is protected.\xc2\xa0 And the guidance that we have put forward would do both.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that\'s why we\'re going to see a lot of school administrators come forward and announce their intent to implement this guidance, or they\'re going just going to implement the guidance without announcing it.\xc2\xa0 Or, like many school administrators, they\'re already doing this kind of work to ensure the safety and dignity of every student at the school.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is the thing that I was mentioning before.\xc2\xa0 This is something that over the last week or two has been a pretty loud part of the political debate.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that school administrators all across the country have been dealing with for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 So they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of falling back on talking points.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve got to implement practical, real-world solutions that make a difference when it comes to the safety and dignity of students at their school.\xc2\xa0 Posting a law enforcement officer outside of every bathroom, and checking the birth certificate of people who are walking through the door -- that\'s not a practical solution.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to enhance anybody\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to enhance anybody\xe2\x80\x99s dignity.\xc2\xa0 That\'s impractical.\xc2\xa0 It\'s rooted in a political argument that has very little grounding in actual facts.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I recognize that that is sort of something that politicians frequently do, which is make arguments that may sound good politically just to score some political points.\xc2\xa0 But to do that at the expense of students all across the country is something I don\'t think that they should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the question of civil rights, I mean, are you parsing here that it\'s not a civil rights issue?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this because the courts still haven\'t ruled on whether there is protection under the law of transgender persons as a protected class, as an extension of sex discrimination?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s undeniable is this is an issue where case law is still being built up.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think the reading of this guidance I think is pretty common-sense.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t discriminate against people because of their gender identity.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t force people with a specific gender identity to use a different facility.\xc2\xa0 That\'s discriminating against them.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we should do is we should treat every student the same.\xc2\xa0 We should protect every student\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\xc2\xa0 We should protect every student\xe2\x80\x99s dignity.\xc2\xa0 We should give every student access to individual-use facilities if that\'s what they prefer and they\xe2\x80\x99re available.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the cornerstone here of our argument.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying the case law is still being built up, but you\'re not going so far as to say that this is on shaky legal ground because we still haven\'t seen the federal protection?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t mean to telegraph any lack of confidence in the legal conclusion that\'s been reached here.\xc2\xa0 The law is clear.\xc2\xa0 And I think it should be notable that it\'s not just the Department of Education that signed on to this, but the Department of Justice has too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point that I\'m trying to make, Margaret, is that this is something that is relatively new.\xc2\xa0 This is a relatively new policy consideration that school administrators are having to make.\xc2\xa0 This is a relatively new element of our political debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was thinking about Chris earlier today because there was some discussion about whether or not the word \xe2\x80\x9ctransgender\xe2\x80\x9d had ever been uttered from the White House podium before.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s a pretty apt illustration of how this debate is changing and has emerged.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s new to our political debate, but this is not new when you consider what school administrators have had to do to ensure the safety and security of every student at their school.\xc2\xa0 This is something that they have to deal with every day.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why most of them don\'t have a lot of tolerance for a bunch of cheap political rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re looking for solutions.\xc2\xa0 And solutions are exactly what were provided by the Department of Education in their letter today.</p>\n<p>\n\tRich.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying that this is a problem that school administrators are dealing with, but then it was also a problem that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist until it entered this political realm.\xc2\xa0 How long has the administration been getting questions about this?\xc2\xa0 And did the North Carolina law prompt this guidance or speed its timeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It did not.\xc2\xa0 This is guidance that had been in the works for years.\xc2\xa0 This is relatively new to our political debate, but again, this is something that has been the source of questions that the Department of Education has received for a number of years now.\xc2\xa0 And again, those questions to the Department of Education were not rooted in the desire of a high school principal to make a political argument.\xc2\xa0 It was rooted in the desire of a high school principal to get some advice and to rely on the experts at the Department of Education to help him or her ensure the safety and dignity of every single student at their school.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what these principals are looking for.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, in most cases, principals aren\'t making a whole lot of money.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a glamorous job.\xc2\xa0 But they do it because they care deeply about our children.\xc2\xa0 They care deeply about providing a good, quality education to our kids.\xc2\xa0 They care deeply about the future of this country.\xc2\xa0 They care deeply about ensuring that a learning environment that they are responsible for managing is one that\'s respectful, that\'s inclusive, and that is safe.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the kind of guidance that they were seeking from the Department of Education about how best to accomplish those goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the administration think, though, or acknowledge at least, that there still is a very difficult process here?\xc2\xa0 For example, the guidance says that when a student or the student\xe2\x80\x99s parent or guardian, as appropriate, notifies the administration that the student will assert a gender identity that differs from their previous representations, the school will begin treating that student consistent with the gender identity.\xc2\xa0 And then it goes on to say the gender transition can happen swiftly or over a long duration of time.\xc2\xa0 If a principal is sitting in front of a student, there could be questions of clarity, sincerity.\xc2\xa0 These are all things that are still not answered and out there, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this goes to Ron\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 We acknowledge -- and, in fact, this is what should happen:\xc2\xa0 School administrators do have to make decisions about the best way to protect the dignity and safety of the students at their school.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, these are complicated issues, and that\'s setting aside even the kinds of arrangements that might be available to a school administrator.\xc2\xa0 And so many of our schools are so wildly underfunded, right?\xc2\xa0 So you face this question about are we going to build a new bathroom, or are we going to provide up-to-date textbooks in our science classrooms.\xc2\xa0 These are practical questions that administrators are going to have to answer for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why it would not be wise for the federal government to be imposing a solution or adding an additional requirement under the law.\xc2\xa0 That\'s, in fact, why we have not done that, because we believe in the value and the importance of local control of schools.\xc2\xa0 So we want schools and we want school administrators to be reaching the kinds of conclusions and the kinds of solutions that are in the best interests of that community and that are in the best interests of the students who attend that school.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s also why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the U.S. Department of Education draw upon solutions that have been implemented by schools all across the country and surfacing those good ideas and sharing them with other school administrators that are trying to solve the same problem.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a pretty high-functioning U.S. Department of Education providing a valuable service to school administrators all across the country that are simply just trying to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment for their kids.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, the administration has come out very strongly on these issues, with the action against North Carolina, with its guidance today.\xc2\xa0 And those are domestic issues.\xc2\xa0 Internationally, the United States still has relationships with and gives aid to countries that puts LGBT people behind bars, charges them and executes them.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. going to exert its influence internationally on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Rich, I would tell you that we do.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly advocates for the rights of all people when he travels around the world.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly have made direct statements -- let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 The President has been crystal-clear both in public settings, but also in private settings, in his conversations with world leaders about our expectation and the priority that we place in this country on human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we threaten funding?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that that has been a question that has been discussed in a number of other settings about whether or not significant human rights violations undermine the relationship that the United States has with other countries, or in some cases, could even interrupt funding that is provided by the United States to other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was an amusing situation a couple of years ago where there were questions about whether or not the United States was going to interrupt the federal aid that we provide to Egypt in the aftermath of a crackdown on political dissidents there.\xc2\xa0 Now, that situation is not funny, but it did provoke an amusing response here as I tried to describe the way that funding is provided to individual countries and tranches, and so some people had some fun with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it underscores that this is a policy priority of the President when he travels around the world.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve sat in rooms where the President is talking to world leaders, and the President of the United States respectfully but directly raises concerns about the treatment of minorities in their countries, including the rights of gays and lesbians, and the rights of political dissidents, the rights of women, the rights of journalists.\xc2\xa0 And, look, as a country, these are values that we are deeply invested in and we use our influence around the world to try to advance those values.\xc2\xa0 And the President makes that case rather forcefully, both in public and in private, on American soil and when he\xe2\x80\x99s abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on the guidance.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect lawsuits?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what I expect is that the vast majority of school administrators are going to take a look at this guidance and figure out a way to implement it in their schools.</p>\n<p>\n\tKenneth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 To follow up to the follow-up to the follow-up on the question of transgender guidance.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m summoning a lot of patience today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration in its final months expect to issue any more guidance on topics, issues that the Education Department is dealing with?\xc2\xa0 For instance, there\xe2\x80\x99s a hearing that happened this morning where mothers said that football slowly killed her son because of concussions.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, are there any other directives or issues or guidance that the administration plans to give out that impacts the nation\xe2\x80\x99s children, like guidance on CTE?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements about additional Department of Education guidance that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be issued in the months ahead.\xc2\xa0 You can certainly check with the Department of Education to see if they can give you a preview of what other policies they may have in store.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Zika, back to that for a second here.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned yesterday a list of things that the Republican-led Congress has not done, such as Zika, Puerto Rico, opioid addiction.\xc2\xa0 Well, the House passed --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Passing a budget.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Passing a budget.\xc2\xa0 The House passed 18 bills on opioid addiction yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And on Zika, I know you mentioned that the funding is not on the current legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s making its way through right now.\xc2\xa0 Does the President expect to pass these pieces of legislation if they reach his desk?\xc2\xa0 And are you championing the bipartisan effort by the Florida senators, Rubio and Nelson, to give fully funded $1.9 billion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly welcome the bipartisan support that our Zika proposal has received, including from Senator Rubio.\xc2\xa0 I think this reflects the degree to which, for all of our policy differences with Senator Rubio, when it comes to looking out for the public health and wellbeing of the American people, there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a partisan difference.\xc2\xa0 And I think Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson both understand the consequences for mothers and babies in Florida of not doing everything possible to fight Zika.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly welcome that show of bipartisan support from Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson, and hope that the United States Senate and the United States House will listen to the advice of our public health experts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe $1.9 billion number was not chosen at random -- it actually reflects the sum total of efforts that our public health professionals say they can and should take over the long term to protect the American people from Zika.\xc2\xa0 So if there are some public health professionals in the United States Congress that have looked at this carefully enough to offer up their own alternative, they can do that.\xc2\xa0 But $1.9 billion is what our public health professionals say that we need.\xc2\xa0 $1.9 billion is what our bipartisan governors from all across the country believe that Congress should provide so that they can fight Zika in their communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s strong bipartisan support for our proposal because it\xe2\x80\x99s rooted in the facts, because it\xe2\x80\x99s rooted based on the advice of the top scientists in the country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we welcome the support of Republican senators like Senator Rubio.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we welcome the support of Democratic and Republican governors.\xc2\xa0 And we would welcome bipartisan congressional passage of some legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would the President sign anything less than the $1.9 billion request?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a process that, unfortunately, is still working its way through the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 We would have liked to have seen Congress begin this effort many months ago.\xc2\xa0 The President convened a meeting with his national security team and his public health experts in January to discuss this issue.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of weeks later, he signaled his intent to request resources from Congress.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of weeks after that, we put forward a specific proposal that detailed how that $1.9 billion would be spent.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we worked at a very rapid pace over the winter to put forward this request.\xc2\xa0 Three months now have gone by, almost three months, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen very little movement from Congress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been quite disappointing.\xc2\xa0 But maybe as people like Senator Rubio weigh in and demonstrate bipartisan support for this recommendation from our public health professionals, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll build up some momentum here.</p>\n<p>\n\tSuzanne.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on another issue.\xc2\xa0 On the day that the President is hosting several world leaders -- the refugee crisis, it was back in September that he pledged he wanted to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the country by the end of fiscal 2016, October.\xc2\xa0 So you have some time, but the latest State Department statistic is showing just a little more than 2,000.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration confident that you\xe2\x80\x99ll reach your goal of 10,000 by October?\xc2\xa0 And can you also explain some of the delays and the slower-than-expected process that they\'ve gone through?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s been some of the issues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Suzanne, the challenge here is simply this -- that individuals who enter the United States through the refugee program are subjected to more screening, more background checks than any other individual who tries to enter the United States.\xc2\xa0 These individuals have to undergo a background check, they\xe2\x80\x99re interviewed in person, biometric data about them is collected, and then all of that information is then run through databases that are maintained by the United States military, U.S. intelligence agencies, other national security organizations in the United States, but also law enforcement organizations in the United States and law enforcement organizations overseas.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo all of that work takes time.\xc2\xa0 And the President was clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to cut corners when it comes to security, even as we meet this ambitious goal.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody was under the expectation that there would be a linear increase in the number of refugees that would be admitted to the United States.\xc2\xa0 I think we always contemplated that this is a program that would ramp up over time as we added capacity and as we added our capacity to conduct these background checks.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to do to meet this goal.\xc2\xa0 It is an ambitious goal and it will be challenging to get it done.\xc2\xa0 But last year around this time, there were questions raised about whether or not we would meet our previous refugee goal because we\xe2\x80\x99d fallen behind pace.\xc2\xa0 But yet, based on the good work of our professionals at the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security, we did succeed in meeting that goal last year.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear that meeting the more ambitious goal this year is a top priority.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that all the people who are working on this problem understands the priority that the President has placed on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How has the political rhetoric, the harsh language, and some of the fear that\xe2\x80\x99s been drummed up around immigration and around the refugee crisis impacted the administration\xe2\x80\x99s ability to get them through the pipeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s had an impact.\xc2\xa0 The people who are working on this inside the U.S. government are professionals, and they understand exactly what needs to be done when it comes to implementing these vigorous background checks.\xc2\xa0 They understand why it\xe2\x80\x99s important that a thorough vetting be conducted before refugees are admitted to this country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 And the political noise has not impacted their ability to do their jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, the administration is confident it will be able to reach its goal of 10,000?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am confident that the people who are operating this program understand that the President of the United States thinks this is a top priority, and they have work to do to meet this challenging goal.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly intend to reach this goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tJanet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Going back to immigration, many of the critics -- immigration critics have called for refugee status for the Central American families.\xc2\xa0 Will there be any action on that?\xc2\xa0 And would you say that this is in correlation to the spike of Central American families crossing the border, that have been apprehended at the border in the last few months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 As Secretary Johnson has indicated, the operations that are underway are a continuation of operations that were previously announced.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I do think it is important for people who are in Central America and contemplating making the dangerous journey through Mexico to try to get to the United States, these operations should make clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s not an option -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not a viable option.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt should also make clear to parents in particular that child smugglers who say they can sneak their kids into the United States are not telling the truth.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, entrusting your children to those smugglers is dangerous and we strongly encourage people not to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s an important thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand what the policy is in the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important for people to understand what we have tried to do.\xc2\xa0 And what we have tried to do is to enhance the assistance that the United States provides to countries like Guatemala and Honduras.\xc2\xa0 Last year, in the omnibus budget proposal, about $700 million was provided by Congress to improve the security situation in some of those countries or make contributions to try to improve the security situation there and try to address some of the root causes that would prompt people to undertake this dangerous journey.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if this serves to discourage people from considering to make this journey, that would be a good thing.\xc2\xa0 But our motivation for carrying out these operations is rooted in President Obama and Secretary Johnson\'s commitment to enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that in a way that is humane.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that people have access to due process.\xc2\xa0 The only people who would be subject to operations like this are people who are subject to an order of removal by an immigration court.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe only people who could be part of an operation like this and removed from the country would be people who have exhausted any sort of claims for asylum or humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0 So there are rules that govern this, but at the end of the day, the President is serious about enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 The President does continue to believe that there is a better way, and that comprehensive immigration reform legislation through Congress would improve the way that we manage our immigration system in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is no viable way for refugee status for these Central American families?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there has been a discussion about working with the United Nations to allow people in Central America to apply for asylum and be considered, be carefully vetted for inclusion in some sort of refugee process.\xc2\xa0 And we have worked diligently with the United Nations to try to get that process up and running.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of work to do with regard to establishing that program, but there has been some consideration that\xe2\x80\x99s been given to that idea.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s notable about that is that is an application process that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t begin in the United States, it actually begins in Central America.\xc2\xa0 And, again, that should serve as an encouragement for people who are interested and think that they may be eligible for that kind of humanitarian relief that they can apply for it in their home country.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t have to undertake the dangerous journey to try to get to the United States.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t have to trust a smuggler.\xc2\xa0 They can apply for that status in their home country.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, as you know, data out today show pretty sharp increases in murder rates in the last few months in about 20 different cities.\xc2\xa0 Is that a reason for concern?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any more to say on Comey\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of that data?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything to say beyond what I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I will say that when Director Comey was talking about this he acknowledged that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of ambiguity about the broader trends, because in some parts of the country we haven\'t seen an increase in violent crime and, overall, crime across the country is at or near historic lows.\xc2\xa0 The example that he raised that I think is an illustrative one is that we have seen a spike in violent crime in Dallas, but not in Houston.\xc2\xa0 So the question is what accounts for that differing environment?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we\'ve got experts at the Department of Justice who are taking a look at these situations.\xc2\xa0 What President Obama did last year was actually direct his Attorney General to ramp up the assistance that we can provide to local law enforcement that is trying to fight these violent crime spikes in some communities in the country.\xc2\xa0 And that additional assistance has taken a variety of forms.\xc2\xa0 It has included widespread sting operations that were carried out by U.S. marshals to round up individuals who were wanted for violent crimes.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also additional assistance that\'s been provided to individual law enforcement organizations to improve training of their law enforcement officers to make them more effective.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is some assistance that the federal government can provide to law enforcement agencies that are dealing with these kinds of spikes.\xc2\xa0 But it is unclear what\xe2\x80\x99s contributing to those spikes, because we do know that as a general matter, all across the country crime rates remain at or near historic lows.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You dismissed his notion that there is some sort of Ferguson effect and I think you talked about there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence to back that up.\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\'m trying to understand is do you think that he is wrong, or do you think that he just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the evidence to substantiate what he said?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a difference -- either you\'re not sure, or you\'re sure he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. Can you help me untangle that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the point that I was making yesterday is -- and this is based on a conversation I had with the President -- this administration makes policy decisions that are rooted in evidence, that are rooted in science.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t make broad, sweeping policy decisions or draw policy conclusions based on anecdotal evidence.\xc2\xa0 That\'s irresponsible and ultimately counterproductive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President actually has a lot of confidence in the vast majority of law enforcement officers all across the country to do their jobs and to do them well and to do them selflessly and to do them in a way that is effective in fighting crime and protecting civil rights at the same time.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe -- at least he has not seen evidence to substantiate the suggestion that there are a significant number of police officers out there who are unwilling to do their job because they fear being filmed by somebody\xe2\x80\x99s cellphone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, if there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that materializes to substantiate that claim, then we should figure out something to do about it.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the point is there isn\'t evidence out there to draw any firm conclusions about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 The President does have a lot of confidence in the vast majority of law enforcement officers that are selflessly protecting our communities and doing it in the right way.\xc2\xa0 But we should look at this problem and get to the bottom of what exactly is going on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Director Comey did indicate that it\'s unclear what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 He acknowledged that it\'s a complicated situation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s where he used the Dallas-Houston comparison to illustrate that there is no clear answer to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, and what Director Comey said is we need to spend more time trying to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s right about that.\xc2\xa0 And we should use the evidence that is uncovered to formulate an appropriate politics response.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President believes the priority should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of uncertainty about everything.\xc2\xa0 You guys are swimming in uncertainty.\xc2\xa0 We all are.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one has to act in the face of uncertainty anyway.\xc2\xa0 You\'re suggesting, it seems to me, that you\'re not acting because you don\'t have evidence, when, in fact, in nearly every case, you have to act in the face of uncertainty anyway.\xc2\xa0 Can you help me sort of, again, untangle that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is we do often -- the President often talks about this, about how often uncertainty impacts the decisions that he\xe2\x80\x99s required to make as the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 That uncertainty typically applies to situations in which there are no guarantees that what the President is prepared to choose will work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, for example, if we determine that the so-called Ferguson effect is potentially contributing to an increase in crime, then we need to sit down and figure out what can we do to address it. And there will be some uncertainty about whether or not that will work.\xc2\xa0 But there won\'t be uncertainty about the fact that we\'re trying to solve the right problem, that we\'re trying to solve a problem that actually exists, and so collecting evidence to verify what is possible to know even if, once we get to the stage of considering solutions, there will naturally be some uncertainty about what the future holds.\xc2\xa0 But even in that case, there will be some evidence to inform the choices that the President has to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got more dead bodies.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s clearly a problem.\xc2\xa0 Whether --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\'m not denying that there is a problem as it relates to the spike in violent crime in some communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President, last year, ordered the Attorney General to provide some additional assistance to law enforcement agencies.\xc2\xa0 We saw the Marshals Service carry out a widespread sweep that resulted in about 8,000 fugitives being captured.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of evidence to indicate that there are some communities -- again, this is not a widespread phenomenon, at least based on what we know now -- but there is evidence to indicate that there are some communities, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s hometown of Chicago, that are experiencing a troubling surge in violent crime.\xc2\xa0 And the President has ordered action, specific action to try to address it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s not evidence at this point to link that surge in violent crime to the so-called viral video effect, or the Ferguson effect.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just no evidence to substantiate that. And there\xe2\x80\x99s some anecdotal evidence to indicate that that may be having some impact, but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of anecdotal evidence that the vast majority of law enforcement officers, men and women across the country, are doing their job as well as ever; that they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting crime, that they\xe2\x80\x99re protecting people\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights, that they\xe2\x80\x99re acting selflessly and bravely to communicate -- or to protect the communities that they are sworn to serve and protect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the ambiguity that exists.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we need to get to the bottom of before we start offering up specific solutions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the transgender question, can you help us untangle the President\xe2\x80\x99s role himself?\xc2\xa0 Like did he play a direct role in the guidance?\xc2\xa0 Did he meet with his Attorney General in the last week or recent weeks to discuss this?\xc2\xa0 Did he meet with his Education Secretary in the last week or the week before to discuss this?\xc2\xa0 Did he encourage the issue himself of this guidance?\xc2\xa0 And what in particular might have persuaded him that this was the right thing to do?\xc2\xa0 So can you -- a little bit more about what President Obama himself, what role he played in this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you about the President is he was he was regularly updated as this policy process moved forward.\xc2\xa0 So he was certainly aware of the policy that was under deliberation by the Department of Education.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that the outcome does reflect his view that the Department of Education should be responsive to requests that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received from school administrators and that the Department of Education has an obligation to put forward tangible, real-world suggestions for how this problem can be addressed in communities all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President also agrees that imposing an additional requirement under the existing law is not something the Department of Education needs to be doing right now.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s possible, and in fact, important for the U.S. Department of Education to play an appropriate role in offering this guidance to school administrators that are trying to enhance the safety and protect the dignity of every student in their community.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The suggestion is that he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a bystander to this guidance coming out -- that it was part of a process, that it came out of the departments, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really do much to encourage or discourage, it just sort of happened.\xc2\xa0 Is that an appropriate interpretation?\xc2\xa0 Or did he play a more active role?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the President sets a longer-term vision for the priorities that his administration is going to pursue.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to all of the conversations that President Obama has had with the Education Secretary about this or other matters.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is fair to say -- and I think it\'s important -- that this kind of announcement reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s strongly held view about the need to prevent discrimination, but also the need to protect the safety and dignity of every student in America.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this does reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 But, at the same time, there\xe2\x80\x99s an established policy process for considering these kinds of questions and ensuring that the outcome reflects the priorities that were set by the President of the United States. In this case, they were.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In an interview with the Rutgers student newspaper, President Obama defended his administration\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown on leaks and press freedom by saying the prosecutions were a small sampling.\xc2\xa0 But the truth is the administration has targeted more whistleblowers and prosecuted more leak investigations -- including of my colleagues -- than all previous administrations combined.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks?\xc2\xa0 Does he -- is he aware of just how many more leak investigations this administration has conducted versus all of his predecessors?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think we\'re going to get deep into this today.\xc2\xa0 But let me say a couple of things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is, what the President said is true, that a number of those investigations were initiated by the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 What is also true is questions of criminal investigations and criminal prosecutions are not influenced by the President or any other political operatives in the White House.\xc2\xa0 These are decisions that are made by Department of Justice prosecutors.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s the way the process should work.\xc2\xa0 And it would be inappropriate for the President to intervene either way.\xc2\xa0 It would be inappropriate for the President of the United States to intervene with the federal prosecutor and say, you should go investigate this individual.\xc2\xa0 It would be just as inappropriate for the President to intervene and say, you should lay off that guy from The New York Times.\xc2\xa0 That would be inappropriate too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve got a Department of Justice that is insulated from politics for a very good reason.\xc2\xa0 And you should check with them for insight into the prosecutorial decisions that attorneys at the Department of Justice were making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that these prosecutions took place during his administration?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he then went on to sort of talk about how his notion himself is that there should be as much freedom as possible.\xc2\xa0 As you say, these prosecutions took place during his administration, and your suggestion is that it took place essentially without any input from him or any of his direct -- in the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m suggesting it would be a genuine scandal if that were not the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s right.\xc2\xa0 So is he sorry that this number of prosecutions took place during his administration, given the fact that he can do nothing about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the President does believe that people who swore an oath to protect sensitive information should follow it.\xc2\xa0 And the President does believe that the Department of Justice and other agencies have a role in enforcing that oath.\xc2\xa0 And that enforcement should take place without regard to political considerations.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s just such an inquiry that\'s going on right now that I\'m not going to comment on, but I think is an indication that this is something, at least when it comes to the handling of these kinds of matters by the Department of Justice, that should be firmly insulated from politics, and therefore, insulated from influence by the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know of any previous state dinner that celebrated five countries at once, Josh?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 That would make tonight\xe2\x80\x99s event all the more special.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, I\'ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0 And then we\'ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to Rutgers on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Why did he decide to go to Rutgers?\xc2\xa0 Were any loud voices urging him to go?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us an advance preview of what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for years, students and other leaders at Rutgers have been encouraging President Obama to consider delivering the commencement address this year because it\xe2\x80\x99s the 250th anniversary of the first commencement address -- the first commencement ceremonies that were hosted at Rutgers.\xc2\xa0 So the President is looking forward to participating in this historic occasion.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is the mark of a remarkable institution of higher learning.\xc2\xa0 I know that Rutgers, in particular, is quite proud of the class of 2016, and the President is looking forward to congratulating that class on all that they have achieved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think he\xe2\x80\x99ll have some observations about the world that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to enter.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to enter a country and a planet that\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly changing.\xc2\xa0 And these students are as well-prepared as any students have ever been to confront those challenges and use this changing environment to create a better world.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the President so fundamentally optimistic about the future of our country, and that optimism is manifested quite well in this year\xe2\x80\x99s graduating class at Rutgers.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I do a week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he visit the (inaudible) at all while he\xe2\x80\x99s at Rutgers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any notes about any unplanned, any unscheduled movements for the President, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if he is able to make the most of his visit to Rutgers.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo on Sunday -- this is not written down here, but obviously on Sunday, the President will travel to New Jersey and deliver the commencement address at the 250th commencement at Rutgers University.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will host a Medal of Valor ceremony at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The Medal of Valor is awarded to public safety officers who have exhibited exceptional courage, regardless of personal safety, in the attempt to save or protect others from harm.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will participate in a DNC roundtable.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will award the National Medals of Science and Technology and Innovation to 17 scientists, engineers, mathematicians and innovators.\xc2\xa0 The Medal of Science recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science, engineering and mathematics.\xc2\xa0 The National Medal of Technology and Innovation recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America\xe2\x80\x99s competitiveness and quality of life and helped the nation\xe2\x80\x99s technological workforce.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then on Saturday, the President will depart Washington, D.C. en route Hanoi, Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 This trip will highlight the President\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing commitment to the U.S. rebalance to Asia and the Pacific, designed to increase U.S. diplomatic, economic, and security engagement with the country and peoples of the region.\xc2\xa0 So this is obviously next Saturday, a week from tomorrow, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot more to say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to the Asia Pacific during next week\xe2\x80\x99s briefings.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with all that, I hope you guys all have a great weekend.\xc2\xa0 See you on Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Starting now?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I resisted making that joke out of deference, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll pick it back up next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:45 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
