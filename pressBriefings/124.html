EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you in a slightly different environment than we\xe2\x80\x99re used to.\xc2\xa0 But obviously today is the day that many of you have been waiting for for a long, long time.\xc2\xa0 The President has released his fiscal year 2017 budget.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some presentations here at the start before we get to your questions, but there\xe2\x80\x99s one point that I wanted to make before I turn it over to Shaun here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s simply this:\xc2\xa0 Budgets are important because they enumerate priorities.\xc2\xa0 And when you have something that\xe2\x80\x99s this detailed, there\xe2\x80\x99s no fudging.\xc2\xa0 It becomes quite clear when you look at the numbers what you believe rates.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the importance of this exercise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I readily acknowledge, as I have on many occasions, that there are some priorities that we have that are deeply held that Republicans in Congress do not share.\xc2\xa0 And there will be differences of opinion about the priorities that are laid out in here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However, there are a number of areas where there should be bipartisan agreement.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of priorities that are reflected in this budget that are priorities that are held by Republicans according to what they say.\xc2\xa0 One good example of that is cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 There is a robust proposal in here that many of you have already reported on that includes a stepped up investment in protecting the country, protecting government systems from cyberattacks and cyber intrusions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important piece of business that\xe2\x80\x99s critical to our national security; it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly critical to our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Republicans on the Budget Committee won\xe2\x80\x99t even have a conversation with us about it.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I guarantee you -- I guarantee you that at some point over the next year, we\xe2\x80\x99re all going to file into the briefing room and I will walk in and find many of you on the edge of your seats eager to ask the White House about the latest cyber intrusion -- it may be the government agency, it may be at a private sector company that is well-known.\xc2\xa0 It may even be a media organization.\xc2\xa0 And when you do, I will discuss the efforts that we have made over the first seven years of the presidency to strengthen our cyber defenses.\xc2\xa0 I will certainly make detailed note of the significant investments that we are proposing to enhance our nation\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 And you can be certain that I will point out that when we put forward this proposal, Republicans on the Budget Committee refused to even discuss it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think you, rightfully, and the American people, rightfully, will have lots of questions about Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to confronting this issue that is critical to both our nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy and our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that tee-up, let me go -- turn it over to Shaun for a more detailed overview of what is included in the budget, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll start taking some questions from all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Also, thank you to Jason, Cecilia and Jeff for joining today.\xc2\xa0 And I think as we begin this discussion of the budget, it\xe2\x80\x99s useful to just take a moment and take stock of our economic and fiscal progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Under the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, we\xe2\x80\x99ve turned our economy around and created more than 14 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 Our unemployment rate is below 5 percent for the first time in almost eight years.\xc2\xa0 Nearly 18 million people have gained health coverage as the Affordable Care Act has taken effect.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve dramatically cut our deficits by almost three-quarters, and set our nation on a more sustainable fiscal path.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to take stock of our progress, but this budget is not about looking back; it is about looking forward.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about choosing investments, as Josh has said, that not only make us stronger today, but enable us to make progress towards the kind of country that we aspire to be.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is absolutely committed to using every minute of this last year to make such progress -- to deliver for the American people, and in particular, to address many of the challenges he highlighted in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 The budget is a path toward meeting those challenges.\xc2\xa0 It accelerates the pace of innovation to tackle climate change, find new treatments and cures for cancer and other diseases, transform our infrastructure, and grow our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It makes investments to give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and economic security, including investments in education, job training, support for working families, and modernization of our benefit structure to reflect our evolving economy.\xc2\xa0 Cecilia and Jeff are going to say more about those two different areas in just a moment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it advances our national security and global leadership with increased funding with our effort to destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 As you just heard, a more than one-third increase in cybersecurity across the federal government, and a range of other investments to protect the American people and advance development and democracy around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The budget shows that these investments in growth opportunity and security are compatible with putting the nation\xe2\x80\x99s finances on a strong and sustainable path. \xc2\xa0It makes critical investments in our domestic and national security priorities while adhering to the bipartisan budget agreement that was signed into law last fall.\xc2\xa0 As you may recall, that fully paid-for agreement allowed us to avoid harmful sequestration cuts -- the second time that Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to avoid sequestration -- and provided dollar-for-dollar funding increases for both defense and non-defense priorities for 2016 and 2017.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The budget also puts forward paid-for mandatory investments that are critical to building durable economic growth and maintaining America\xe2\x80\x99s edge as the leader in innovation and cutting-edge science, support jobs <span class="s2">and</span> economic growth, and expand opportunity.\xc2\xa0 The budget finishes the jobs started by the past two bipartisan agreements, and prevents the return of harmful sequestration funding levels in 2018 and beyond.\xc2\xa0 It replaces those savings by closing tax loopholes and with smart spending reforms.\xc2\xa0 And it also drives down deficits, keeping them below 3 percent of GDP through the entire 10-year period, and it maintains our fiscal progress through $2.9 trillion in smart savings from health care, immigration, tax reforms and other proposals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 $375 billion in health savings grow over time and build on the Affordable Care Act with further incentives to improve quality and control health care cost growth.\xc2\xa0 And critically important, those proposals in the budget would extend the life of Medicare for more than 15 years.\xc2\xa0 It also contains $955 billion of revenue from curbing inefficient tax breaks for the wealthy and closing loopholes for high-income households.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It also includes immigration reform along the lines of the 2013 bipartisan bill, which the administration supported, which would reduce the deficit by about $170 billion over the first 10 years and by almost $1 trillion over two decades.\xc2\xa0 As a result of all these changes, the budget stabilizes federal debt as a share of the economy, and then puts it on a declining path through 2025, a key measure of fiscal progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, let me just build on something that Josh said before I turn it over to Jason.\xc2\xa0 I want to take a moment to talk about the importance of this budget as we move forward with the debate this year.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to adopt the conventional wisdom that a President\xe2\x80\x99s final budget isn\xe2\x80\x99t relevant, but I think the conventional wisdom is wrong.\xc2\xa0 With many final-year budgets, you either see an administration dramatically trim its sails and dial back on ambition, or you see a budget that is solely a vision document with little that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to the debate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This budget falls in neither of those camps.\xc2\xa0 The budget offers a range of proposals where there is bipartisan support for taking action.\xc2\xa0 Josh talked about cybersecurity, but to name a few others, there is a significant bipartisan interest in investing in cancer research, ensuring that everyone struggling with opioid addiction can get treatment, and expanding tax credits that support work and reduce poverty to workers without kids.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other cases, we may not get bipartisan support, but the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to shy away from proposing solutions that are both good for our economy and address major challenges that we face.\xc2\xa0 Those proposals may not be enacted this year, but they lay the groundwork for reaching solutions in the long run.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The bottom line is that in the final year, in a season full of political distractions, the President and the administration remain focused on meeting our greatest challenges and delivering for the American people.\xc2\xa0 We will spend every day of this last year doing just that, with this budget as our roadmap.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Jason, who is going to discuss the economic outlook and budget assumptions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks to all of you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Shaun.\xc2\xa0 As Shaun mentioned, the U.S. economy continues to strengthen in the last year as the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent in the face of significant global headwinds that have weighed on the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looking ahead, the administration expects that the economy will grow at an average rate of 2.5 percent over the next three years. This forecast, finalized this past November to give agencies time to prepare their budget forecasts, is in line with contemporaneous forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office, the Blue Chip Consensus of Private Sector Economists, and the International Monetary Fund.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Starting in 2019, the budget assumes a GDP growth rate of 2.3 percent annually.\xc2\xa0 The GDP forecast reflects continued growth in consumer spending, which grew at a solid pace over the last year, reflecting the savings from the recent drop of energy prices, the ongoing improvement in household finances, and increased consumer sentiment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moreover, both residential investment and R&amp;D grew strongly in 2015, with R&amp;D reaching its highest level as a share of the economy on record, and both have continued room for growth in 2016.\xc2\xa0 And thanks to the budget agreement at the end of last year, fiscal policy has shifted to a moderately accommodative stance as compared to the fiscal drag that had been faced in previous years.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, our economy will continue to face significant headwinds on a number of dimensions as foreign demand continues to slow, the oil industry continues to adjust to lower prices and the associated transmission of these events through recent financial market developments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other notable change in the forecast is a reduction in project interest rates with a 10-year Treasury note expected to eventually settle at 4.2 percent.\xc2\xa0 This projection is slightly more conservative than the CBO and Blue Chip interest rate projections.\xc2\xa0 These lower expected interest rates also have important implications for broader macroeconomic and fiscal questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Overall, some of our assumptions are more conservative than the assumptions made by the CBO; some are more optimistic.\xc2\xa0 But they average out to a very similar outlook for the 10-year baseline deficit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, let me turn it over to Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I just want to do a minute or two on innovation, which as Shaun said, is a cornerstone of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 In fact, innovation has been at the center of the job recovery.\xc2\xa0 You see this in manufacturing, for example, where there\xe2\x80\x99s been a revitalization in advanced manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 And investments in innovation in manufacturing have helped to create 900,000 manufacturing jobs just over the last six years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also see it in clean energy.\xc2\xa0 We kickstarted a transformation in how the U.S. produces energy, with solar energy production up thirty-fold since 2008.\xc2\xa0 And this has supported good job growth of good jobs in the solar industry.\xc2\xa0 In fact, solar jobs are growing at 12 times faster than the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of this is consistent with the U.S. is number one in the world in innovation.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hypercompetitive marketplace.\xc2\xa0 The global competition is intense.\xc2\xa0 China and other countries are investing heavily in research and development, and they\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything they can to eat into our lead.\xc2\xa0 So we need to accelerate the pace of innovation to build the economy of the future and continue to create high-quality jobs, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget does.\xc2\xa0 It proposes investments that will ensure the U.S. continues to set pace in technology and innovation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just highlight three areas very quickly.\xc2\xa0 The first is a 21st century clean transportation system.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bold plan that\xe2\x80\x99s proposed to increase investments in surface transportation overall by 50 percent, including transformative investments in rail and transit.\xc2\xa0 It also supports -- importantly, it supports the development of breakthrough technologies like autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Upgrading our infrastructure helps businesses move goods faster to market, and this proposal is fully paid for by a $10-a-barrel fee on oil, paid for by oil companies, that would support hundreds of thousands of good, American jobs, and helps the environment by reducing carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 More broadly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget doubles clean energy research and development -- it calls for a $7.7 billion investment in early-stage R&amp;D on clean energy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a 20 percent increase.\xc2\xa0 And this will keep us at the vanguard of the clean energy revolution.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The final innovation initiative I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention is cancer.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget invests more than $750 million in the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s cancer moonshot.\xc2\xa0 This builds on progress that we made in last year\xe2\x80\x99s budget, or what is the current year\xe2\x80\x99s budget, to invest about $200 million of new money in cancer research at NIH, and to bring together the private sector and the federal government to push the frontier of data and technologies with the goal of doubling the rate of progress in cancer treatment and research.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget sets out a clear plan to enhance America\xe2\x80\x99s position as the number-one country in the world in innovation by investing in what we do best:\xc2\xa0 building the next must-have, \xe2\x80\x9cMade in America\xe2\x80\x9d product; making the next clean energy breakthrough; and finding the next lifesaving cure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, let me hand it over to Cecilia.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 So as you heard the President express in the State of the Union address last month, one of our key challenges as a nation is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re finding a way to give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and economic security.\xc2\xa0 And our competitiveness, as he says, depends on tapping the full potential of all Americans.\xc2\xa0 So this budget makes very particular investments in accomplishing those goals, in particular by supporting education and training opportunities, supporting workers and their families, providing access to health care, and other investments to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re all able to contribute to our maximum capacity in our country\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this includes continuing investments in the educational system, from the earliest years all the way through higher education.\xc2\xa0 So expansions in high-quality early childhood education; cutting taxes for families that are paying for childcare; building out the most effective Head Start programs, including, very importantly, making sure that students in Head Start can attend for a full day and for a full year; and investing in pre-K for all four-year-olds in the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget also includes funding for his new Computer Science for All initiative, which is a $4 billion investment to states and another $100 million that would go directly to districts to create access to computer science education at all levels, from pre-K all the way through high school.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to that, the budget includes significant new investments in the Pell grant program, and these are aimed in particular at helping students in the Pell program complete their educations.\xc2\xa0 So there are incentives to help students who are taking a full credit load of 15 credits.\xc2\xa0 And then for students who are doing that, also incentives to allow them to use Pell grants for an additional semester.\xc2\xa0 So it would allow them to use the Pell program year around.\xc2\xa0 And what this does is essentially help folks in the Pell program complete on time, which is important to reducing the overall cost of a college education.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget also calls for $2.5 billion in new tax incentives to encourage employers to play a more active role</p>\n<p>\n\tin the educational and training process.\xc2\xa0 So these this is the proposed Community College Partnership Tax Credit, which builds on our work to increase access to skills and to make sure that the skills education that\'s happening at our community colleges and technical schools is aimed at the kinds of jobs which are becoming available in this growing economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are also, as you heard Jeff and Josh say, very important investments in health.\xc2\xa0 You heard Jeff talk about cancer.\xc2\xa0 There are investments in mental health and opioids and combatting the Zika virus; important investments in child nutrition, in particular electronic benefits to kids in the school meal program so that we can continue their access to food and meals over the summer, as well as using Medicaid data to help with the enrollment process for kids in the school breakfast and lunch program to help facilitate their enrollment and to help make sure that we\'re feeding kids adequately.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what this all adds up to is a focus on opportunity, on economic security, and really making sure that we\'re investing in the full potential of all Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, let me turn it back to Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s go open it up for questions.\xc2\xa0 Who wants to go first?\xc2\xa0 Wait for the mic there.\xc2\xa0 And do you mind introducing yourself?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned a couple areas where you see opportunity for bipartisan agreement -- the EITC, cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if based on the vociferous reactions you heard this morning from the Republicans and based on the fact that we\'re in an election year, what gives the President hope that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be any movement on these priorities and not simply a CR pushing it to whoever is inaugurated next January?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, why don\'t I take the first stab at this?\xc2\xa0 And if anybody wants to weigh in here, they can.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think there are two things that come to mind.\xc2\xa0 The first is there was a lot of pessimism at the beginning of last year about whether or not this administration would be able to make progress on a range of priorities that we identified.\xc2\xa0 Considering that Republicans had just enjoyed a significant victory in the midterm elections that increased their majority in the House of Representatives and gave them a majority in the Senate for the first time in a while, that pessimism was well founded.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But through some perseverance and a willingness on the part of some Republicans to try to find common ground, we made progress on a whole range of things that nobody would have previously considered possible.\xc2\xa0 We got a five-year transportation bill done at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 We reformed the No Child Left Behind bill to make sure that we\'re not over-testing our students.\xc2\xa0 We got a budget agreement that was -- thanks to the good work of a lot of the people who are sitting on the stage right now, not me -- that allowed us to ensure that we would not abide by sequester caps that would undermine our ability to invest in economic and national security priorities.\xc2\xa0 We got the debt limit extended without significant drama or delay.\xc2\xa0 We got IMF reform -- something we had long sought.\xc2\xa0 We got a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Most of those were things that Republicans were strongly opposed to.\xc2\xa0 At least they said they were strongly opposed to them.\xc2\xa0 But yet, we were able to work aggressively and find common ground with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 None of the bills that I just described were perfect.\xc2\xa0 But they did all reflect compromises.\xc2\xa0 And Republicans who were part of those compromise deserve credit for trying to find that kind of common ground that\'s in the best interests of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So our experience last year gives us some optimism of what is possible this year, particularly when you consider that there are so many opportunities that are ripe for bipartisan agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The kinds of things that Shaun laid out that do represent bipartisan potential are not things that we -- these are not positions that we are ascribing to Republicans.\xc2\xa0 If you called Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 offices -- which hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll do after this briefing -- they themselves will tell you that they are interested in things like expanding the EITC program to promote work and give an incentive to workers who don\xe2\x80\x99t have children.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, cancer research -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk on the campaign trail both among Republicans and Democrats in New Hampshire right now about doing more to fight opioid addiction and heroin abuse.\xc2\xa0 And we often talk about cybersecurity -- that\xe2\x80\x99s actually a bipartisan compromise that was achieved at the end of last year that I failed to mention.\xc2\xa0 There was legislation that this administration put forward at the beginning of last year and urged Congress to pass.\xc2\xa0 It took them the whole year to do it, but they did it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for the country.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more that they should do -- and they did it not because we talked them into it, but because we put forward a good proposal that would actually strengthen the country\xe2\x80\x99s cyber defenses.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the experience of last year certainly informs our relatively optimistic view about this year.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that we have some legitimately bipartisan proposals that both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge would be good for the country that we can put forward and hopefully work on together.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So let me pile on a little bit.\xc2\xa0 It would be interesting to go back and look at the press releases they put out last year when the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget came out.\xc2\xa0 I think the words \xe2\x80\x9cdead on arrival\xe2\x80\x9d were heard quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 Relevance was questioned.\xc2\xa0 And exactly to Josh\xe2\x80\x99s point, not only did we get a lot of wins; in fact, the budget agreement that was struck in October and then the omnibus in December followed the structure that the President laid out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe got 90 percent of the increased investment that the President called for.\xc2\xa0 It was dollar for dollar on the defense and non-defense side.\xc2\xa0 Those were the two bright lines the President laid out at the beginning on funding.\xc2\xa0 He said we have to end sequester, we have to do it dollar for dollar, defense, non-defense.\xc2\xa0 And the third thing he laid out was we have to do it without poison-pill riders.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happened, is we defeated the poison-pill riders in the deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Below the surface, there were many, many things -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the types of things that Josh talked about -- we made a down payment on the opioid epidemic last year.\xc2\xa0 Cecilia talked about our investments in Head Start.\xc2\xa0 We made a big start towards -- over $400 million of increase in Head Start toward full-day, full-year, a plan which the President laid out.\xc2\xa0 State grants to expand universal pre-K, apprenticeships -- I could go on and on.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a broad range of things that we got done last year that were bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 We also got a bunch of things done like the Green Climate Fund.\xc2\xa0 We got funding to implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Power Plan.\xc2\xa0 We got important new investments at the IRS, which Republicans had said there was no way were going to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So both on bipartisan things and things that were priorities of the President but not shared, we got a lot done last year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only other thing I would just say on this -- and there are many of those same priorities that are in this bill that I think have real bipartisan support, and others that I think we have a lot of leverage to get.\xc2\xa0 The question here is not for the administration.\xc2\xa0 We took a very clear position -- we were going to live by our word.\xc2\xa0 We were going to write our budget to the deal last year, even if that meant we were going to make some tough choices.\xc2\xa0 And we made those tough choices.\xc2\xa0 As Josh said, a budget is very specific.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to show your priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the question here isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fight between the administration and Republicans; it\xe2\x80\x99s a fight within the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing, despite some people saying on the Republican side we should live by the deal, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing others that say we ought to cut below the deal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing others that say we ought to raise defense spending above the deal without non-defense.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I think the question for the Republican Party is where do they stand on this, and are they going to be able to function in Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s really the question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be up to them whether this is something -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve done our part with this budget, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be up to them to see whether they can deliver on their promises to get back to regular order this year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Angela.\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you wait for the mic just so everybody -- the dozens of people who are watching on camera here can hear you at home.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We at Bloomberg have dozens watching, at least.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Angela Greiling Keane with Bloomberg.\xc2\xa0 Question on the revenue projections for the international tax reform proposals.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve more than doubled since last year\xe2\x80\x99s budget, and we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out where that doubling comes from.\xc2\xa0 It goes to $484 billion from -- sorry, $238.3 billion last year, which is a pretty sizeable difference.\xc2\xa0 And then one other question along those same lines.\xc2\xa0 The per-barrel oil tax last week was billed as $10 and today it\xe2\x80\x99s $10.25, so what accounts for that difference as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I take both of those?\xc2\xa0 I will have to check the numbers.\xc2\xa0 The proposals for business tax are very similar to last year.\xc2\xa0 I thought the scores were largely similar to last year.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference in the budgetary treatment of the whole package that stems from the extenders package that had passed at the end of last year, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t I explain that to you?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last year, we treated business tax reform as revenue neutral, put it in a box in the budget, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any of those policies adding into the budget totals because it was assumed that they were paying for business tax reform.\xc2\xa0 This year, we continue to be committed to business tax reform, and we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to it on the same basis that we were last year, which is to say, we think it should pay for tax extenders.\xc2\xa0 We had proposed to pay for tax extenders last year in a compromise with Congress in order to get things done.\xc2\xa0 We agreed to do last year without paying for them.\xc2\xa0 But if we come back and reform the business tax system, we\xe2\x80\x99d want to make up for that revenue this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so the current budget treatment flows through all the different tax loophole closers and structural changes to the business tax system towards the overall budget number with that goal of being revenue neutral relative to the baseline we had established last year -- in other words, paying for tax extenders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will take a look, and you can also talk to Treasury about how any particular item change in terms of its scoring -- often there\xe2\x80\x99s technical changes from year to year on the scores, but there were no major policy changes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In answer to your second question, we described the oil tax as about $10 per barrel.\xc2\xa0 It phases in over five years and then it\xe2\x80\x99s indexed to inflation.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s literally a different number in each of those years and we were giving you the rounded number.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add one thing.\xc2\xa0 On the international tax side, I think we have also seen that there are an increasing number of companies that are proposing or have actually been carrying out inversions.\xc2\xa0 And so one of the things that is contributing -- there are other technical issues, but one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s contributing to that change in score is Treasury observing a larger number of companies that aren\xe2\x80\x99t taking advantage of what we think are loopholes that need to be closed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken significant actions with our existing authority, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also calling on Congress to move changes to stop inversions as well, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that is highlighted by the change in numbers that you point to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Mary Bruce with ABC News.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, on the $10-a-barrel oil tax, how much of that do you anticipate will be passed on to consumers?\xc2\xa0 And any concern that that could hinder some of the broader economic growth that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing?\xc2\xa0 And also, on the timing, can you explain why the decision was made to release today what is one of the biggest political (inaudible) of the year?\xc2\xa0 And if the Super Bowl was a factor, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, why not hold it for later in the week?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 So I think we all see it on our way to work in terms of roads or airports or transit or rail.\xc2\xa0 Businesses, as I said, are losing lots of money and are paying lots of money, and are undermining their position in the global economy because our infrastructure is no longer a source of competitive advantage.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s a vulnerability.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s really a hidden tax on consumers or commuters -- some estimates say that\xe2\x80\x99s over $900 per year in lost hours in fuel costs.\xc2\xa0 It certainly, as I said, hits our businesses.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s urgency to build on what Congress did at the end of last year and invest significantly in our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the fee itself, it is paid by oil companies.\xc2\xa0 We anticipate that oil companies will pass some of that on to the consumers of various oil products, and that\xe2\x80\x99s important here in that this is not just about automobiles.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about airplanes and rail and other forms of transit that consume oil.\xc2\xa0 And oil, as I said earlier, is responsible for about 30 percent of carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 So this is a strong plan that addresses the fact that we have this hidden tax on consumers and businesses because of the inadequacy of our infrastructure across all modes.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important proposal that enhances our competitiveness and as I said, will save consumers and commuters time and energy costs.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Just on the question about timing, obviously February in general is crowded this year.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure given both the February statutory release date and, frankly, the fact that Congress was so late in getting the budget done that we were going to be able to find a day that was sort of free from other distractions.\xc2\xa0 I think the important point here is based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely determined focus on using every day of his last year to deliver for the American people.\xc2\xa0 We had a State of Union that was one of the earliest on record. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve already, before today, rolled out more than 20 specific proposals that are in the budget.\xc2\xa0 And actually, we think given the distractions that we have more broadly from candidates that are talking down the country and, frankly, presenting a dark picture of where the U.S. is headed, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to capture I think a remarkable amount of attention to a broad set of budget proposals that really are about the future and about the hopefulness that the President has about the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think despite the timing of the day today, this has been a budget release that\'s really been ongoing for a number of weeks now.\xc2\xa0 And I think certainly my sense -- and I give a lot of credit to our press team and others that have worked on it -- that this is something where we really have captured the imagination of the American people in a lot of ways.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The last thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say about that, Mary, is I think Republicans cancelling the budget hearing is actually the clearest evidence that it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans who don\'t want to have a public discussion about the budget.\xc2\xa0 We certainly welcome the opportunity, and maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get them to change their mind.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 About that, does the lack of an invitation resonate with you in a way that makes you understand that there is not going to be a lot of bipartisanship, maybe not a lot of cooperation coming up in this year?\xc2\xa0 Or am I over-reading that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think the second question -- you can also weigh in on that, if you would, Josh -- second question I would have is, is there a tax increase in this budget?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what\xe2\x80\x99s that level?\xc2\xa0 And last, I notice that there is a specific read on immigration reform as a means for saving money within the budget.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious how that plays out when you consider the lack of the likelihood that immigration reform will actually take place even in fiscal \xe2\x80\x9917.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me take the last question first.\xc2\xa0 Just to step back for a minute, I talked about the broad fiscal progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made under the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and that this budget would continue that progress.\xc2\xa0 One of the key areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made enormous progress is on health care costs.\xc2\xa0 The President came in and identified health care costs as one of the single-most important drivers of our long-run fiscal challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And through the ACA and a range of other steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made enormous progress.\xc2\xa0 Just to give one specific example, the budget makes clear -- just in the year 2020, we now believe that we will save about $185 billion, just in that one year, because of the slow growth of health care costs and better projections since the Affordable Care Act was passed.\xc2\xa0 So enormous progress on what is among the biggest drivers of our long run.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the second thing we have to realize is that a big fiscal challenge we have is keeping our promises to the Baby Boom generation.\xc2\xa0 The budget goes through -- and I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into all the details -- but we\xe2\x80\x99re moving from where just a few years ago, we had 3.2 workers per retiree to a place that we can see in the next decade where we\xe2\x80\x99ll have 2.4 workers per retiree.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one of the most important things about immigration reform is that it brings in more workers.\xc2\xa0 Those workers contribute to society.\xc2\xa0 They pay taxes.\xc2\xa0 They boost our economy.\xc2\xa0 And these are not just our numbers; the Congressional Budget Office says the same thing.\xc2\xa0 Their projections are that we would save $170 billion in this decade.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted those numbers in the budget.\xc2\xa0 And that savings grows; it becomes almost $1 trillion when you add in the second decade.\xc2\xa0 So immigration reform is not just the right thing to do for families and our economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for our fiscal future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the point about bipartisanship, Josh was very clear up front that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep putting out what we think is right independent of whether we think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that will be adopted by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But we should remind you that there was bipartisan support for exactly the bill that we are adopting in our budget.\xc2\xa0 It passed in the Senate with bipartisan support, and our hope would be that after we get through the distractions and the bombast of this political season, that we could return to doing the right thing for the country.\xc2\xa0 And we think immigration reform is part of that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 And in answer to your question on taxes, the budget proposes $277 billion of tax cuts for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That helps everything from child care, with tripling the child tax credit for people with younger children; pro-work, by having a tax credit for secondary earners.\xc2\xa0 It simplifies and expands tax credits for college.\xc2\xa0 It expands a tax break to encourage both small businesses to offer savings plans and people to take them up, and also expands the EITC for people without qualifying children, either because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have children or they\xe2\x80\x99re non-custodial parents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You take all of those together, and the main experience that most Americans would get in terms of their taxes as a result of this budget would be a tax cut for things like child care, college, retirement savings, work and low-income households.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As part of the deficit plan, the budget does, as a whole, curb a set of tax breaks for high-income households.\xc2\xa0 One of those, for example, limits the value tax deductions and tax exclusions for high-income households to 28 percent.\xc2\xa0 That would only affect households making above $250,000 a year, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that my predecessors Greg Mankiw, Marty Feldstein, Glenn Hubbard and Alan Greenspan have all described are more akin to a spending cut, because that\xe2\x80\x99s spending that takes place through the tax code for high-income households that\xe2\x80\x99s being cut.\xc2\xa0 Another example of that is a loophole for high-income households on their net investment income, which we would propose to close here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the revenue is coming from high-income households, it\xe2\x80\x99s coming from cutting back on tax expenditures, closing tax loopholes, not raising rates.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add one thing to that?\xc2\xa0 You asked about the tax side, but this is a balanced proposal in our budget.\xc2\xa0 As I said, we decided to live by the agreement that was reached last year, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some hard choices.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we have 117 different cuts, consolidations, or savings proposals in the budget.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit about health care savings -- about $375 billion there.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got 15 different proposals that save over $100 billion on program integrity, for example.\xc2\xa0 We have smart savings proposals on everything from crop insurance to a range of other things.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to step back.\xc2\xa0 Since the President came into office, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had deficit reduction of about $4.5 trillion.\xc2\xa0 This budget adds additional $2.9 trillion of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 If you put those all together, we\xe2\x80\x99re still getting more than 50 percent.\xc2\xa0 Even if we adopted every one of the proposals in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget that Jason just talked about, we\xe2\x80\x99re still getting more than 50 percent of that $7.4 trillion in deficit reduction from spending reductions, not from revenue increases.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that this is a balanced proposal both on the spending side and on the tax revenue side.\xc2\xa0 And we stand by that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Deficits to GDP are under 3 percent every year of the budget window.\xc2\xa0 And debt to GDP we take from -- under current law, if we did nothing, would be increasing substantially over the window.\xc2\xa0 And we stabilize debt to GDP and actually start bringing it down through 2025.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And, Kevin, I just want to go back quickly to the bipartisan thing, which is we\xe2\x80\x99ve observed many times that with Republicans in control of Congress and Democrats in charge of the White House, anything that gets done is going to have to be, by definition, bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 So the question really for Republicans at this point is, are they going to do anything?\xc2\xa0 Are they going to use their majority in Congress to strengthen our cybersecurity, to fight opioid addiction, to cure cancer?\xc2\xa0 Or are they not?\xc2\xa0 And I think the question really is left for them, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward specific proposals in our budget for how precisely we could do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on this gentleman right here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Charlie Clark with Government Executive Media Group.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans seem to want to have a reduction in number of workers in the federal workforce and maybe even abolish some agencies.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, is the upshot of this budget a net increase in the size of the federal workforce, or as they would call it, the size of the government?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 We do have particular places within the federal government where we think there needs to be increased investment in the number of people as well as the skills of those people.\xc2\xa0 Cybersecurity is a very good example where that\xe2\x80\x99s a place that\xe2\x80\x99s a critical national need where we do propose both increasing number of personnel, as well as raising their skills.\xc2\xa0 We have a $62 million investment as part of the cyber plan that the President announced today that really goes to this workforce piece of the issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we have other places -- for example, the Veterans Administration, where we continue to enhance the number of people we have there to respond to what is really a wave of veterans that we are bringing back from overseas, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a sacred promise that the President has made.\xc2\xa0 I would also point to another example of a place like IRS, where the cuts from the Republican Congress had been so deep that we got to a place last year where we were only answering 40 percent of taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 phone calls -- 40 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we had a win in the budget last year where we got almost $300 million of increase.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re now up to answering 60 percent of taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 phone calls.\xc2\xa0 But obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, we\xe2\x80\x99re losing billions of dollars of revenue from taxes that should be paid that are due to the federal government because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the personnel.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are clearly places where we do need more workers, but there are other places where we\xe2\x80\x99re making smart changes and finding efficiencies.\xc2\xa0 And overall, what we see is just a small proposed increase in the federal workforce, overall, when you balance those together.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, right here in the front.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Julie Davidson from LRP Publications.\xc2\xa0 To build on that, can you talk about how the budget supports the people and culture pillar of the President\xe2\x80\x99s management agenda, and how you decided on a 1.6 percent increase for federal employees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONOVAN: Well, just to take the second question first -- obviously, particularly with the second year of the budget deal being less than the President had called for in his budget, we had difficult choices to make in a number of areas.\xc2\xa0 And one of those is the tough choice about how much we should be increasing pay for federal workers.\xc2\xa0 We worked closely with the military, with DOD, to see the results of their review of compensation.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately we settled on a 1.6 percent increase both for military and for civilian workers.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe settled on a 1.6 percent increase, both for military and for civilian workers.\xc2\xa0 That is something that obviously builds on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- the progress on our deficit and our progress more broadly economically -- and allows us, as opposed to in past years, where we had a freeze and then a 1 percent increase, and then for 2016, a 1.3 percent increase, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously making progress here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it also is important to recognize that inflation overall has remained very, very low.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, to the point where we are starting to see significant wage growth, I think the best -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to Jason here, but the best six months of wage growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of the recovery over the last few months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think this represents progress in terms of paying government workers what they deserve, but also one where we did have some tough choices to make.\xc2\xa0 The only other thing I would just say in terms of other critical investments that we\xe2\x80\x99re making -- our people are one of the single-most important assets that we have in the federal government, and we do have major investments in training, in employee engagement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been encouraged that the employee viewpoint survey across the federal government showed real progress.\xc2\xa0 In fact, for the first time in history, every single question in that survey showed positive movement.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single question where results went down, and we think that that is a measure of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re making, in addition to the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to upgrade and improve our recruiting, moving our systems into the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And I think Beth Cobert, who we believe ought to get confirmed swiftly by the Senate, is doing a terrific job in moving us forward at OPM.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron Allen from NBC.\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said early in your opening that this is all about priorities and you can tell what\xe2\x80\x99s more important to the administration.\xc2\xa0 Is there anywhere in the budget that takes account of the plan to close Guantanamo Bay? \xc2\xa0And why not?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xc2\xa0 And if not, how is that going to happen now?\xc2\xa0 Or is it something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve given up on, or that the President has given up on?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have always envisioned putting forward the separate plan for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s consideration that would factor in some of the financial impacts of actually moving forward with closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 One of the chief reasons that we have advocated for closing the prison is that the individuals who are detained there and need to remain detained can be more cost effectively detained in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what our proposal will underscore.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of them that would be transferred, a number of others that are going through a criminal justice process, either through a military commission or an Article 3 Court.\xc2\xa0 But cost effectiveness is one of the reasons that we are looking to close the prison.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other reason, obviously, is we know that extremist organizations use the continued operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have seen Democratic and Republican national security experts come forward and advocate for the closure of the prison.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll put forward a plan to Congress at some point -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of timing.\xc2\xa0 But when we do, it will include some information, at least, about the budgetary impact, and that\xe2\x80\x99s information that we won\xe2\x80\x99t just present to Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99ll also present it to all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, but why not put this in your budget, which, as you say, is your statement of your most cherished priorities, and that, as I understand it, is one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is a priority.\xc2\xa0 The plan is just not done yet.\xc2\xa0 So when it is, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want to add to that, Shaun?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I was just going to say that there was a specific provision in the Defense Authorization Bill that set up a process to do this separately and with a timeline and everything that didn\'t match up with the budget.\xc2\xa0 So it is a very high priority.\xc2\xa0 Just for reasons that there was already a process and a separate piece of legislation, it didn\'t make sense to marry it up with the budget given what Josh said about our ongoing work on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, you said the plan is not done.\xc2\xa0 But there has been some reporting suggesting that the plan is in fact done, and that you\'re waiting for the opportunity to move it forward.\xc2\xa0 Is it not done or is it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The latest update that I have received is that the President has not signed off on a final plan at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there a concern in the budget -- there is a plan for Medicare savings -- is there a concern that those measures could be perceived as cuts and that could be used against Democrats on the campaign trail?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then also on a separate issue, there also seem to be proposals to cut spending on refugees but yet the administration has called to ramp up asylum -- or ramp up the asylum program.\xc2\xa0 So how do you reconcile that?\xc2\xa0 Or is that a misinterpretation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the first one on health -- which is, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach from the beginning has been if you can lower national expenditures, you can reduce premium growth, save money for the budget, and extend the life of Medicare.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s win-win-win.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we did in the Affordable Care Act, and you see the benefits now with health cost growth being the lowest in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act added 13 years to the life of Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act helped put us in a better position for our budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The types of savings we\'re proposing now are very much in that spirit, as well.\xc2\xa0 So if you reduce overpayments to drug companies for dual-eligibles in Medicare and Medicaid, you can save over $100 billion.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not something that is coming at the expense of people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s actually part of a plan to help.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you can have competitive bidding in Medicare Advantage, you can squeeze out some of the extra margins that some of the insurance companies are getting within that system.\xc2\xa0 All of this would both continue to help slow growth of health costs, but it would also, together with the tax loophole that\'s being closed related to a tax that\'s related to Medicare, add more than 15 years to the life of the Medicare trust fund.\xc2\xa0 So this plan as a whole is going to help strengthen and sustain Medicare and help slow the cost growth of health care.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add to that by saying that Republicans in 2012 thought this would be a really effective argument.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll just point out that neither President Romney nor Vice President Ryan could be here to defend the effectiveness of that argument.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 On your question about refugees, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where those reports come from.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the budget meets our commitment that the President has made to increase the number of refugees that we would be able to welcome to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re happy to work with you -- show you the details of that.\xc2\xa0 But it meets our commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Traditionally, the EITC proposal from the administration for single adults has been financed through closing the carried interest loophole and some other sort of revenue raisers.\xc2\xa0 Given that Speaker Ryan has expressed a lot of interest in a very similar plan, but has sort of offered to pay for it with spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s current thinking is on sort of the parameters of that and what would be an acceptable pay-for there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to work together with Congress on an acceptable pay-for.\xc2\xa0 We have an awful lot of pay-fors to choose from in our budget, and I suspect you\xe2\x80\x99d see a lot of flexibility about which of those.\xc2\xa0 What you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see flexibility on is the principle that this proposal is meant to reduce poverty.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you cut one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s helping to reduce poverty and use it to expand something else that would reduce poverty, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t made the type of improvements that we envision.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of ability to work together.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d love to work together with Congress as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing this at the expense of the poor.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the question, Dylan.\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The baseline deficits worsen by about $1.8 trillion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 Could you go into some of the factors about why that is?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So we have, as I think Jason laid out at the beginning, a few that are the most important changes between the baseline from last year\xe2\x80\x99s budget and this one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, the tax extenders deal that was completed at the end of last year did raise deficits by a few tenths of a percent alone -- just that one package.\xc2\xa0 And while we agreed with a number of the extenders that were made permanent, and then they had been part of our business tax reform plan, as Jason said earlier, we were not in favor of doing that unpaid for.\xc2\xa0 We felt that there should have been a comprehensive plan on business tax reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so what we are doing in our budget this year -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99re able to stabilize debt and actually bring it down over the 10-year window -- is because we continue to propose comprehensive business tax reform that would offset the cost of the tax reform -- the tax extenders that were done at the end of last year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the single-most important change from last year.\xc2\xa0 There are also changes in the economic assumptions that I think really point to the critical importance of many of the investments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in terms of growing opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the things we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about, which the President really emphasized in his State of the Union, was that we have to modernize our system of supports for workers.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re proposing an unemployment insurance package of changes that includes a wage insurance proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s proven to help workers get back in the workforce more quickly, reconnect with the workforce, and ultimately be better off.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s another example of something that ought to be bipartisan if Republicans are willing to work with us.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 And one small point to add -- the baseline deficit projection is worse, as is the CBO.\xc2\xa0 And us and CBO are quite similar in that regard.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also proposed more deficit reduction this year.\xc2\xa0 So the deficit you get to under the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is similar to what it was last year, which is to stay consistent with the below 3 percent of GDP, and consistent with the debt on a stabilized and on a declining path through 2025, just like it was last year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you also spoke about the dwindling number of workers per retiree, which would seem to be an argument to deal with Social Security, but there\xe2\x80\x99s been no mention during this session about dealing with the Social Security trust fund and its solvency.\xc2\xa0 Could you go into why we\xe2\x80\x99re not addressing that, and why that\xe2\x80\x99s become less of a priority for the President during the tenure of his presidency?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I would point your attention to the budget includes a long-run outlook -- the deficit and debt over the next 25 years.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the same window that CBO uses for its long-run outlook.\xc2\xa0 And that shows that the deficit remains below 3 percent of GDP even in the out-years.\xc2\xa0 And at the end of that 25-year window, the deficit is actually shrinking as a share of GDP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly, the debt is stable as a share of GDP over that longer-run window, and is declining as a share of GDP by the end of it.\xc2\xa0 So we have, in the last seven years, made a lot of progress in terms of our long-run deficit that comes from steps like the Affordable Care Act, the tax deals we\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and also the broader slowdown in health costs.\xc2\xa0 And when you take all those improvements in the long-run outlook, which Doug Elmendorf recently cited in a paper that he put out last week, the improvements in the long-run outlook, together with the additional policies here, really do put you on a stable basis for the long run.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That being said, from the very beginning of this administration, the President has always said he was open to working together with Congress on a bipartisan basis to deal with Social Security, put out a set of principles at the beginning of this administration in terms of not slashing benefits, not privatizing Social Security, not taking away a system that works for Americans with disabilities, and some other socio-principles.\xc2\xa0 But the most important thing is looking at the budget as a whole, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made substantial progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just add two other points to that.\xc2\xa0 We did have an issue in Social Security that was critical to address last year, and that in fact we did address.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s another example of something the President put forward in his budget of 2016 that Republicans said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we\xe2\x80\x99re never going to fix the Social Security Disability program without major cuts in entitlements.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And in fact, we were able to get an extension of the disability trust fund, which would have run out of benefits in two years -- or the end of next year -- and would -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, at the end of this year, and would have put us in a place where we would have had to cut benefits by about 20 percent.\xc2\xa0 So that was the most urgent issue in Social Security, it was resolved last year, and it was done in a fiscally responsible way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I would also say -- and this builds on Jason\xe2\x80\x99s point -- if you look at the long-run challenges that we have on the fiscal side, Social Security is not a major contributor to that challenge.\xc2\xa0 But the other thing I think is important to recognize is immigration reform -- again, this issue of how many workers do we have paying into Social Security relative to the number of retirees.\xc2\xa0 One of the most important things that we can do is increase the number of workers that we have in this country, and also raise their wages.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And all of that can help us stabilize.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, CBO says, and Social Security actuaries say that immigration reform is an important contributor to strengthening Social Security.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s right that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have policies in this budget on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention it specifically, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the key things that immigration reform would do, would be to strengthen Social Security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We probably have time for a couple more.\xc2\xa0 Jordan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, Democratic leaders are going to be here meeting with the President and Vice President for the second time in three weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of back and forth between you guys and Republicans on the budget, but I was wondering if there was any thought put to having a similar meeting with Republican leaders to advance some of the proposals you say there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support on, like EITC and those other items.\xc2\xa0 I know they were here last week, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there was any thought to giving them a separate meeting to drill down on those.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d stand ready to have additional conversations with them.\xc2\xa0 The one that was scheduled has already been cancelled by the Republicans who chair the House and Senate Budget Committees.\xc2\xa0 So we have to sort of see a willingness on the part of Republicans to discuss these issues, but we obviously are eager to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident these are the kinds of things that are being discussed among Democrats, both in the current meeting but also all across Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 So there really is a decision that Republicans have to make about whether or not they want to make some progress this year.\xc2\xa0 They were given by the voters a new majority in the Senate and a stronger majority in the House, and I think a significant question that they have to answer is are they going to use that majority over the course of this year to try to do something good for the country.\xc2\xa0 There certainly are ample opportunities for them to do so, but will require them working in good faith to actually do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sarah.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just one quick clarification.\xc2\xa0 So you said that there was -- that Director Donovan was scheduled to be on the Hill to talk about the budget and it was cancelled as opposed to just not getting scheduled at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the reason -- the reason I say cancelled is because it\xe2\x80\x99s been held around the same time every year for 40 years.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s not being held this time, I guess -- if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the Super Bowl next year I think we\xe2\x80\x99d all say it was cancelled.\xc2\xa0 But I guess you could also say that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t scheduled.\xc2\xa0 Either way, that is a choice that\xe2\x80\x99s made by Republicans in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 And on the EITC and the broader poverty agenda, these are things that Paul Ryan has backed in the past.\xc2\xa0 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s Speaker.\xc2\xa0 Is that the main reason that there seems to be additional optimism that this can get through?\xc2\xa0 Or are there new proposals on that end from the White House that you think will make it even more enticing to Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are new proposals in this budget.\xc2\xa0 And it is an issue that we very much hope to take up in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us talk about EITC; that\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal that the Speaker has already put forward.\xc2\xa0 There is another proposal here in the budget that focuses on provided flexibility to states, particularly with folks of highest need.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot of research demonstrating, for example, that there are a significant number of families, including as many as 3 million kids, who live on less than $2 a day in cash.\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal in this budget which we think is pretty innovative, which is about working in a flexible way with states on a pile of programs to help address these families with the sort of most urgent needs to make sure that they have the support that can help them get back into the workforce.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yes, this is a conversation that we are interested in having.\xc2\xa0 As you heard Jason say, we need to have it in a way which is really about creating opportunity for families that are in poverty.\xc2\xa0 We think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of room for agreement, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 President Obama ran very hard against the Ryan budget in his reelection.\xc2\xa0 He said that it reflected veiled social Darwinism.\xc2\xa0 Now that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to work with Speaker Ryan, and especially on issues like poverty, has there been any kind of rethinking of the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s motivation?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that has come up?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of always been at blows -- coming to blows specifically around their respective budgets.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hey, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said today has tried to paper over the significant differences between the priorities that are identified by Republicans and the priorities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified in this budget.\xc2\xa0 I think our point is simply that given those significant differences, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the more important we should -- that we capitalize on those areas where common ground does obviously exist.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cecilia was talking about the EITC -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a good example of one.\xc2\xa0 Cybersecurity is another good example of that.\xc2\xa0 Investments in new research that would lead to a cure to cancer is another one.\xc2\xa0 Investments in helping fight the opioid epidemic across America is another good example.\xc2\xa0 So given the significant differences, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the more important that we seize on the common ground when it materializes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 And can I just add, this is less of a budget issue -- although there is a proposal in the budget that\xe2\x80\x99s aimed at the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do with respect to the criminal justice system.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s another area where the President has, in fact, invited members of Congress in from both sides of the aisle who are working together on legislation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s another area you heard him single out as a place where there is commonality and agreement, and where we think we ought to be able to get to a solution if people are prepared to roll up their sleeves and get the job done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a very good example.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I left that out.\xc2\xa0 This gentleman has been very patient.\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I give you the last one, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 In recent years, the administration has relied on projections of stronger economic growth to boost revenues to deal with some of the spending challenges we\'re going to face on the entitlement front.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, economic growth forecasts are consistently being revised down, which has pushed the debt-to-GDP ratio higher.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, if growth continues to disappoint relative to forecasts, does that leave the next President with less flexibility for new investments without raising taxes?\xc2\xa0 And if the U.S. economy were to fall into recession, is fiscal policy tapped out?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s probably for me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My microphone was red for a reason, Jason.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 So if you look at how the economy has evolved relative to our forecasts, some things have come in more favorable than we\xe2\x80\x99ve forecast and some things have come in less favorable.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So GDP growth has, as you said, been below the forecast.\xc2\xa0 The unemployment rate has also been below what we\xe2\x80\x99ve forecast.\xc2\xa0 And interest rates have been below what you forecast.\xc2\xa0 If you look at that all in, more often than not the deficit has actually come down relative to what was expected, rather than gone up.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly true I think for every single budget year -- or year before the budget, current year.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s true if you look forward, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you look at the thing that is the most important thing we\'re trying to accomplish here, which is to create a baseline for what the deficit is going to be over the next decade, those forecasts, if anything, have been on the conservative side over the course of this entire administration.\xc2\xa0 So that would be the first point I\xe2\x80\x99d make.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second point is consistent with that, the forecast.\xc2\xa0 CBO in the 10th year has a deficit of 5 percent of GDP in their baseline.\xc2\xa0 We have a deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP in our baseline.\xc2\xa0 There are some small differences in terms of comparing those, but they\'re generally quite similar.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re in the same ballpark as them.\xc2\xa0 We then propose a substantial amount through deficit reduction, which is what gets under the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, the deficit, to below 3 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next point I\xe2\x80\x99d make is that the long-run fiscal outlook is better now than what it looked like six or seven years ago.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s better because of the steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken and because of the slowdown on health costs.\xc2\xa0 If you look at measures like the fiscal gap, which are a way of gauging what the deficit is over the long run, that\'s smaller today than it was before.\xc2\xa0 Which brings me to the last point that I think our country does have the fiscal room, if and when it is ever needed at some hypothetical future date, to use fiscal policy as one of the tools that we would deploy in those circumstances.\xc2\xa0 If anything, the last seven years have taught us around the world that there probably was more fiscal room in a lot of countries to begin with than people might have imagined seven years ago.\xc2\xa0 And we have even more today than we had then.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 And just to add to that, we should be very clear that there is a fiscal choice in front of the Republicans in Congress right now, which is do they live up to the deal that we reached last year, or do they put us back into a place of manufactured crisis and fiscal -- mindless fiscal austerity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we see is that because of the budget deal we reached last October, the projections are that fiscal policy will, for the first time in many years, actually be contributing to growth this year.\xc2\xa0 The projections were that the budget deal would add 340,000 jobs this year, and another 160,000 in 2017.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\'t even include the confidence boost that we get from moving away from shutdowns, all of the terrible impacts that we had on consumer and business confidence from the kind of brinksmanship that we saw before.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Jason has really dealt with some of the longer-term issues.\xc2\xa0 As we talk about whether, in fact, Republicans are going to propose to blow up the deal from last year, cut spending below the levels that were agreed to, I think we do risk the kind of not just mindless austerity, but also manufactured crisis that we saw for too many years in our budgets.\xc2\xa0 And that alone is critical to fiscal policy in the short and medium term.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you all for spending so much time with us today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer to my colleagues at OMB.\xc2\xa0 Both Shannon and Emily can stand by to take any additional questions you have to ask.\xc2\xa0 Have a good day, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:30 P.M.
