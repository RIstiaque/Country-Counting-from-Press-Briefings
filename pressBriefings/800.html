EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way from the fantastic state of Wisconsin to the equally fantastic state of Ohio -- right -- that\'s where we\'re headed -- on this final day of campaigning.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to give you a couple of updates on the recovery efforts in the wake of Sandy.\xc2\xa0 As of this morning, more than 205,000 residents have applied for assistance with FEMA -- $192 million has been approved and directed to assist individuals.\xc2\xa0 The individual assistance grants, as you know, are part of the disaster declarations that the President expedited for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>\n<p>Today, Secretary Napolitano approved additional assistance to expedite support for state and local debris removal efforts.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano is in New York today and was in New Jersey yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Administrator Fugate was in New York yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is the update I have at the moment on the recovery efforts and the President\xe2\x80\x99s oversight of the federal response, except to tell you that he is currently participating in a conference call with Administrator Fugate, Chief of Staff Jack Lew, Secretary Napolitano I think, Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Mastromonaco, and some others about the recovery efforts and the federal response to Hurricane and Storm Sandy.</p>\n<p>And that\'s it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this Bruce Springsteen\xe2\x80\x99s first time on Air Force One?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\'re happy to check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 Before we do, in our final day of campaigning, I just wanted to tick through the states, since we do have an election tomorrow -- just as a reminder -- that we\'re going to be visiting today.\xc2\xa0 So Wisconsin -- as you know, we just visited the lovely state of Wisconsin -- in the latest polls, President Obama leads Mitt Romney by 15 points among those who have already voted or plan to vote early.\xc2\xa0 In Wisconsin, 266,287 voters in counties President Obama won in 2008 have voted, compared with just 95,449 in Republican-leaning counties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As Jay mentioned, we\'re next heading to the lovely state of Ohio.\xc2\xa0 Twenty-nine percent of Ohio votes have already been cast, and according to public polling, President Obama leads by 24 points among those who have already voted.\xc2\xa0 This means that Mitt Romney would need to win the remaining votes by 10 points in order to tie the race on Election Day.</p>\n<p>As you know, we end the day in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 I know you all know this, but it was worth repeating -- this is where the journey began for President Obama.\xc2\xa0 The state has always had a special place for him and for the First Lady in their hearts.\xc2\xa0 The location where we will be tonight -- his hold room is actually our old Iowa campaign headquarters, so that\'s kind of a nice little color fact for you.</p>\n<p>But Iowa -- let\xe2\x80\x99s see, 40 percent of Iowa votes have been already cast, and President Obama leads among early voters by 23 points in the latest polls.\xc2\xa0 This means that Mitt Romney needs to win the remaining votes by 23 points to tie President Obama on Election Day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry -- 40 percent?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Forty percent, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much does he lead by?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Twenty-three points.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a math major, but it seems like if 50 percent of the votes had been cast then you\xe2\x80\x99d need to match it to tie.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll check the math of our team.\xc2\xa0 They haven\'t been sleeping a lot, so we\'ll double-check that for you.</p>\n<p>The last thing, just to add, I know people have been asking about what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Later today -- you should have all received a list of the radio interviews he\xe2\x80\x99s taping later today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a dozen interviews, the majority of which, if not all of them, are airing tomorrow morning during drive-time.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re GOTV calls encouraging people to get out to the polls in target markets and with target constituencies.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s also live-to-taping an ESPN interview that will air during halftime this evening during Monday Night Football.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Tomorrow he will have about a dozen local, state satellite interviews he\'ll be doing throughout the day.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s possible he will do additional get-out-the-vote radio throughout the day.</p>\n<p>As many of you know who have been covering us for a while, there is a tradition to play basketball with friends and close advisors on Election Day.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that we\'re working toward and could be in the cards.\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, as he\xe2\x80\x99s always said, this campaign is about -- the bread and butter of this campaign is the volunteers and the neighborhood team leaders and people who have made this journey possible.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll be looking for an opportunity to thank them tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 As always, we\'ll keep you abreast as movements arise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what are the embargoes on those interviews that you\'re talking about?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I believe they were listed in there.\xc2\xa0 If not, we\'ll get you the list of when they\xe2\x80\x99re embargoed until.\xc2\xa0 The majority of them are for tomorrow morning during drive-time, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any chance of getting transcripts for any of them, or do we have to try and listen to them?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Unlikely.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re going to have to listen to them, because they air different pieces during different hours.\xc2\xa0 So we don\'t want to get ahead of the interviews themselves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, there were reports today that Mitt Romney may to go to Ohio tomorrow for some last-minute campaigning?\xc2\xa0 Does the President plan to make any stops in competitive states tomorrow or is he going to stay in Chicago all day?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 His schedule is as I just laid out, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no plans to leave the state of Illinois at this point.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that will change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that Mitt Romney is headed to Ohio, or reportedly headed to Ohio tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Without that state it\xe2\x80\x99s a rocky road for them to victory -- an insurmountable road, I would say.\xc2\xa0 We know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing a lot of head-faking games and going to states where they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a ground game, they\xe2\x80\x99ve never led in a poll and we have massive voter registration advantages.\xc2\xa0 Ohio remains a very difficult nut for them to crack.\xc2\xa0 And we feel we have a superior ground game and a superior campaign in the state and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident of victory there tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An insurmountable road -- is that what you said?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Without Ohio.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The GOTV stuff he\xe2\x80\x99s doing tomorrow, will that be from headquarters?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think there are satellite locations in a nearby hotel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Florida? It was a pretty chaotic scene there with early voting over the weekend.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking every voting report case by case.\xc2\xa0 Our focus has always been making sure everybody who is eligible to vote has the opportunity to vote.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for the American people, the right thing for the people of Florida.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So in Florida, we had several steps that were taken yesterday to open -- for early voting, in-person absentee voting in several counties.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a positive step forward.\xc2\xa0 We are at the point we are at because the Governor of the state cut early voting by six days and the lines were so long and the enthusiasm was so great for early voting that people were waiting in line for four and five hours.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work on that today.\xc2\xa0 And our plan is always, until the very last moment when the polls close, making sure people who are eligible have the opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re confident we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do that in Florida and in states across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The campaign sounds very confident that you have a path to victory and maybe that it\xe2\x80\x99s even a fairly clear path.\xc2\xa0 But if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, if this is a contested race, do you have a plan in place for Wednesday, and what it could look like?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s worth reminding you we\xe2\x80\x99re tied or leading in every single swing state.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re ahead in early vote in every -- almost every single swing state.\xc2\xa0 We feel great about where our ground game is now.\xc2\xa0 We feel great about where we\xe2\x80\x99re closing this race.\xc2\xa0 We know there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fantasy talk happening from the Romney team about the number of electoral votes that they think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to achieve.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into that kind of predictions.</p>\n<p>But the only thing that matters is that more people vote for President Obama than vote for Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re confident of that and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into hypotheticals beyond that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you predicting a popular vote victory as well then?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that more people in this country are going to support the President tomorrow when they go to the polls.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that in swing states across the country where this race will be decided, that people are going to vote to elect President Obama to send him back for another four years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the dynamic between Springsteen and the President a little bit?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 Are they sitting next to each other?\xc2\xa0 Are they in different parts of the plane?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about today?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re sitting across from each other in the conference room and were discussing a number of things, including the impact of the storm on New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 As you can imagine, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that is of interest to and concerns Mr. Springsteen.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other color for you at the time.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Jen does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Patti in there, too?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s question, you do have legal teams in a lot of these battlegrounds.\xc2\xa0 Are they pointing to any potential problems that you need to be aware of and be ready to react in those battleground states?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jim, because you\'ve been covering this a long time, every election year there are always case-by- case issues, which you deal with at the polls.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, we want to be prepared to make sure that people have confidence that their vote is going to count.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we have lawyers in states -- Florida, of course, is one of them; Ohio and any of these swing states.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re dealing with issues that come up on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Florida is a good example.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, when issues arose there with lines that were too long and the concern that people wouldn\'t be able to vote, we dealt with that as soon as it arose. And we\'re going to do that in states across the country over the next 36 hours we have to go here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How large is your legal team in Florida right now?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an exact number.\xc2\xa0 We have the number of people we need to ensure that people of the state feel confident that they can go to the polls and vote, that their vote is going to count and that their participation in the process matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Strategically, is there a reason why he\'s not doing any events tomorrow, not going to any states?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you said he\'s planning on staying in Illinois.\xc2\xa0 Is there a strategic thinking behind that?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I mean, obviously we\'ve had -- as you know, because we\'re all kind of high on coffee and doing jumping-jacks to stay awake here -- we\'ve had a pretty robust schedule the last couple of days, making sure we\'re hitting markets.\xc2\xa0 We will have hit probably hundreds of thousands of people in the final days of the campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because he\'s doing about a dozen radio interviews into target markets and he\'s doing about a dozen satellite TV interviews, he will actually be able to hit and reach people across the country, markets across the country, to communicate the choice in this election and the importance of voting.\xc2\xa0 That\'s very valuable.</p>\n<p>And it is -- you do make a choice between doing something like that and traveling to a state.\xc2\xa0 And we made the call that that\'s the way to reach people on Election Day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, beyond the case-by-case things that you talked about, does the campaign think there has been sort of a deliberate, systemic effort by Republicans either in Florida or Ohio or Colorado, either in the legislature, the secretaries of state, to curtail some of those voting opportunities that you all have worked to expand?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, the facts on this front are clear.\xc2\xa0 In Florida, the Governor cut early voting by six days.\xc2\xa0 In Ohio, the Secretary of State attempted to eliminate the three early voting days before Election Day, which have been historically -- at least in 2008 -- very big voting days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have a fundamental difference in how we view democracy and how we view the right of the American people to participate. We feel it\'s a given right to vote, to participate in the process and everybody who\'s eligible should have the opportunity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\'s not that there are more issues than there have been in past years, but you always want to be prepared to make sure that people who are voting for the first time, people who haven\'t voted in 20 years -- we\'ve seen many reports of people who are 90 and are voting for the first time -- are confident that their vote will count.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we\'re fortunate we have lawyers in states across the country.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to be dealing with issues on case by case.\xc2\xa0 We\'re confident we\'ll be able to resolve them.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Setting aside motivations, you know the President\'s view on this, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about it with regards to early voting -- that as a matter of principle and policy in this country, we ought to be doing everything we can to make it easier for Americans to vote and not harder.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about the value of early voting, because so many Americans might be working double shifts on Election Day, or having to transport their children to and from school or to and from daycare.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for many people to vote on Election Day, and there\xe2\x80\x99s every reason in the world to make it easier for Americans to vote so that more people participate in our democratic process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have confidence that people in the storm-ravaged areas of New York and New Jersey, where there\xe2\x80\x99s electronic voting machines in places with no electricity -- New Jersey had discussed vote by email and fax -- that those votes will all be counted in a fair way?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 As you kind of referenced in your question, these cases have been dealt with on a case-by-case basis at the state and local level.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest that people who were impacted by the storm have the opportunity.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen progress made in the past couple of days, thanks to the efforts of state and local leaders and the President and FEMA, to restore power, to make sure people have kind of the information and the resources they need.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with this as with any case, on case by case. But we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that people\xe2\x80\x99s votes will count, and that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to vote in these states.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mayor Bloomberg, who endorsed you last week, said that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot of confidence in the New York City Board of Elections.\xc2\xa0 Do you share that concern that he has?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 These cases are being dealt with on a case-by-case basis at the state and local level.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been making sure -- working hard to make sure people have the information and resources they need not just about how to vote, but also on resources they need around the storm.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll approach it that same way over the next 36 hours of the campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A somewhat unrelated question -- when was the last time the President spoke to a member of Congress about the fiscal cliff?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear, it has been for some time, what the right approach to dealing with our fiscal challenges is, and that is to adopt the principles embodied in Simpson-Bowles and every other bipartisan commission that\xe2\x80\x99s looked at this; adopt the position that Democrats, independents, and Republicans across the country believe is the right position and which happens to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, which is we should address these issues in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 We should continue to cut spending responsibly.\xc2\xa0 We should make changes to our entitlement programs that make them stronger.\xc2\xa0 And we should ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more so that revenue is part of this package, so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to voucherize Medicare in order to get our deficit under control; we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to slash education investments or investments in infrastructure, or research and development.</p>\n<p>That is a position and an approach that is broadly endorsed by a significant majority of the American people, and a significant majority of Democrats, independents, and Republicans who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the House of Representatives or the United States Senate at this very moment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So one way that we could address a portion of the challenge posed by the fiscal cliff is if the House of Representatives were to pass the bill that the Senate already passed that would extend tax cuts to 98 percent of the American people -- 98 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s agreement in Washington that 98 percent of the American people ought to have their tax cuts extended.\xc2\xa0 Democrats, Republicans, independents -- everybody says, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it, we\xe2\x80\x99re for it.\xc2\xa0 So Republicans in the House should not block that initiative, they should pass it.\xc2\xa0 And then we can discuss and debate whether or not the wealthiest 2 percent ought to have their taxes cut as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan in the drawer, waiting for the day after Election Day to get started on the fiscal cliff negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President discuss the need to resolve these challenges, and he looks very much forward to working with Congress to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 You covered it, most of you here did.\xc2\xa0 The way we get from here to there is not complicated.\xc2\xa0 And there are plans -- beginning with the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- that reflect the kind of approach we need to take to solve our fiscal challenges or to meet those fiscal challenges in a responsible way.</p>\n<p>And the President has believed and has said for a long time that he hopes that this election -- which in many ways has been included in the debate about these issues -- will help propel the process forward once the American people have spoken tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, back to Bruce Springsteen.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only celebrity surrogate that the President is relying on.\xc2\xa0 Is there a potential danger that glitz trumps substance here in these final days when you have all these other people who are out there pushing the vote for the President, but their power is a mere fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re celebrities?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think Bruce Springsteen might be offended by you calling him glitzy, but -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Send him back and see what he thinks.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think every time the President speaks, including today, he is laying out the case in this election, laying out what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done and what we need to do moving forward. The American people know what his plan is.\xc2\xa0 They know how hard he is going to fight for the middle class.</p>\n<p>At this stage in the game, with less than 24 hours to go until the polls open, a big focus is making sure people know -- who may be sporadic voters, who may be less likely to go to the polls, who may be a college student and think it\xe2\x80\x99s not important -- what the stakes are.\xc2\xa0 And Bruce Springsteen and some other celebrities who have been helping us reach a broad audience that sometimes tune out what\xe2\x80\x99s being said by politicians.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been a great supporter of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been a tireless advocate for him on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re thrilled he\xe2\x80\x99s here today, as I know many of you are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go after Kid Rock that way.\xc2\xa0 One governing question.\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about the response to the storm so far?\xc2\xa0 Does he see -- does he have any concerns about some areas that still remain unserved?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From before the time the storm made landfall, the President has been extremely focused on making sure that the federal response is as comprehensive and efficient and effective as possible.\xc2\xa0 That included pre-positioning many, many resources by FEMA.\xc2\xa0 It included pre-positioning individuals up and down the East Coast so that we had -- so that FEMA had personnel on the ground to assist with state and local authorities in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the storm.\xc2\xa0 And that effort continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You know that the President has been extremely forceful at tasking his administration and the members of his administration responsible for responding to an emergency like this with leaning forward, with making sure that bureaucracy and red tape does not get in the way of providing assistance to the states and localities and individuals who have been so affected by this storm.\xc2\xa0 And that effort continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it with his order that led to the airlift of assets owned by energy companies out West, from California to states that needed those assets in the Northeast.\xc2\xa0 You saw it in some of the measures that have been taken to provide fuel to affected areas in the Northeast.\xc2\xa0 And you see it in some of the details that I read out to you at the top of this briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President -- again, as we began this briefing here on Air Force One, the President was in his office participating in a conference call with senior members of his administration who are focusing all of their time on the federal response.</p>\n<p>There is no question that there\'s a long way to go here.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question that the storm was devastating.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no question that there are individuals who still are absolutely in need of assistance -- individuals and businesses who do not have power.\xc2\xa0 And the President is making sure that every time he speaks with governors and other state and local officials, that we\'re responding to their request for assistance, that there are no needs that are unmet that can be met by federal assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that has been his focus from before the storm landed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney and Ryan have both had a field day with the President\'s revenge comment in Ohio the other day where he said voting is the best revenge.\xc2\xa0 Does the President regret saying that?\xc2\xa0 It felt -- it seems like sort of an offhand comment and you guys described it that way.\xc2\xa0 Does he express any regret for phrasing it in those words?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The President never regrets making the case to the American people that if they don\'t like the plans Mitt Romney is offering, if they don\'t like the rotten deal he\'s offering to the middle class, that they have power to vote and cast their vote -- their ballot at the voting booth.\xc2\xa0 That was exactly what he was conveying with that comment, and absolutely no regrets.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a particular reason he hasn\'t repeated it since then?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You know, he talks about this and the power of the American people to have a voice in the process often, not only on the campaign trail but as it relates to moving policy initiatives forward.\xc2\xa0 I think he was kind of describing that on the -- when he was at that event, and we don\'t look back and have any regrets.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the truth is if Mitt Romney wants to close his campaign, which he is doing, attacking the President for saying that the American people have a voice in this process, that\'s nothing more than the small-ball and scare tactics that we expect from them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOh, one thing to add -- I\'m sorry, I forgot to mention this. I know you all are very focused on the vote totals as they\'re adding up on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I would caution you that California, rural communities, many parts of this country where it takes a little longer are going to come in a little later.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how that\'s all going to pan out.\xc2\xa0 But just a piece to as you look ahead tomorrow evening and you\'re watching the vote totals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Obama campaign has doubts about California?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Never.\xc2\xa0 I will wear a fake moustache, as I\'ve said before.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a grizzled veteran of the process, Jen is simply advising patience.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I am grizzled at this point in the game.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe not as grizzled as I am.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just logistically, the other day in Lima, David and David suggested they might do something this evening, a little preview -- another gaggle of some sort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- because we did it this morning, I don\'t think we\'ll do another one, because the event in Des Moines is like 10:30 p.m. at night.\xc2\xa0 But they\'re around.\xc2\xa0 So if people want to talk to them, we can absolutely help with that.\xc2\xa0 Just let us know.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll try to work for getting our other famous friend on the plane.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Reggie play basketball with the President tomorrow, or no?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 That is likely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to stay out of that.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 What about me?\xc2\xa0 I was captain of my middle school basketball team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, are you, Jen?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'m like Muggsy Bogues size.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wear your mouth guard.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not in my agenda tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that the tradition in primary races, too?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.\xc2\xa0 Yep, that\'s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you advise publicly details on the President\'s plans for tonight and overnight?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Oh, he\'ll be sleeping his home.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:56 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
