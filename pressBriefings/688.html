Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>**Please see below for a correction to the transcript, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>1:13 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re well.\xc2\xa0 It is a glorious day outside.\xc2\xa0 And while it is always a privilege and honor to stand before you, today it\xe2\x80\x99s a little difficult because I was just outside, and, man, is it beautiful.\xc2\xa0 I wish we could --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefing outside?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, one day, perhaps.\xc2\xa0 I know my predecessor tried that.\xc2\xa0 I think there were some logistical challenges involved in pulling it off.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But it really -- it could not be -- I had a rare gap in my schedule a little earlier today, and so I took a walk around the Ellipse, working my BlackBerry as I went, and it was beautiful, spectacular.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why I\xe2\x80\x99m in such a good mood.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- recognize you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I put on a beard and some sunglasses.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Autographs?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, unmolested.\xc2\xa0 So before I take your questions -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair word.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I have a couple of announcements.\xc2\xa0 Settle in.</p>\n<p>Before departing for Los Angeles, President Obama will deliver a statement in San Jose on Friday morning about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act for working Californians and all Americans.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll highlight the promising news that despite dire predictions, early data on insurance competition and premiums in the state show that ACA, the Affordable Care Act, is creating quality, affordable choices for Californians who plan to buy insurance this fall.</p>\n<p>California is the largest state, with the biggest insurance market in the country.\xc2\xa0 And with nearly 6 million uninsured, the state is also a critical part of the effort to sign up Americans for insurance.\xc2\xa0 More details on his statement will be released as they become available.</p>\n<p>Second announcement.\xc2\xa0 As part of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s all-of-the-above energy strategy to continue to expand domestic energy production, earlier today, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell announced that the administration will hold the first ever competitive lease sale for renewable energy on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.\xc2\xa0 The auction, scheduled to take place on July 31st, will offer 164,750 acres offshore off of Rhode Island and Massachusetts for commercial wind energy leasing.\xc2\xa0 The announcement comes on the heels of the Interior Department\xe2\x80\x99s approval yesterday of three major renewable energy projects in Nevada and Arizona, which, when built, are expected to deliver up to 520 megawatts to the electricity grid, enough to power nearly 200,000 homes.</p>\n<p>Since 2009, Interior has approved 25 utility-scale solar facilities, 9 wind farms, and 11 geothermal plants with associated transmission corridors and infrastructure to connect to established power grids.\xc2\xa0 When built, these projects could provide more than 12,500 megawatts of power, or enough electricity to power more than 4.4 million homes and support an estimated 17,000 construction and operation jobs.</p>\n<p>All of these efforts support the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to expanding American-made energy, including increasing renewable energy production, which doubled in the President\xe2\x80\x99s first term.</p>\n<p>In April, the Department announced that it will hold a 21 million-acre offshore oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, which builds on the 39 million-acre sale held in March and 20 million-acre sale held last November.</p>\n<p>Domestic oil and gas production has grown each year that President Obama has been in office, with domestic oil production currently higher than at any time in two decades.\xc2\xa0 Again, domestic oil production is currently higher than at any time in two decades.\xc2\xa0 Natural gas production is at its highest level ever.\xc2\xa0 And renewable electricity generation from wind, solar and geothermal sources have doubled.</p>\n<p>Combined with recent declines in oil consumption, foreign oil imports now account for less than 40 percent of the oil consumed in America, the lowest level since 1988.\xc2\xa0 That\'s announcement two.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Actually, the third one isn\'t really an announcement, but I hope some of you were up early enough to get our press release that we sent out where the President announced that he is taking five executive actions and making seven legislative proposals to address the problem caused by certain patent-holding firms who abuse the patent system -- clog it with litigation, disrupt innovation and competition.\xc2\xa0 Some people, their detractors call those firms "patent trolls" and so do we, which is why we believe that innovation and not litigation is the way to go when it comes to patent trolls.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looks like E.T.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it does a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Remember those pencils with the troll hair?\xc2\xa0 With that, I\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Darlene.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You should go for a walk more often.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll tell you, there are days when I come in the morning and I leave in the evening and I realize that I never left the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 We all need to walk more.\xc2\xa0 There was that great article in The New Yorker about treadmill desks.\xc2\xa0 Did anybody see that?\xc2\xa0 It seems a little risky, right?\xc2\xa0 But I was thinking --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could have one up there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Walking is a good thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Sorry, Darlene, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction to the reports in Paris with the French Foreign Minister saying that tests confirm that sarin gas was used in Syria multiple times?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you about that is that we have worked very closely with the French, as well as other allies, as well as the Syrian opposition, to build on the information that we had developed about the likely use of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work with the French and the British and others, and the Syrian opposition to do that.\xc2\xa0 I would note that the French report that you\'re citing says that more work needs to be done to establish who was responsible for the use and the amount that was used and more details about the circumstances around it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is of course what we said when we made that letter available that was sent to members of the Senate, discussing the information that we had and that we need to build on as we investigate the likely chemical weapons use in Syria.\xc2\xa0 As the President made clear, we need to expand the evidence we have.\xc2\xa0 We need to make it reviewable.\xc2\xa0 We need to have it corroborated before we make any decisions based on the clear violation the use of chemical weapons would represent by the Syrian regime.\xc2\xa0 So we will continue in that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a U.N. report today along the same lines.\xc2\xa0 How much longer before the U.S. will be able to say definitively whether Assad -- whether it believes Assad has used --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for you, but we are working very assiduously on this issue with our allies, with the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have been pressing for the United Nations investigation team to be allowed into Syria to pursue that investigation into the possible use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 President Assad has, having called for that investigation, has consistently blocked and not allowed -- blocked the investigation and not allowed investigators in.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to press for that.</p>\n<p>But we are not relying on the United Nations alone.\xc2\xa0 We are aggressively pursuing other avenues to gather the evidence that is required here.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that we are working very diligently as an administration with our allies and the Syrian opposition on this matter.</p>\n<p>We would note that, as the U.S. delegation to the Human Rights Council said yesterday in their statement, that we agree with the inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s expression of serious concern for the unacceptable levels of violence being perpetrated against the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that we are deeply concerned by the continued fighting in Qusayr and condemn the indiscriminate killing of civilians by Assad\'s forces and his proxies, including Hezbollah fighters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The regime\'s siege of Qusayr has created a dire humanitarian situation with severe shortages of food, water, and medicine.\xc2\xa0 We are appalled by the regime\'s statement that they will not allow the international committee of the Red Cross to enter Qusayr to aid trapped civilians until its military operations are completed.</p>\n<p>We call upon the Syrian government to cease its siege and its attacks on civilians; to allow civilians to escape Qusayr without the threat of violence; and to allow immediate and unimpeded access for all humanitarian actors and supplies into Qusayr.</p>\n<p>We are also concerned about the spillover violence into Lebanon, which we\'ve discussed in the past, and which highlights the risk of regional instability from Hezbollah\'s intervention on behalf of the Assad regime -- an intervention both Hassan Nasrallah and Bashar al-Assad have acknowledged publicly.\xc2\xa0 Hassan Nasrallah is risking Lebanon\'s stability and the security of the Lebanese people in order to preserve Bashar al-Assad\'s rule, and we condemn in the strongest terms the active role Hezbollah has taken in the fighting on behalf of the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>We reaffirm our support for Lebanon\'s policy of disassociation from the conflict in Syria, and urge all parties to avoid actions that will involve the Lebanese people in the conflict.</p>\n<p>Yes, Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just following up on Darlene\'s question.\xc2\xa0 Do these two statements or reports of evidence, actual evidence of toxic weapons, inconclusive though they may be, raise the U.S. concerns about what\'s going on there in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think they affirm the concerns that we\'ve expressed.\xc2\xa0 They affirm the evidence that we have already gathered and noted to the Senate and to the public.\xc2\xa0 And they make clear the need to investigate further and to gather more evidence to corroborate the evidence that exists that chemical weapons have been used; to pin down when those weapons were used, by whom, what the chain of custody was; and to establish a body of information that can be presented and reviewed, and upon which policy decisions can be made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About Turkey -- Turkey\'s Deputy Prime Minister recently said the crackdown on the protests have been excessive and unfair.\xc2\xa0 He apologized to the protestors.\xc2\xa0 Can you say, were there discussions between the administration, the United States and Turkey in this regard, and that may have swayed these comments which differ from those of the Prime Minister recently?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s useful to check with the State Department on conversations that may have been held between State Department officials and the Turkish government.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to suggest that there were.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that, as I did I think yesterday, that I have no conversations from the White House to report.\xc2\xa0 But we are obviously in regular contact with the Turkish government on a range of issues, and we have made clear our concerns about the excessive use of force that has been reported and had called on all sides to refrain from provoking violence.\xc2\xa0 And we noted, obviously, the comments by the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the more conciliatory comments suggest a lowering of the temperature, in a way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we hope that, as we have made clear, that the Turkish government will handle this in a way that respects the rights of free speech and assembly that are elemental to democracies.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome the Deputy Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s comments apologizing for excessive force, and we continue to welcome calls for these events to be investigated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different topic altogether.\xc2\xa0 The event just now in the Rose Garden on the judges, the President seemed heated when he was talking about obstacles facing judicial nominees.\xc2\xa0 What did he hope to accomplish by expressing his frustration in public?\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to shame Congress into -- by making an appeal to the court of public opinion on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President spoke today because this is an issue that is vital to the carrying out of justice in our system of government.\xc2\xa0 We need judges nominated and confirmed to our courts.\xc2\xa0 And, as the President made clear, his nominees have been subjected to political obstruction repeatedly. \xc2\xa0The duration from nomination [Committee approval] to confirmation is three times greater in his presidency than it was in his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s.*\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He also made clear that both parties have practiced the slowing down of this process in the past, but it is irrefutable that this situation has gotten out of control, that it is one that some have called a crisis.\xc2\xa0 And it has to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 I mean, every one of his nominees, once they overcome the obstacles, have been confirmed.\xc2\xa0 These are highly qualified nominees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The case of Caitlin Halligan is unconscionable.\xc2\xa0 She was an enormously qualified nominee.\xc2\xa0 The President is pleased by the confirmation, the overwhelming confirmation of Sri Srinivasan.\xc2\xa0 But there are still three vacancies on that court.\xc2\xa0 And the argument being made that the workload has been reduced and therefore we should eliminate some of the seats on that court is spurious on its face.\xc2\xa0 The caseload is higher now than it was 2005 when some of the same Republican senators were arguing for the necessity of confirming President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s nominees to that court.</p>\n<p>There are other courts where some of the same Republican senators have urged for and voted for the confirmation of judges that have a lower caseload than the D.C. Circuit.\xc2\xa0 This is politics.\xc2\xa0 And it is not helpful to the carrying out of the constitutional responsibilities that the President has or that the Senate has.\xc2\xa0 The President is doing his job.\xc2\xa0 He is nominating qualified candidates for these judicial posts.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has to do its job, which is to consider and vote yes or no on those nominees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And while the progress I noted for one seat on this court was welcome, we have a long way to go before this Senate, Republicans in the Senate, demonstrate a willingness to fulfill their constitutional responsibility in the way that they were meant to fulfill it, which is efficiently.\xc2\xa0 The Constitution doesn\'t say advise and consent over two years after a nomination is put forward of a highly qualified individual.\xc2\xa0 These need to be acted on quickly.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even some liberal advocacy groups have been critical of the President for being slow to name judges, especially at the district court level.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\'t the President share at least some responsibility for the delay in filling vacancies in the court?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees have been qualified, have been supported on a bipartisan basis from the legal community and by individuals who have served in administrations both Republican and Democratic.\xc2\xa0 The facts are clear that when we have these nominations put forward, some of them are delayed for months and sometimes years, and it is unconscionable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then we have a situation where whatever the reason was, whatever the political reason that was behind the obstruction is removed, then that nominee is suddenly confirmed overwhelmingly.\xc2\xa0 So clearly there was never a problem fundamentally with the nominee and his or her qualifications.</p>\n<p>The fact is the President had a nominee, Caitlin Halligan, to this court, and she was blocked, as the President noted, for an unconscionably long period of time.\xc2\xa0 And he is fulfilling his responsibility by nominating qualified individuals to these posts, and the Senate has clearly taken more than its time in considering these nominations.\xc2\xa0 And it needs to act, and that\'s why the President nominated three more candidates for the D.C. Circuit Court -- D.C. District Court, rather -- sorry, D.C. Circuit Court in hopes that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is commonly known as the D.C. Circuit, which is how I always refer to it.\xc2\xa0 But those slots have been open for years.\xc2\xa0 When Sri Srinivasan was confirmed, that was to a seat that hadn\'t been filled since Chief Justice John Roberts left the court in 2005.\xc2\xa0 So we need action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you say, those slots have been open for years.\xc2\xa0 And you said filling them is vital to carrying out our system of government.\xc2\xa0 So why is he doing this now, not sooner?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has nominated candidates in the past for a variety of judicial posts, and they have -- I mean, the record is clear in terms of the -- when he nominates qualified individuals and they take three times as long to be considered by the Senate, that slows the whole system down.\xc2\xa0 And there is no justifiable reason for it.\xc2\xa0 The rather remarkable statements by some senators about wanting to basically court-pack in reverse by what was essential that these posts be filled, that these seats be filled under a Republican President, because of the workload.\xc2\xa0 Now the workload is actually the same, or in many cases, greater than it was then -- suddenly, we can eliminate those seats because there is a Democratic President nominating highly qualified candidates.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s nakedly political, so we need to get on about the business of considering these nominees.\xc2\xa0 If senators oppose them for substantive reasons, they should vote against them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how the process is supposed to work.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, of course the President said the use of chemical weapons in Syria is a red line, a game changer.\xc2\xa0 Now with more evidence that chemical weapons were used in Syria, what is the President going to do about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you heard the President say, Jon, he wants to be sure that we have collected not just the evidence that we had when we talked about this earlier and that was discussed in the letter to the senators.\xc2\xa0 We need more and we need to build on it.\xc2\xa0 We need to establish chain of custody.\xc2\xa0 We need to establish the incidents themselves of the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we need to be able to have the kind of evidence that can be corroborated and reviewed if we are going to make policy decisions based on the assertion that chemical weapons were used by the Bashar al-Assad regime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you come to the same conclusion after gathering all that evidence that the U.N. has and that others have, what does the President do about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the U.N. report said that there are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical weapons have been used.\xc2\xa0 We have already said that there are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical weapons have been used.\xc2\xa0 The French announcement today is entirely consistent with what we said a number of weeks ago, that there is evidence that exists that established reasonable grounds that chemical weapons have been used.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear that we believe that if chemical weapons were in fact used in Syria, they were used by the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We are highly skeptical of claims that the opposition used chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 The chemical weapons in Syria we believe have been and remain under the control of the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>But we need more information.\xc2\xa0 Others have said, and I think it is worth noting, that the case for Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction was stronger than the case initially presented for the use of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it is essential and I think the American people expect that we take that evidence and we build on it and we build on it until we know what we have and we can present it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is insisting we do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, what I\'m asking is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What he will do once --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what he will do if he is convinced that red line has been crossed.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will be the one to make that announcement when he decides on action to be taken, if action is to be taken, if we establish the evidence necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But action will be taken if you are convinced that the red line was crossed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made clear that he would consider the use of chemical weapons by Assad, by his regime, to be a game changer to basically -- well, a game changer is the phrase he used, but that this would be cause for an evaluation -- a reevaluation of our policy options.</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific choices.\xc2\xa0 I have said all along, as he has and others, that we retain every option available to us to address this situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly the case today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another subject.\xc2\xa0 The President -- two veto threats that were issued yesterday on the Veterans appropriations bill and Homeland Security appropriations bill, and seems like will do this for all the appropriations bills based on if I\xe2\x80\x99m reading it correctly.\xc2\xa0 Is the President threatening a government shutdown if the Republicans don\'t come his way on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is making clear that Republicans need to keep their commitments based on the agreements of the past about spending levels.\xc2\xa0 And it is not acceptable to change those levels in a way that does inordinate harm to average Americans out there when there is a refusal by the Republicans thus far to agree to the basic principle that we should be able to find common ground if everybody is willing to compromise a little bit when it comes to deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>So I think you\xe2\x80\x99re over-interpreting this.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the statements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made about these appropriations bills are clear, and I think they reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that Republicans need to honor the commitments they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying if Republicans don\'t do that, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to veto the spending bills, which means there\xe2\x80\x99s a government shutdown, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re extrapolating in a hypothetical about outcomes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a veto threat for an appropriations bill.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that means --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 And to suggest that that immediately leads to a shutdown would leave out a great deal of how the legislative process works and has worked in the past.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re making clear our opposition --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you veto appropriations bills --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jon, we\xe2\x80\x99re making clear our opposition.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re predicting outcomes that aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily the case.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re saying is we need to honor the commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, and that\'s reflected in the statements of administration policy.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, statements of administration policy are for now the President is not interested in --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me -- Jon was asking me to predict the future of the outcomes of how Republicans in Congress will react to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked if he was threatening a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the answer is no.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he\xe2\x80\x99s not threatening a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s making very clear -- or the statement of administration policy and the views of his advisors is clearly stated, but it is not a broad statement about outcomes here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a statement about how we should responsibly fund our government in ways that keep the commitments that Congress has made in the past to the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about the Associated Press story today that described what it called a variety of senior administration officials possessing secret email addresses.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you a couple of questions about that.\xc2\xa0 One, what is the standard of transparency this administration is going to use in FOIA requests about these things, or in disclosing these going forward?\xc2\xa0 And is it -- or has it been the policy of this administration, whenever there is a congressional inquiry about email traffic on a given subject, that both the established email address and the secondary, or secret one, is always given over to Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s be clear -- this is a practice consistent with prior administrations of both parties, and, as the story itself made clear, any FOIA request or congressional inquiry includes a search in all of the email accounts used by any political appointee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the answer is, all of this information is provided.\xc2\xa0 Having alternate email addresses for Cabinet secretaries and other high-profile officials makes eminent sense, much as it does for columnists, for example, of major publications who provide email addresses for their readers but have alternate work email addresses so that if they are inundated in one account with either public emails or spam or the like, that they can continue to use their other account for normal work.\xc2\xa0 And that is the case with officials of this administration, officials of the previous administrations who have had email addresses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fundamental question here in terms of FOIA requests and congressional inquiries is that all of these email addresses are included.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you -- in mentioning previous administrations, the use of these alternate email addresses for political purposes did become a bedeviling --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no you\'re talking about private email accounts.\xc2\xa0 I am talking about work email accounts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what this article was talking about.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s not confuse this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is obviously counseled very clearly that we do not use and should not use private email accounts for work.\xc2\xa0 But this is an issue about alternate work email accounts, all of which are part of and are included in searches for FOIA requests and congressional inquiries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s nothing secretive about this.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\'s not secretive.\xc2\xa0 It\'s about having a public email address as well as a -- one for internal workings.\xc2\xa0 But they\'re all available when FOIA requests are made and congressional inquiries are conducted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the President is going to give remarks in California about the ACA.\xc2\xa0 I\'m curious if you were aware of a legislative effort in South Carolina to empower the Attorney General there to sue any business, including health insurers, if they in fact implement any of the President\'s health care law in that state, in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any general reaction to any state-level legislation of this kind which would operate outside of the litigious challenges to the law?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would hesitate to offer an opinion based on that except to say that we are very much about the business of implementing the Affordable Care Act, which has already provided benefits to millions of Americans -- whether it\'s the allowance to young Americans up to age 26 to remain on their parent\'s health insurance, or preventive free screenings for millions of Americans, assistance to seniors to pay their prescription bills.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are benefits that are already enjoyed because of the Affordable Care Act, and as we implement the bill further, millions more Americans will have access to insurance that they did not have before.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re very much focused on that, and progress on that continues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing on the D.C. Circuit.\xc2\xa0 In the context of Senate consideration of Sri Srinivasan\'s pending nomination, Majority Leader Harry Reid said there is a crisis on the D.C. Circuit, mentioning several opinions from that court that he disagreed with; I would imagine the administration also disagrees with.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe, and was one of the reasons for putting these three nominees up today, to address a crisis in not just the court itself its recent rulings that have either been disruptive to or displeasing to this administration.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that this court, which is commonly referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Highest Court in the Land,\xe2\x80\x9d should be fully staffed.\xc2\xa0 And that is a view consistent with the views of the very same senators who are suggesting we eliminate seats on this court to the views they held a few years ago when they were promoting the nominations of President Bush to this very court at a time when the workload was not dissimilar at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no crisis and no problem with the rulings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that every President is accorded by the Constitution the duty and responsibility to nominate judges, and he or she is obligated to nominate qualified individuals.\xc2\xa0 This President is fulfilling that duty.\xc2\xa0 The Senate needs to fulfill its duty in advising and consenting to these nominations, voting yes or no, but doing so in a responsible way and in a reasonable timeframe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the email story, since this is -- you suggest a routine practice throughout the administration, are there White House officials who have multiple email accounts as well then?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Ed, the White House, like Congress -- which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will be part of any story you do on this -- is not subject to FOIA.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not my question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the point is.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into people\xe2\x80\x99s individual email addresses, but I will simply say that it is -- let me tell you a story.\xc2\xa0 When Robert Gibbs came out here like a week before I started, and he mentioned my email address, I changed it so that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be inundated with -- and gave it to all of you -- but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be inundated with tons of emails and spam and the like.\xc2\xa0 So if that\'s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s actually my only email address, but it is not in the format that\'s traditional for the accounts here.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a very reasonable thing to do.</p>\n<p>And all I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that the issue here is -- are these accounts, these work accounts secret?\xc2\xa0 And the answer is, no, because they are subject to FOIA requests and they subject to congressional inquiry just like their public addresses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so when the Associated Press says -- because you make it sound very simple and that this is routine -- the Associated Press says they sent a FOIA three months ago asking for a list of these various accounts in different departments and agencies, and they got no response.\xc2\xa0 If this was kind of a routine thing, why was AP --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the agencies for specific FOIA requests.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that this administration has made significant strides in improving FOIA practices compared with all of our predecessors.\xc2\xa0 Agencies have improved their processes for administering the FOIA, disclosed more information, invoked FOIA exemptions less frequently, and answered more requests.</p>\n<p>Agencies are also increasingly disclosing information without waiting for a specific FOIA request, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a ton of data here to back up those statements.\xc2\xa0 And so I think our record on FOIA is -- compares favorably to every previous administration, and it reflects our efforts to be more transparent, to provide more information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question on Syria, to follow up on what was asked before.\xc2\xa0 I understand the reason that has been cited many times about getting it right in terms of actually having the evidence that chemical weapons were used.\xc2\xa0 But now when you have allies like France coming forward and saying they believe it was used, as more time passes, is there not a lessening behind the power of the President\xe2\x80\x99s words drawing a red line last summer?\xc2\xa0 If action does not back up those words, does that not send a signal around the world that he has not followed up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s highly important to get this right, and that the American people would expect the President and Congress and military leadership and intelligence leadership to get this right.\xc2\xa0 And that is what he has instructed his team to do as they work with our allies and the Syrian opposition.</p>\n<p>This is a very serious matter, and it should be dealt with in a deliberate and serious manner.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on the conversation that happened in the Rose Garden earlier today, the President spent about as much time criticizing Republicans as he did lauding his own nominees that he was bringing forward today.\xc2\xa0 Acknowledging the past precedent that he acknowledged today that this has happened by Democrats and Republicans alike, how does the President hope that that helps move this conversation forward and doesn\'t just continue the same practices of the past? \xc2\xa0How does it help get more done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because not criticizing them has worked so effectively where they are now blocking nominees or obstructing nominees at a pace three times greater than under the previous administration?\xc2\xa0 I think that is a rhetorical question that answers itself.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- the point of the event was to both announce these nominations, but specifically to take issue with the really absurd statements of opposition to filling these seats that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from some Republicans -- absurd just on the facts that they are using to make their arguments and absurd within the broader context of the kind of slowdown that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen throughout President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s time in office.</p>\n<p>Again, this is a constitutional duty of the President and of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Basic stuff here.\xc2\xa0 Presidents nominate individuals to the bench.\xc2\xa0 They are obligated to nominate qualified individuals.\xc2\xa0 The nominees the President has put forward have been universally judged as highly qualified by the American Bar Association, by predecessors of Republican and Democratic administrations, by the experts in the legal field, across the board.\xc2\xa0 And yet, we have faced this obstructionism.\xc2\xa0 And it is a problem, and it is a problem that needs to be fixed.\xc2\xa0 And it is an opportunity for the Senate to demonstrate -- Republicans in the Senate to demonstrate that we can, even as we disagree on some matters, get about the business of fulfilling fundamental responsibilities, constitutional responsibilities.</p>\n<p>I could cite you statements by Senator Grassley and others that directly contradict what they\'re saying today, statements that were made when President Bush was in office about this specific court, about the caseload of this specific court.\xc2\xa0 So I think it makes clear that this is about politics.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that frustrates the American people about the way Washington works.\xc2\xa0 At the very least we ought to be able to get this done, because again and again, when the hurdle is clear and the obstacle is removed that has held up an individual nominee, that nominee is confirmed, which suggests that that nominee is qualified.\xc2\xa0 And usually, that nominee is confirmed overwhelmingly.</p>\n<p>So it certainly makes clear that that nominee, if he or she was qualified a year after being nominated, he or she was qualified three months after being nominated or six months after being nominated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s friend, as evidenced by the game of Touchdown Fever last week on the Jersey Shore, Governor Chris Christie is in the unique position of having to fill a Senate seat being now vacated by the loss of Senator Lautenberg.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position is in terms of what it thinks Governor Christie should do in terms of nominating a Democrat to follow a Democrat or whether it could be a Republican.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is a right reserved to the Governor, and obviously the Governor will exercise that right.\xc2\xa0 And we have no opinion on it.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to working with whomever Governor Christie puts in that position.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No opinion and no preference?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly not an opinion or preference to express publicly.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is something that -- any Jersey residents here want to put themselves forward?\xc2\xa0 This is obviously something that is a right reserved to the Governor and one that I\'m sure he will exercise.\xc2\xa0 And we will work with whomever he appoints.</p>\n<p>Phil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the D.C. Circuit Court nominees today, what was the motive behind nominating all three of them at once?\xc2\xa0 It seems like an unusual move?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the strategy there?\xc2\xa0 What does he hope, the President hope the Senate does?\xc2\xa0 Does he expect the Senate to take up all three of the nominees together and vote on them around the same time?\xc2\xa0 Or would he be satisfied if they were staggered?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, procedure in the Senate, strategy in the Senate we generally leave to Senator Reid and the Committee Chairman.\xc2\xa0 So I would ask you to raise that with them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President nominated these three individuals, because having successfully seen the confirmation of one enormously qualified nominee -- which was very welcome -- and having three nominees ready to be nominated for the three still unfilled seats to that court, the President decided that we would nominate them all together.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the -- if you look at the qualifications and backgrounds of the individuals he nominated today, I think you see in these three nominees a reflection of the high standards that the President has placed on all of his nominees and on the nomination process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are enormously qualified individuals, both legal scholarship on the bench and in practicing law -- both defense and prosecution, private and public.\xc2\xa0 They should be confirmed.\xc2\xa0 They are qualified and have support from Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 So the President hopes that, as he made clear today, that we can move beyond the sort of politics of this process and get about the business of seating highly qualified judges on this court.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, over a year ago when we learned the President would not sign an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from LGBT workplace discrimination, advocates were told that the White House would instead commission a study of LGBT workplace discrimination possibly led by the Council of Economic Advisors.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could give us any status or update on that study.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updated status on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President has long supported, as you know, an inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA.\xc2\xa0 And his administration will continue to work to build support for it.\xc2\xa0 And we welcomed Chairman Harkin\'s announcement that he will vote -- hold a vote, rather, on ENDA this year.\xc2\xa0 And that remains our position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any details about the study?\xc2\xa0 Who\'s leading it, when it might be released, or anything like that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last follow-up.\xc2\xa0 On this issue, people are becoming a little disheartened with the White House.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to those who look at this answer from you today and are discouraged or say, if you want an issue to go away in Washington, you commission a study?\xc2\xa0 What\'s your response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President\'s record on support for LGBT rights is significant and well known.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the right approach to this problem is an inclusive piece of legislation, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that we\'re taking.\xc2\xa0 It was the approach that we took with repeal of "don\'t ask, don\'t tell".\xc2\xa0 And we continue to support this effort.\xc2\xa0 We welcome Chairman Harkin\'s steps in the direction of holding a vote on this.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the position that we think is right, strategically, when it comes to making this happen.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Back to Turkey.\xc2\xa0 Do you think the unrest in Turkey will affect the long-term political, economic relation between U.S. and Turkey?\xc2\xa0 Or is this just a minor bump in the road?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve made clear our concern about the reports of the use of excessive force, and we welcome the comments by the Deputy Prime Minister about -- that apologized for that excessive force.\xc2\xa0 We call on all parties to refrain from provoking violence, and we continue to make known our opinion that these events should be investigated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have a very important relationship with Turkey.\xc2\xa0 Turkey is a NATO ally.\xc2\xa0 We are working with Turkey on a range of regional issues that are obviously of great importance to U.S. national security and to regional security, and we will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You addressed this a little bit yesterday, but the IRS IG report came out this morning on wasteful spending.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen it now?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any other comments on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen it.\xc2\xa0 I would refer to the comments made by the acting -- the new acting commissioner of the IRS, making clear that the conference in question is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era; that the actions that have been taken to rein in this kind of activity have resulted in a drop in travel and training expenses of more than 80 percent since 2010.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I cited yesterday and won\'t take time doing it again today the actions the administration has taken overall to deal with this in keeping with the President\'s strict mandate that we all have to be careful stewards of the taxpayer dollar.\xc2\xa0 And he does not have tolerance for waste of taxpayer money.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was evidenced in his response to the GSA report and in response to this.</p>\n<p>All the way in the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Rubio said today that the immigration reforms lack 60 votes from the Senate.\xc2\xa0 My question is, has the President been working lately on the phone, twisting arms on Capitol Hill about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been working very hard on this matter.\xc2\xa0 He has had numerous conversations with lawmakers of both parties.\xc2\xa0 We remain encouraged by the progress being made in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the bill that emerged from committee is in keeping with the principles the President outlined two years ago now when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But there is much work that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'m not counting votes right now.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to Senate leaders for that.\xc2\xa0 But we look forward to the bill moving to the floor, to a healthy debate, and to passage of comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate with bipartisan support that reflects the principles the President has long espoused.\xc2\xa0 It will not be everything that the President would want.\xc2\xa0 It will not be written exactly the way he would write it.\xc2\xa0 But I think that would be true of every strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, whether that supporter is a member of the Gang of Eight or someone who is not even in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 It won\'t be exactly what everyone wants.\xc2\xa0 It can\'t be, because it will have, hopefully, broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 But it will be, we hope, in keeping with the President\'s principles.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to press you on Syria again.\xc2\xa0 So if this U.N. report is implicating the rebels in using chemical weapons, you seem to be vague about how you\'re going to deal with the Syrian government.\xc2\xa0 How are you going to hold the rebels accountable if they use chemical weapons?\xc2\xa0 And, on Turkey --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wait, the U.N. report doesn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. report says that there are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical weapons have been used.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- reports that are implicating the rebels as well.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not just the government.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that was a statement from a number of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s reflected in today\'s report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then how are you going to hold them responsible?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do not believe it is -- we are very skeptical of the suggestion that chemical weapons that we believe have been in the control of the Assad regime were used by the opposition.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we are gathering facts.\xc2\xa0 We are gathering evidence rather than making assumptions.\xc2\xa0 But it is fair to say that we are skeptical of suggestions that the opposition has used chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just on Turkey, please.\xc2\xa0 If you are concerned about what\'s happening in Turkey, why are you raising it on the ambassador level only and not on the level with the Secretary of State or the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d refer you to the State Department for conversations that we have with our counterparts in the Turkish government all the time.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have any conversations to report to you from the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to find out a little bit of the tick-tock on how the President comes to and how the White House comes to nominate these three.\xc2\xa0 Talk to us about the lists that are compiled for these judge nominations, these court nominations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a great deal of tick-tock to provide to you.\xc2\xa0 When there are openings on courts, a process is in place to look at any number of potential candidates to fill these posts, and then a selection process is undertaken and potential nominees are presented to the President for consideration.\xc2\xa0 And he makes a decision about who he wants to nominate for these posts.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not dissimilar from the process of administration posts that are filled through nominations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is a little different because of the nature of these judicial posts.\xc2\xa0 But in its basic sense, it\'s not dissimilar.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it similar somewhat to the Supreme Court, the way that you pull together the list for Supreme Court -- is it something along that line?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I personally haven\'t participated in one of these selection processes, but I think it\'s fair to say that it mirrors that to some degree.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court, and seats to that court do not open up that frequently.\xc2\xa0 So there is a probably more intense level of consideration in that process.\xc2\xa0 But for this court, let\'s be clear -- this is a court that is commonly viewed as and considered the \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Highest Court in the Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This is an extraordinarily important court that decides cases that affect every American.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it\'s important to have it fully staffed with highly qualified judges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So since this court is so important, were these names already on the list or was there a list already?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a lot of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because for the Supreme Court, we know when you walked in the door there was a list; there was a standing list already of some names.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s what people assume in the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we were told --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t have a lot of insight to provide to you about the sort of internal process of selecting nominees for this court, except that it\'s rigorous and the threshold is candidates who are extremely qualified.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, some veterans groups are getting pretty upset about the backlog in the processing of disability claims.\xc2\xa0 One group told us it\'s time for the President to step up and get more personally involved in the process of reducing that backlog.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House plan any new initiatives on that, or have you done all you can?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we believe very strongly that this is something that requires commitment and dedication every day.\xc2\xa0 The President is deadly serious about the need to deal with this problem.\xc2\xa0 He\'s made clear that he expects results.\xc2\xa0 Too many veterans are waiting far too long to receive the benefits that they have earned and deserve, and it\'s unacceptable.</p>\n<p>He\'s directed -- the President has -- Secretary Shinseki to fix the problem and to eliminate the backlog by 2015.\xc2\xa0 And again, he is clear that he expects results.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and as Denis McDonough, the Chief of Staff, said in April, this is a national priority -- at least that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\'s considered in this White House, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been made clear administration-wide.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s something that is -- the efforts to address and deal with the backlog are monitored regularly here at the White House because this is a very high priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to go back to Syria.\xc2\xa0 It\'s 8:00 p.m. at this moment in Paris, and the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, is on the evening news, and he\'s suggesting that for the French the red line has been crossed.\xc2\xa0 Do you support the French position?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Laura, I\'ve answered this question in several different ways.\xc2\xa0 The report I read is that the French believe that there are grounds to suggest that chemical weapons have been used but that more evidence needs to be gathered, which is exactly the position that this administration holds.\xc2\xa0 And we work very closely with the French and the British and others, as well as, importantly, the Syrian opposition, in gathering evidence and corroborating evidence, and reviewing it, and making sure that we have hard facts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And our partnership with the French on this is very close, so we will continue to work with the French, the British, the opposition and others as we gather the evidence that we believe we need to gather as we consider our options, policy-wise, in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But officially, the French are saying that they have evidence tonight.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point you to reports and the fact that they said that more evidence needs to be gathered about who used the weapons, where they were specifically used.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the position that we enunciated a number of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The patent troll executive actions -- is that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Troll -- really?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hold it up again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that, April?\xc2\xa0 Innovation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that a White House graphic?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Innovation -- yes, we had somebody draw it.\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s innovation, not litigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I wanted one of those troll pencils to bring out, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t have them at CVS.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is this related to the President\'s Silicon Valley fundraiser on Thursday night?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President addressed this, as you know, earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 This is a big problem, and it stifles innovation, and it is something that we need to deal with because there are these firms out there that exist primarily to get licensing fees and other -- by gumming up the process through litigation.\xc2\xa0 And it does great harm.\xc2\xa0 It costs, I think, $29 billion in direct costs, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.</p>\n<p>We are blessed in this country because of our system and our economy and the quality of our universities and the quality of the people who work in fields of innovation that we are constantly on the cutting edge.\xc2\xa0 We need to stay there.\xc2\xa0 And patent trolls are, through what they do, making it harder and harder to stay there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President announced the executive actions that he is taking and the legislative proposals that he\'s putting forward because we have to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very important to our economy.\xc2\xa0 Everybody here knows that innovation in the fields of technology in particular is vital to future economic growth.</p>\n<p>And so this is -- the troll is a funny way to get people\'s attention, but it\'s an extremely important economic problem.</p>\n<p>Thanks, all.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:07 P.M.
