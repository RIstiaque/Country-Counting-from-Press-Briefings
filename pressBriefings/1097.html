CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How\xe2\x80\x99s everyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to be with you today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I love you guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which one of us do you love most?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that a Sophie\xe2\x80\x99s choice?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 No more film analogies today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, as you know, President Obama is traveling to Holland, Michigan, to tour the Johnson Controls, Inc., advanced battery facility.\xc2\xa0 While at Johnson Controls, the President will highlight the key role innovative technologies will play in helping automakers achieve the historic fuel economy standards, establishing U.S. leadership in advanced vehicle manufacturing, spurring economic growth and creating high-quality domestic jobs in cutting-edge industries across America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously from our handout.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll also read this from an article that I liked this morning.\xc2\xa0 It says, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who actually care about what Presidents do might be interested in Obama\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Michigan on Thursday.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This is a quote.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s visiting a factory that builds batteries for electric vehicles, a factory that exists for three reasons:\xc2\xa0 one, because President Obama saved the U.S. auto industry; two, because President Obama has ratcheted up fuel efficiency standards, boosting demand for green vehicles; three, because President Obama created a U.S. advanced battery industry from scratch.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is that from?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Time Magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point is -- I mean, obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s the opinion of one journalist who focuses on these issues -- is that the President today is focusing on something, an industry and a strategy that he has pursued as President that is focused on building our economic future.\xc2\xa0 And our economic future depends on us building industries that -- in which we can be highly competitive, important industries like clean energy that will allow us to -- or auto industry, for example -- to hopefully dominate the 21st century the way it dominated so much of the 20th century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he feels very strongly that we have to build a foundation for the kind of economic growth and job creation for the future through the kinds of investments that this administration has made in its first two and a half years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I will take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, is the President moving any closer to explicitly calling for President Assad to leave office?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been extremely clear about our feelings, our position on President Assad, what he\xe2\x80\x99s been perpetrating on his people, the fact that Syria would be a much better place without him; that he has lost his legitimacy, and now long since lost his opportunity to lead the transition that the Syrian people are demanding take place. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have acted aggressively to isolate the Syrian government and figures within it through financial measures.\xc2\xa0 We continue to ratchet up the pressure on the Syrian regime, on the Assad regime with our international partners, as I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of anything else right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S., in fact -- I saw an article today -- preparing for the eventuality of civil war in Syria?\xc2\xa0 What do those preparations entail?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that a transition needs to take place in Syria, and that Syria will be better off without President Assad.\xc2\xa0 And we support those who are seeking a peaceful transition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That is why the Secretary of State met with Syrian oppositionists last week, why Ambassador Ford is on the ground in Syria and has traveled, as you know, to Hama, one of the areas where there\xe2\x80\x99s been the greatest number of protests and crackdowns, and why we are working so aggressively with our international partners to put pressure on President Assad to get him to stop brutalizing his own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the administration about open sectarian war in Syria?\xc2\xa0 Is that part of the reason why --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just the question I answered, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That was pretty much my answer.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just, again, spelling out what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done, why we believe that President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to lead the transition has passed, why we believe Syria would be a better place without him, why we support those in Syria who are seeking a peaceful transition to a more democratic and brighter future in Syria -- the actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, including the Secretary of State meeting with Syrian oppositionists last week, having Ambassador Ford on the ground in Syria, where he has met, as you know, in Hama, with the opposition and witnessed what\'s going on there, and why we continue to put pressure, working collectively with our international partners, on Syria. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President still has not explicitly called on President Assad to step aside.\xc2\xa0 Is that because at the end of the day, once he does that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve used up all our leverage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear what our position is on President Assad and the fact that Syria would be better off without him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CEOs meeting tomorrow -- can you tell us anything more today about that meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just that it will be a small group of CEOs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about the attendees.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that in the past on the day of the meetings.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about that.\xc2\xa0 He wants to discuss the economy, the industries that the business leaders represent, and what they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing and seeing, and ideas they have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About a half a dozen or so -- when you say a small group, is that about right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roughly accurate, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a final count right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cross-section of sectors and industries or some one specific niche?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It will be diverse.\xc2\xa0 A small and diverse group.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us about conversations that are taking place between the White House and officials in Europe about the debt situation there and how much concern is there that there might be a spillover with big effects in the global economy from this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that some of the turbulence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen here in the United States has been due to the -- some of the economic headwinds emanating from Europe. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, the President has made -- has been in contact over the last several days with the German Chancellor, the French President, the Spanish President, the Italian Prime Minister and the -- and Prime Minister Cameron of Great Britain.\xc2\xa0 And obviously Secretary Geithner has been and is in regular contact with his counterparts in Europe. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe that Europe and Europeans -- Europe\xe2\x80\x99s institutions have the capacity to handle this situation, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to monitor it, obviously, very closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the speech tonight -- or today -- is that enough to convince Americans he has a jobs plan?\xc2\xa0 There was a poll out today from The Washington Post showing only a third of Americans now think the President has leadership on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Is today\xe2\x80\x99s speech going to be enough to turn that around?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very aware of the fact that Americans feel economic uncertainty as we continue to emerge from the greatest recession -- the worst recession since the Great Depression, and growth has not been fast enough and job creation not been significant enough by our standards and by any standard, as far as we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, which is why this President is so focused on and has been focused on doing everything we can to -- and that he can to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 You have heard him in recent weeks talk -- the fact is we do have a divided government, but he has talked very explicitly about the measures that this Congress could take and very easily pass because they have bipartisan support -- and have had bipartisan support in the past, including passage of free trade agreements, passage of patent reform, infrastructure fund -- ideas for creating an infrastructure fund where we could leverage a relatively small amount of public money to put private companies to work, hiring out-of-work construction workers to build our infrastructure --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- new proposals, concrete --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can be sure -- you can be sure that the President is working on -- working with his economic team every day, and that they are constantly evaluating new proposals and different ways to -- different ideas for growing the economy and creating jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the Israeli approval of 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem going to make it more difficult for the White House to convince the Palestinians not to seek recognition at the U.N. next month?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think our position on that has always -- has not changed, which is that we obviously urge both sides not to take any action that makes it harder for the two sides to come together and negotiate.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, he used to do these events almost weekly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been months since he\xe2\x80\x99s been out for an event like this.\xc2\xa0 Can you just talk about his mood going into this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that he is absolutely looking forward to this trip today and to the bus tour next week -- for three days through the Midwest -- because, as you say, he has been pretty much full-time in Washington for a sustained period of time as he has dealt with Congress on the debt ceiling negotiations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s really important to get out and talk with Americans from around the country and hear what they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing and feeling about the economy, hear their ideas, explain to them what his views are, his principles, the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing -- why, for example, today, that the measures that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to help grow this vital area of the economy and clean energy are so important.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s really -- he\xe2\x80\x99s in a great mood.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the other two stops on the bus tour?\xc2\xa0 Only Iowa has been announced.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the Minnesota stop and the Illinois stop?\xc2\xa0 Do you have that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been announced.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it for you, sorry.\xc2\xa0 I actually -- I would probably get it wrong.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have that for you soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have any thoughts on Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s approach toward S&amp;P reported today?\xc2\xa0 And also, any words about Iowa tonight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about those two subjects.\xc2\xa0 I did note with some interest that report that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- speaking not for the President, but I think in general, that what I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about is whether or not anyone participating in the debate tonight will have any concrete proposals for growing the economy and creating jobs that aren\xe2\x80\x99t retread ideas that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work in the past.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one of the -- going back to what the President is doing today, the investments that this administration made to help undergird an advanced battery market in this country that we can be highly competitive in is a concrete step that has resulted in a growing segment of the economy and the creation of real jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how America is going to win the future.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how America is going to be globally competitive.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried a lot of ideas in the past, including just giving very large tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, and that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out so well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s only about 75 jobs created from the Recovery Act investment there in Holland, and how many millions of Americans out of work.\xc2\xa0 How would you make the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming the President would want to make the case that a small number of jobs now would become a large number later, but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the amount of job creation overall, and clean energy has been -- this is one place, one factory worth highlighting because of its success and the importance in the industry.\xc2\xa0 And what I think has been obvious from the approach that President Obama has taken from the beginning is that you have to -- you have a multi-pronged approach to growing the economy and creating jobs, and it includes a variety of measures, including, in this case, our investments in clean energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s fundraisers in New York City, are you worried that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to send the wrong impression, that he\xe2\x80\x99s with these very wealthy people at a time when Main Street is especially hurting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that Americans understand that our political system functions the way it does, and that candidates have to raise money.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly expect that members of Congress are doing the same thing, as well as presidential candidates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 1:20 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
