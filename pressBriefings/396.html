EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard.\xc2\xa0 Are we ready?\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us on the trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This afternoon the President will hold a town hall at Cross Campus in Los Angeles where he will speak directly to millennials about how they\xe2\x80\x99re faring in our economy, and this administration\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding commitment to expanding opportunity for their generation, in part by creating good jobs and unleashing more startups and entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Specifically, the reason we are going to Cross Campus today is for one simple reason:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a shared workspace that fosters the kind of creativity and innovation that will help millennials continue to create good jobs, start new businesses, and unleash the next wave of great American economic growth.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On The Washington Post report today on the Secret Service, can you address whether the White House individual who was named in that report was involved in anything wrong, and whether the White House tried to cover that up?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth just taking a minute to review a lot of the facts here.\xc2\xa0 Because as most of you will remember, a lot of this was reported over two years ago.\xc2\xa0 In April of 2012, when the allegations first surfaced, the White House proactively initiated an internal review of the White House advance team that traveled to Colombia.\xc2\xa0 At that time, White House Counsel requested that the United States Secret Service send over any information related to White House personnel engaging in inappropriate conduct.</p>\n<p>As part of that review, a hotel record of a volunteer with the advance team was provided to the White House.\xc2\xa0 We considered this evidence, and found no other corroborating materials to suggest this volunteer engaged in inappropriate behavior.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s at least one other instance of a similar hotel log falsely implicating a Secret Service agent who was subsequently exonerated.</p>\n<p>The White House review, which took into account the information received from the Secret Service, concluded that there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been any misconduct by the White House team -- White House advance team.</p>\n<p>Now, in September of 2012, the acting DHS inspector general published the results of this investigation into the Cartagena incident.\xc2\xa0 The report, which was released, again, in September of 2012, discussed allegations regarding a White House advance volunteer.\xc2\xa0 And these were reported on extensively at the time, I believe, by many of you.</p>\n<p>Then, in April of 2014 -- that\xe2\x80\x99s six months ago now -- a bipartisan Senate investigation led by Senators Claire McCaskill and Ron Johnson concluded that changes made to the IG report were \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the ordinary process of editing the report,\xe2\x80\x9d and found that allegations that changes were made because they were embarrassing could not be substantiated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It almost sounds as though you all are saying faulty hotel records came into play here.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the hotel records were not correct -- the records that suggested that he brought someone to his hotel room?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That hotel log was examined as part of the White House review.\xc2\xa0 The White House review also talked to officials who were on the trip, talked to the individuals in question, examined contemporaneous materials, and found no corroborating evidence to that log.\xc2\xa0 In addition, we know that a very similar log falsely implicated a Secret Service agent who was subsequently exonerated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that same log?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that was at the same exact time?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Same exact?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Time.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the implication from this Post story is that it was some sort of election-year cover-up to protect a donor.\xc2\xa0 Could you address that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can, Steve.\xc2\xa0 And more than me addressing it, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to draw your attention to the bipartisan subcommittee report, again, chaired by Senators Claire McCaskill and Ron Johnson, who could not substantiate those allegations.\xc2\xa0 In fact, to the contrary, they found that changes were made to a draft of the IG report on Cartagena were \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the ordinary process of editing the report.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you speak a little bit to the discrepancy in how this White House staffer was investigated and how these Secret Service agents were investigated?\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post article said that some of those agents were subject to polygraph tests.\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same -- why weren\xe2\x80\x99t the same measures used on this White House staffer?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Kevin.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering that when the allegations of a White House staffer first surfaced, the White House Counsel immediately conducted an internal review that included interviews with the White House advance team, and looking at other materials, including contemporaneous accounts.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the White House Counsel had requested Secret Service to send over all information related to the White House personnel engaging in inappropriate conduct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Based on that careful review, which concluded the hotel log discussed by The Washington Post and many of your articles months ago -- based on that, the White House -- based on an absence of information corroborating that log, the White House Counsel concluded that there had been no misconduct by the White House advance team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the question is, did his volunteer status affect sort of the intensity with which the White House felt that it had to investigate?\xc2\xa0 And did his father\xe2\x80\x99s status as a donor have anything to do with either him being on that trip or how you treated him once there was a potential problem?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The second question you asked, the answer is no.\xc2\xa0 The first question you asked -- again, two years, three years ago now, when the White House initiated this review, it looked at any possible member of the White House team who may have been engaged in inappropriate conduct on the ground on that trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t investigate a volunteer the same way you would investigate, like, a senior advisor or a member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s protective detail.\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would tell you that we actually asked the Secret Service to send us any documents that implicated any White House officials on that trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is this article going to prompt you to review this again, look at it again, investigate it again?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that the review that was conducted several years ago now, again, looked at these allegations and found there was nothing to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Chaffetz is asking for documents related to the White House review on this.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that -- I mean, will the White House consider giving him what he\xe2\x80\x99s asking for, or turn over the documents?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw that request.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to you.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we do comply with all legitimate oversight requests, and I would point you to, again, the oversight that\xe2\x80\x99s been done heretofore on this, which was released by a bipartisan panel chaired by Senators Claire McCaskill and Ron Johnson, who found that changes made to the draft IG report on Cartagena were \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the ordinary process of editing that report.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Mr. Dach going to keep his job at State?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reasons that that status would change, is there?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department on any personnel, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you just real quickly also -- this has been brought up long before this anyway, but is there now consideration of moving Secret Service back under Treasury?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you guys have sort of taken a second look at?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the status of those discussions?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard any discussion of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President aware that there was a White House staffer under investigation at the time?\xc2\xa0 And was he satisfied with the investigation that you all completed?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I know that we have -- we stand by the review.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have information regarding sort of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visibility into this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kathy Ruemmler is obviously very involved in this, and she\xe2\x80\x99s also being discussed as a potential nominee for Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 Is this going to affect those deliberations about when -- who you would pick for the nominee and when that would happen?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Let me answer that a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 First, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about any potential candidates for the Attorney General slot.\xc2\xa0 As you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s a general rule that we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty strict about.</p>\n<p>On the matter of this White House review, we stand by it.\xc2\xa0 We thought it was conducted by White House Counsel -- Kathy -- in a careful, thorough way, as you -- anyone who knows Kathy knows that she\xe2\x80\x99s a former prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 She is a renowned attorney who is respected by members of both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no concern about this drawing attention to conduct that obviously is questionable to some people, given that she\xe2\x80\x99s in -- she might be in contention for something else?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address whether any particular individuals are in contention for any particular slots, but I would say that, again, the review was conducted in an aggressive, thoughtful and thorough way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How close are you to naming an AG nominee?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, that is a priority.\xc2\xa0 Attorney General Holder, over the past six years, has accomplished a lot.\xc2\xa0 It will be tough shoes to fill, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of work to be done.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to fill as soon as we can.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific updates for you on it though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the fundraisers on this trip, will you address why some of them are open to the media and some of them are closed?\xc2\xa0 How was that decided?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I could speculate on your interest on some of them, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Darlene, as you know, all of the events on this trip are in accordance with the sort of established guidelines that we\xe2\x80\x99ve used over the past six years.\xc2\xa0 Those guidelines include increased access for the first time to fundraisers at private homes where the President is giving remarks.\xc2\xa0 And because of our commitment to transparency and because of our opening of those to press access, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to hear those remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to go into the ones that are described as roundtables.\xc2\xa0 So what does he do there?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are they so secret?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, again, these access questions are all consistent with how we\xe2\x80\x99ve handled this in the past for the past six years.\xc2\xa0 As you know, when the President gives prepared remarks, even at a private home, for the first time, the press has access to them.\xc2\xa0 When there are no prepared remarks and it\xe2\x80\x99s more of an informal discussion, we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s more conducive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President met Gwyneth Paltrow before?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like -- has she been a supporter of his in the past?\xc2\xa0 And does she represent millennials do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, I had not anticipated that question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does he think of \xe2\x80\x9cShakespeare in Love\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I vowed I would not speak in the third person in this gaggle, but I can tell you I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met Gwyneth Paltrow before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the millennials event today, how much is this event about getting young people to vote in the midterm elections?\xc2\xa0 Those contests aren\xe2\x80\x99t typically frequented by younger people.\xc2\xa0 Is the President specifically in his statement in the town hall today going to tell these people to go out and vote?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to look at what was in the report yesterday, which I encourage you to review thoroughly.\xc2\xa0 I think that what you saw were issues and a record from this administration of focusing on these issues for the past six years.</p>\n<p>So if you look at the top issues we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, it\xe2\x80\x99s job creation, wage growth; it is making college more affordable.\xc2\xa0 Those are issues that we have been talking about for the past six years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to tell them to go and vote in the midterm elections?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a preview of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks for you.\xc2\xa0 But again, I can tell you that this event is going to build on what you heard the President talk about last week -- some of you were fortunate enough to join us on that trip -- when he put forth his vision to continuing to build on the foundation we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid for a strong, durable economy with a secure middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The economy has been kind of tough on younger people, though, partly because they were entering the job market at a time when it was really hard to get a job.\xc2\xa0 So this was once like the President\xe2\x80\x99s most enthusiastic -- one of his most enthusiastic groups.\xc2\xa0 And they have sort of waned a bit.\xc2\xa0 Is he hoping that he can win them back over by talking about the things that he has done?\xc2\xa0 I mean he obviously -- if he thought he was going to hurt Democrats by talking to young people, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be out there talking to young people three weeks before an election.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s he kind of hoping to do -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a purely policy speech with no political implications?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this is a policy speech.\xc2\xa0 And the millennials, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve referenced, came of age -- some of us are included -- during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 In the face of those challenges, President Obama acted quickly to rebuild opportunity for all hardworking Americans, including millennials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there are still challenges to meet, and no generation has been better equipped to overcome them than millennials.\xc2\xa0 They\'re skilled with technology and more education than previous generations.\xc2\xa0 And like you said, there are still challenges to meet.\xc2\xa0 But I would point out that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, for example, the number of uninsured young Americans has dropped nearly 40 percent over the last four years.\xc2\xa0 And I also happen to know that unemployment is down by five percentage points for workers aged 18 to 34.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go to Syria?\xc2\xa0 I want to ask -- you want to ask?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, is it important with the speech last week and with what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be speaking about on this trip, does the President feel like his accomplishments have been lost, that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention to them, that he needs to assert them?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think, Isaac, you heard the President last week, at a speech that I was privileged to join, lay out both the record of this administration for the past six years and also talk about the challenges and opportunities we see moving forward, as well as the common-sense measures we can take.\xc2\xa0 So this is what drives the President day in and day out.\xc2\xa0 You can certainly expect to hear more from him on this moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he feel like people aren\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention to those accomplishments?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in the news, and there are certainly an array of international -- complicated international situations that have taken up a lot of attention, both in the press and by the American people, and by the President.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to say we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be also focused on the domestic economic challenges we face here at home.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How often will we see him or can we expect to see him out on the road trying to campaign through these remaining weeks before the election?\xc2\xa0 Once a week, twice a week, every day?\xc2\xa0 Weekends?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to steal the thunder for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s week ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you, because you asked, that on October 15th the President will travel to Bridgeport, Connecticut for a campaign rally with Connecticut Democrats, featuring Governor Dan Malloy.\xc2\xa0 Additional details will be made available in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how closely is the President tracking what\xe2\x80\x99s going in on Kobani?\xc2\xa0 Does he wish the Turks would get involved?\xc2\xa0 Apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s a Facebook message going on by the Kurds, urging the President to get more involved in protecting Kobani.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I admit, Steve, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to check Facebook today, but I will say we remain deeply concerned about the people of Kobani who are battling against ISIL terrorists.\xc2\xa0 We continue to conduct airstrikes in the Kobani area, including five strikes last night south of the city that damaged an ISIL training camp, destroyed an ISIL support building and destroyed two ISIL vehicles.\xc2\xa0 These strikes were, indeed, conducted as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>The destruction of targets in Syria and Iraq further limits this terrorist group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to lead, to control, to project power, and to conduct operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Turkey, should they be getting involved?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said a couple of times, ISIL is obviously a threat to Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there are few countries that have felt the ripple effect of this crisis as much as Turkey has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also said that Turkey has unique capabilities in a wide range of potential contributions that can play a very important role in the growing international effort to counter ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why General Allen is in Ankara today where he\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled to meet with leaders from the Syrian opposition, members of the Turkish government, and from NATO.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the expectations for that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview that at this time.\xc2\xa0 I can say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in constant discussion with our Turkish partners about the range of possible ways that Turkey can contribute to support the anti-ISIL coalition.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it to General Allen to continue those conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you feel the United States is doing all it can to help Kobani?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, we remain deeply concerned about the situation there, as we are always concerned with the welfare of those who are threatened by ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s inhumanity.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Defense Department read out information about airstrikes last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is the national security staffer that\'s traveling with the President on this trip?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Suzy George, the chief of staff for the National Security Staff.</p>\n<p>Are we good?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:19 P.M.
