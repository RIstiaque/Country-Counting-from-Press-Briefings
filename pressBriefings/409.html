EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to New York City where the President will spend the next three days or so participating in the meetings at the U.N. General Assembly.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s one piece of news that I want to get out of the way and then we\'ll open it up to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I\'m joined here by the Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes.\xc2\xa0 He can talk to you about some of the activities from overnight that all of you and your organizations have already reported on. The one piece of news is that this afternoon in New York, the President will drop by a meeting that\'s been convened by the Secretary of State that will include representatives of the nations who partnered with the United States in the operation in Syria last night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So you all saw, there were five partners from Arab nations who participated in the operation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re represented at the UN and they will be participating in this meeting the President will drop by.\xc2\xa0 There will be an opportunity for you all to see the President\xe2\x80\x99s interaction this afternoon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time is that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s late this afternoon at the Waldorf.\xc2\xa0 I think the timing is around 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to take questions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate that he\'ll take questions in that context.</p>\n<p>So with that piece of news out of the way, we\'ll open it up to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the imminent threat that prompted the bombings?\xc2\xa0 Was it Khorasan?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So the Khorasan Group is a group of extremists that is comprised of a number of individuals who we\'ve been tracking for a long time.\xc2\xa0 It includes some former al Qaeda operatives, core al Qaeda operatives from Afghanistan and Pakistan who made their way to Syria, remain in our view affiliated with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And we have been monitoring over the course of many months the development of plotting against the United States or Western targets emanating from Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So for some time now we\'ve been tracking plots to conduct attacks in the United States or Europe.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that attack plotting was imminent and that they had plans to conduct attacks external to Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we also believe, of course, that the Syrian regime was not able to take action against that threat.\xc2\xa0 So, in addition to the strikes against ISIL, we took action against the Khorasan Group to disrupt that plotting against the United States and Western targets.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How imminent, and where were they going to strike?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the specific details of plotting other than to say that we saw that they had very clear and concrete ambitions to launch external operations against the United States or Europe.\xc2\xa0 And so this was actual plotting that was ongoing from Syria, and the strike that we took last night was aimed to disrupt that plotting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this morning was the first time that we heard the President discuss this group or this threat and it was not part of the pitch he made to the American public asking for their support in these strikes in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this mark a significant expansion of the military campaign that we\'re carrying out there?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think when the President gave his speech to the nation about his strategy against the threat from ISIL, he made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99d be taking strikes in both Iraq and Syria --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ISIL, but not against --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, okay, so we see this very much as an extension of the threat posed by al Qaeda and their associated forces.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who have their origin, their history serving in al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re known to people who\xe2\x80\x99ve been following this threat for years.\xc2\xa0 They were in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 So this, frankly, is a part of the ongoing effort against al Qaeda in which you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us take strikes in Yemen; you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us take strikes in Somalia.\xc2\xa0 When there\xe2\x80\x99s an al Qaeda target we\'re going to take action against it.</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s unique about Syria is that the Assad regime was certainly unable to take action against this organization, the Khorasan Group, so therefore we felt the need to take action in our own defense.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just add that this is entirely consistent with the principle that the President did lay out in the address that Ben obviously worked on a lot, a core principle of this President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy that we\'re going to actively deny a safe haven to individuals or organizations that seek to establish a safe haven and use that safe haven to plot attacks against the U.S. homeland.\xc2\xa0 So these strikes last night are entirely consistent with that core principle of this presidency.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And, similarly, consistent with the 2001 AUMF, which is the basis under which we take action against al Qaeda and associated forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about coordination or notification there was to the Syrian government regarding what the U.S. and the other countries did last night?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because Jen has made it clear from State that there was sort of a vague, open-ended notice.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President obviously declared publicly our intention to take military action in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Subsequent to that, there was a direct contact to the Syrian regime to notify them of the fact that we would take direct action.\xc2\xa0 That was undertaken at the United Nations by Samantha Power to the Syrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I want to be very clear, though, that we did not coordinate with them, we did not provide them advance notice of the timing or of targets that the U.S. was going to strike.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we warned them to not pose a threat to our aircraft.\xc2\xa0 And again, going forward, there is no plan to have any coordination whatsoever with the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 Again, this was simply consistent with what the President had said -- a notification that we would be taking this action; frankly, a warning to not pose a risk to our aircraft.\xc2\xa0 And it was in no way an effort to coordinate or provide specific information about the types of targets or timing of targets that we would hit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the Syrians give you a green light to do it?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the Syrian response in a private diplomatic communication.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have significant differences with the Syrian regime.\xc2\xa0 We had been able to communicate with them on issues over the course of the last several years, for instance, when we needed to send a message about our concerns about chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously rare that we have that contact.\xc2\xa0 This was simply a matter of notifying them that we\xe2\x80\x99d be taking this action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did that take place?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to provide a specific time.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, it took place in recent days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering about the Arab partners that participated last night, which you all announced the President is going to stop by a meeting.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be the partnership we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see continuously through Syria?\xc2\xa0 Could that change?\xc2\xa0 Could you add partners?\xc2\xa0 Will that be sort of decided on per mission, or per week or per day?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think you will continue to see this coalition work together in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And again, we were joined by five Arab partners who flew with us last night.\xc2\xa0 A number of those countries took strikes with us last night.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon can give you the specifics of those roles.</p>\n<p>I think going forward, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to build this coalition.\xc2\xa0 So insofar as it will change, we will grow a coalition of nations to take different actions.\xc2\xa0 Some nations will take strikes in Syria; some nations will take strikes in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Some nations will participate in training and equipping of Iraqis, training and equipping of Syrians.\xc2\xa0 Some nations will help us in counter financing, stopping the flow of foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, this is the beginning, but part of what the President is going to be doing at the United Nations is consulting with allies and partners about additional contributions that can be made in both Iraq and Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the significance of the timing of the strikes -- last night, right before he goes to the UN?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We did not time this related to the UN meetings.\xc2\xa0 This was based on the development of the strike campaign plan by the Pentagon and by the coalition that we built.\xc2\xa0 So we wanted to make sure that we had good targets.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to make sure that we had a coalition in place so that we were acting together with partners, particularly Arab partners.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very significant that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s very unique that you have five Arab countries flying with us, taking direct military action in the Middle East on behalf of our common security.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful message.</p>\n<p>And the other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d just say for timing purposes, the President was briefed on the plan that had been developed when he was at CENTCOM by General Austin and other military leadership.\xc2\xa0 And the following day is when he gave the authorization to move forward with those strikes.\xc2\xa0 And at that point, it shifted to the discretion of the commander, General Austin, as well as the coalition-building exercise which was still coming together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given all the stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s gone on in the last 12 hours or so, can you talk a little bit about his speech to the General Assembly tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important moment for the President to put everything that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in the context of U.S. leadership in the world.\xc2\xa0 We are leading a coalition of countries against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We are leading an effort to combat the outbreak of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 We are leading an effort to impose costs on Russia and to support the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are many different issues at play in the world today.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the constant thread between them is U.S. leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President call upon the world to join us in confronting this threat from ISIL, but also to offer his vision of how U.S. leadership is going to deal with this set of challenges at a moment in the international community when, frankly, nations need to be stepping up to the plate and coming together to deal with threats as diverse as ISIL or the outbreak of Ebola or the type of aggression we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to still be trying to get the support of countries who may have either a philosophical objection to what the coalition did last night, or maybe just an opposition to using military force to confront these threats?\xc2\xa0 Are you still going to be trying to get them on board, for example, with interdicting foreign fighters, or the financial or the oil-related issues that work into this situation?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 And we absolutely are going to do that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, already we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen different nations have a different degree of willingness to conduct military action, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a significant role for them to play. \xc2\xa0For instance, you have a number of European countries like Germany, for instance, that haven\'t participated in airstrikes but they are providing arms and equipment for Kurdish forces.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s critically important.\xc2\xa0 For this to succeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just going to be about airstrikes, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be about the effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces, Kurdish forces, and Syrian opposition forces.</p>\n<p>And then, absolutely, we are going to need the cooperation of many countries to cut off ISIL financing and to stop the flow of foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 The President will lead a UN Security Council meeting that is focused specifically on this question of foreign fighters, and that requires cooperation across many countries so that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to have common protocols about how we can track those people who are traveling into and out of this region.\xc2\xa0 And then we have the ability to interdict foreign fighters before they can pose a threat either by reaching the battlefield in Syria and Iraq, or dangerously coming out of that theater to pose a risk in Europe and the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there will be many different roles for nations to play in this coalition.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, you can\xe2\x80\x99t overstate the importance of some of the non-military roles, given the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to defeat an organization like ISIL unless you\xe2\x80\x99re able to cut off its financing and stop this flow of foreign fighters that they\xe2\x80\x99ve benefited from.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you able to sense if the Khorasan strikes actually have disrupted the plot?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still reviewing the outcome of the strikes.\xc2\xa0 I think certainly the report from the Pentagon was that they successfully hit the targets that they were aiming at.\xc2\xa0 As to what impact that had on Khorasan leadership and operatives, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to run down in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were any American forces on the ground helping guide these attacks?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 There were no American forces on the ground associated with these attacks in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Again, these were taken from the air, from military assets in the region, but not involving any U.S. ground forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But based on a target list that you formed over the past month since this all started?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yeah, I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused increasingly on the threat from ISIL, we have looked at contingency plans for targets in both Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that accelerated when the President made the decision to take action in Syria, and gave guidance to his military commanders to develop essentially a campaign plan for Syria.\xc2\xa0 And after that work was done and he was briefed on it at CENTCOM by General Austin, the following day is when he gave his authorization to move forward when the timing was ready and the coalition was ready.</p>\n<p>And I should say, part of what is remarkable about our military is CENTCOM\xe2\x80\x99s ability to absorb the contributions of different partner nations very quickly so that we can essentially apportion roles for nations to play, so you can end up with five countries coming together on a fairly quick basis only in a matter of a short number of weeks from the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 To have those nations flying with us in the air, conducting airstrikes is a testament both I think to the support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s objective of defeating ISIL, Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s hard work in the region, and CENTCOM\xe2\x80\x99s ability to put together a coalition like this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have these five Arab nations agreed to participate or support airstrikes on an ongoing basis?\xc2\xa0 Or was this kind of the big action already?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, we expect that this will be done on an ongoing basis.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to in any way have solved this challenge in one night of airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 This is clearly going to have to be a sustained campaign.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a strong coalition with us going forward.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s so critically important to the region to see that there are a broad number of Arab partners who are with us.\xc2\xa0 This is not about the United States and ISIL; this is about the threat that ISIL poses not just to the United States, but to the people of the Arab world who are in closest proximity, to the Muslims who have been killed in far greater numbers than anybody else over the last several months. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, to have on the first night of these strikes in Syria Arab partners with us, that was an absolute priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And he wanted -- if at all possible -- to get that done.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, in getting five nations with us, I think we achieved that as well as we possibly could have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which Arab partners did what last night?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the Pentagon can give you a more specific breakdown.\xc2\xa0 They\'re doing an operations briefing now.\xc2\xa0 All five countries flew with us.\xc2\xa0 A number of countries conducted airstrikes with us, and the Pentagon can speak to the particulars better than I can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does he want to tell the Prime Minister of Iraq when he meets with him?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we very much supported Prime Minister Abadi, who has put forward a far more inclusive program in Iraq than the previous government.\xc2\xa0 I think he wants to underscore our support for his leadership, his efforts to bring about an inclusive government.\xc2\xa0 I think he wants to discuss the nature of our ongoing commitment, not just through airstrikes, but through training and equipping of Iraqi security forces; and discuss the political program within Iraq that addresses the legitimate aspirations of all of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s different communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we believe Prime Minister Abadi is off to a very strong start, and we want to discuss how to cooperate going forward, and also, frankly, how to cooperate with this coalition of countries that want to contribute to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future as well.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, everybody.\xc2\xa0 See you on the ground.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:13 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
