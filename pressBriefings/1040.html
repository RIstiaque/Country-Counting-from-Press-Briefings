EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everybody ready?\xc2\xa0 Let me just start by saying thank you all for being here and for coming with us on this trip.\xc2\xa0 Second, I just wanted to remind folks that as part of our larger efforts to strengthen our nation\xe2\x80\x99s preparedness and resiliency, the FCC and FEMA will conduct the first nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System this coming Wednesday, that\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern.\xc2\xa0 The test will last about 30 seconds.\xc2\xa0 The National Emergency Alert System is an alert and warning system that can be activated by the President if needed to provide information to the American public during emergencies.\xc2\xa0 The system is already tested and used frequently on the local level but has never before been tested on a nationwide basis.\xc2\xa0 For more details I refer you to the FCC and FEMA.\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to make sure everybody knows that it\xe2\x80\x99s just a test.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what can you tell us about the changes in the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s duties?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One, I think a little bit more is being made of this than in fact is happening.\xc2\xa0 The Chief of Staff Bill Daley has asked, as part of his efforts to make the White House run as efficiently as possible, has asked Pete Rouse, counselor to the President, to help streamline and make more efficient and effective internal communications in the White House and to help with some of the day-to-day management of the place.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill Daley, as the Chief of Staff, retains obviously all of his authority and ultimate responsibility for the White House operations and White House staff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you enumerate exactly what duties have transferred to Mr. Rouse?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s less about transferring duties than it is about adding responsibilities without subtracting any from anybody else.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about making the White House as effective and efficient as possible.\xc2\xa0 And this is actually a process that\xe2\x80\x99s been in the works now for a number of weeks, even possibly a couple of months.\xc2\xa0 And what Bill announced in one of our meetings yesterday morning was simply that, as most of you know or a lot of you know, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked Pete to take on these additional responsibilities to help us function better.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly about internal communication, making sure that everybody has the information they need so we can serve the President as effectively as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was the President involved in making this decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s Bill Daley\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 But obviously --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President consulted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that the Chief of Staff discussed this with the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s a report out of Paris that Sarkozy told the President that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Do you think this kind of bad relations may have any impact on the peace process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on the reported conversation that took place apparently in a bilateral.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on the conversation specifically.\xc2\xa0 I mean, stepping back, I will say that it\xe2\x80\x99s well known that the President and that the U.S. and France did not agree on the UNESCO vote regarding the Palestinians and that we -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, very firm position, has been that efforts to achieve U.N. membership or membership in U.N. agencies by the Palestinians were premature and counterproductive to the ultimate goal here, which is a negotiated peace between the two parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think, though, this reflects a growing frustration with world leaders with Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on the specific conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re fed up with him; I have to deal with him every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So clearly there\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President said, there\xe2\x80\x99s dislike there.\xc2\xa0 What are we supposed to take away from that message?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on the specific conversation.\xc2\xa0 What I can say more broadly is that this President\xe2\x80\x99s position has been quite clear on the issue of efforts by the Palestinians to achieve through the United Nations what can only be achieved effectively through direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes very firmly that both sides, the Israelis and the Palestinians, need to take those steps that bring them closer together to direct negotiations and not ones that make it harder to have that happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, have you seen the IAEA report on Iran, and do you have any response to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s been released, has it?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can comment on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you if there\xe2\x80\x99s any sign or evidence that Tehran has made a political decision to pursue making a nuclear weapon, or whether the view is that that decision has not yet been made?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we let the report come out before we make assessments about what it means.\xc2\xa0 What I said yesterday is that we certainly expect it to reflect the concern that this government and the United States, this President have about Iranian behavior, and to reinforce the need for the international community to act collectively to put pressure and isolate Iran as long as it refuses to honor its international commitments with regards to its nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about Syria.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. in Geneva said today I think 3,500 Syrians have been killed in the crackdown there.\xc2\xa0 Just wondering, is there a sense from the White House that there needs to be a different approach from the United States or the West in dealing with Syria in response to that ongoing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, our position is well known.\xc2\xa0 We believe that President Assad has lost his legitimacy to rule and that he should step down, and certainly that the regime should cease its violent actions against its own citizens, which are unacceptable and reprehensible.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with our international partners and allies through a variety of means to make that message clear to the Syrians and to put pressure on the Syrian regime, the Assad regime, to change its behavior and to allow the Syrian people to determine their own future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has anyone -- has the President or anyone at NSC reached out to Israel, to Netanyahu in particular, on Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific communications to report, or that even that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, our administration, the State Department, the NSC and others are obviously in regular contact with all of our allies and partners about this issue, but nothing specific to report.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Dan Shapiro there now, do you know?\xc2\xa0 Is Ambassador Shapiro --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the veterans benefits bill, Republican leaders seem to be indicating that it has a good chance of being the first component of the President\xe2\x80\x99s American Jobs Act that may get passed by both houses.\xc2\xa0 And they say a large reason for that is because the millionaire surtax was dropped.\xc2\xa0 Given that, and in the interest of passing other components of the President\xe2\x80\x99s jobs act, is the administration -- does it feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to drop the surtax altogether?\xc2\xa0 Or what\xe2\x80\x99s the position there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we look forward to passage of this very important provision of the American Jobs Act, hope it does pass, and the President will sign it into law.\xc2\xa0 The issue is if the Republicans want to put forward proposals, as they have, that are paid for by adding burdens to the middle class or by taking measures that would actually contract growth, would have a negative impact on economic growth, no, the President won\xe2\x80\x99t support that.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the proposals that he put forward and that the Senate Democrats put forward to pay for the American Jobs Act are entirely reasonable.\xc2\xa0 They also happen to be viewed as entirely reasonable by a significant majority of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Republicans will have to explain if they continue to insist on protecting millionaires and billionaires at the expense of the up to 2 million people who could have jobs next year if the American Jobs Act were to pass and be paid for, why they make that choice.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a wise choice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s a poll out this morning that\xe2\x80\x99s saying that opponents of the President in Congress are simply just trying to sabotage the American Jobs Act in hopes that he won\xe2\x80\x99t get reelected, and that the majority of the country out there right now, or half of the country, believes that there are those in Congress who are trying to sabotage the President.\xc2\xa0 Any comment on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly think that what is the case is that unfortunately Republicans in Congress are not taking the kinds of actions that they could take to help the economy grow and create jobs in the near term.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is the fundamental problem with the proposals that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward and called and labeled jobs proposals, because independent economists have looked at them and judged some of them to be fine policy, but none of them to be the kinds of policies that would grow the economy or create jobs in the near term.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s simply a matter of economic analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the American public, which has pretty overwhelmingly made clear in surveys that it believes that the number-one issue right now is economy and jobs, wonders why Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share its priorities, so -- their priorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs to motivation, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously for the American people and constituents of the various elected members of Congress to decide.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the Head Start program?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is now the time to make cuts like this, as it\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- the President is always talking about education and it seems like a strange time to make it harder for the most disadvantaged children to get --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, in fact, this is about improving the program by reforming it by insisting that the lowest-performing ones compete for federal funds.\xc2\xa0 So this is about a reform measure that will improve Head Start around the country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re visiting a Head Start program today that is exemplary and excellent, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of standard that the President believes programs around the country should meet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But won\xe2\x80\x99t some lose funding, then, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the criteria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, for the specifics of it I refer you to the policy experts.\xc2\xa0 But I believe the purpose here is to lift the quality of Head Start programs to insist that in exchange for federal funding that high performance standards be met.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if a third of these programs have to reapply, re-compete for funding, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that a lot of children could lose access to these Head Start programs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to expanding access to Head Start, commitment to early education programs, I think is well known and he has fought for them despite resistance in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So, again, efforts to improve a program, to reform it, to make it better, I think are to the ultimate benefit of American children across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:44 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
