Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  1:04 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ready to go?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 President Lee talked about new measures and policies that he and President Obama had agreed to talk to the other members of the five-party talks -- about new measures and policies on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on what he meant by that and what they agreed on?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything additional on that, in terms of the statement that went out and what the two Presidents discussed.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have a longstanding commitment in the defense of the Republic of Korea, and I think, obviously, the steps -- the important steps that the Security Council took over the past several days -- we had Ambassador Rice in here to discuss that last week -- demonstrates the seriousness with which the international community is addressing what is happening with North Korea.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said -- Susan Rice also said last week when she was talking about this new resolution that the United States has other measures that it\'s considering taking, not waiting to take but considering taking now.\xc2\xa0 And so if you\'re not willing to talk about what those might be or what\'s on the table, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this sort of an empty threat to North Korea?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because we don\'t discuss things publicly.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about on Iran, is the President prepared at some point to more forcefully denounce what\'s happening there against the protestors?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been quite forceful on two occasions in the past 24 hours, in discussing the universal right that people have to peaceably demonstrate.\xc2\xa0 He\'s deplored the violence -- deplored and condemned the violence that we\'ve seen, and underscored that the world is seeing in Iran a yearning for change.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has also, rightly, underscored that this is a vigorous debate inside of Iran by Iranians about who is going to -- about the leadership in their country.\xc2\xa0 And as he said this afternoon, it\'s not a good idea to meddle in that sovereignty.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to follow up on the President\'s remarks about the financial regulatory reform that\'s going to come out.\xc2\xa0 He said that you would not, in fact, see a host of new regulatory agencies added.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean there will not be any new regulatory agencies added?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he said "a host of."\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There could be maybe one -- some lawmakers think -- would like to see a new agency to look out on behalf of consumers.\xc2\xa0 Could that be part of the plan?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will, as the President said -- I\'d be hard pressed to get ahead of the President saying he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get ahead of himself.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, show a little ankle.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe if I can get work -- get a job with CBS.\xc2\xa0 But, no, I think the President underscored again today the strong need for regulatory reform.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve all witnessed over the past many months what happens in an environment that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the regulations and the watchdogs that are needed to ensure that we don\'t ever again get to the precipice of where we were just a few months ago and what caused that.<br/> <br/>  Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry -<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I just -- kind of a different side of the same question.\xc2\xa0 When he talked about consolidating, does that mean that some agencies may be closed or merged into other agencies?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Trust me, you\'ll have plenty of opportunity to do all this tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President went a little farther today than he did yesterday, saying he had concerns about the election, when directly talking about the election results, the legitimacy of the election.\xc2\xa0 What are his concerns, and what are they based on?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve enumerated some of those concerns over the course of the past few days.\xc2\xa0 I think irregularities in general.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve seen -- I think I saw reports that one of the candidates overwhelmingly lost their home region.\xc2\xa0 But I think obviously the international community is watching with some concern.\xc2\xa0 Obviously even those in Iran have noted concern with the outcome, and that\'s why they\'re also looking into this.\xc2\xa0 But I think -- again, I think the international community has concern not just about what happened in the election but what has happened in the aftermath.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to Arab allies or other conduits, to Khamenei or any other of the power structure in Iran, to talk about what happens next?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I would stress for you the importance of what the President discussed, also in his comments both yesterday and today, about ensuring that while we abhor the violence associated with this vigorous Iranian debate, that we also respect their sovereignty.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 The AP was saying that the two American journalists who had been sentenced last week to 12 years of hard labor had admitted to illegally crossing into North Korea.\xc2\xa0 First, can you tell us if you know whether or not that\'s true?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, what is the administration doing to follow up on this?\xc2\xa0 Is there a special representative or an envoy who is responsible or working towards their release?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t have much to add to what we\'ve said in the past few days, that we think -- that the administration is working to ensure their safe release; that we strongly believe -- and I think the Presidents reiterated this today -- that these two journalists should be released on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to get into envoys and things like that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another matter, it was last week the President said that he wanted to make sure taxpayer dollars were spent well, the stimulus package, against potential boondoggles and wasteful spending.\xc2\xa0 Since then, Senator Coburn has come out with a report saying that he\'s taking a look at a hundred different programs, saying that he has found wasteful spending, including a turtle wildlife crossing that he says cost $3 million, and 8,000 Social Security checks that were sent to people who are deceased.</div> <div class="legacy-para">First, can you tell me whether or not this report is credible in your opinion?\xc2\xa0 And if so, has the administration addressed some of those concerns?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ve seen parts of this report and I\'ve seen parts of our response and I think there\'s a longer, more detailed response that we\'d be happy to provide you.\xc2\xa0 But a number of things look to be inaccurate in the "second opinion" itself.\xc2\xa0 There appear to be the assumption that projects are being funded using recovery money, which isn\'t true.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the very first project that\'s outlined is a decision that\'s ultimately made by the state, not by the feds, in terms of how particular revolving fund money is used.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are a number of entries throughout this report that are just simply wrong.\xc2\xa0 This President has taken historic steps to ensure that there is adequate transparency, and that this money is spent the way it\'s intended to be used.\xc2\xa0 There are projects within the report that haven\'t been funded; have been canceled based on our own looking into this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So again, I think the report appears to be, in many, many cases, just flat out wrong.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any examples that were correct that the administration is addressing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not looked through each and every one of them.\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look through each and every one of them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Dennis Ross moving into the White House with larger powers?\xc2\xa0 And also, is the President calling for nuclear disarmament of the whole region of Asia?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements about the State Department or the White House.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has enormous confidence, and has for quite some time, in Dennis Ross and what he brings to our foreign policy team.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has stated clearly in terms of -- and I think he reiterated in the first question he got today -- the priority of ensuring the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why can\'t you speak on Ross?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because there\'s no policy -- there\'s no personnel announcements to make.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he here?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where he is.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you, wherever he is, he\'s working for the administration on behalf of the administration.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the story wrong?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, what does that mean?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It means I don\'t have any policy or personnel announcements regarding Dennis Ross.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t necessarily mean the story is wrong.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\'re suggesting?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m suggesting that, if I had a personnel announcement to make regarding Dennis Ross, I\'d make it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not knocking down the story that appeared --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m telling you that the President has enormous confidence in him.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\'t have any personnel announcements to make --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you really tell us what you\'re trying to say?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no personnel announcements to make today, Helen.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\'t ask for a retraction -- I\'m not going to belabor the point.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No retraction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d be one busy -- I\'d be one busy man if that were the case.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you translate some of this diplo-speak?\xc2\xa0 Three times President Lee said -- talked about the firm relationship between South Korea and the United States when responding to a question about the North Korean threat.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- did he ask for an assurance from the President that if there\'s a military strike against South Korea that the U.S. will respond, that\'s unequivocal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, we\'ve had that type of relationship with the Republic of Korea for --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So nothing has changed on that front?\xc2\xa0 And that was reiterated today and that\'s the way we should read the words "firm," and all of that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously this is something that has -- that we\'ve responded to.\xc2\xa0 I think as we\'ve said many times before, the increasingly -- the reactions of the North Koreans in alienating themselves from their own responsibilities and from those responsibilities and isolating themselves from the rest of the world, that they\'re going alone down a different path.\xc2\xa0 The President believes there\'s a different way for North Korea.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think what he discussed today with President Lee was a continuation of the strong relationship that we have with the Republic of Korea and the strong international reactions and steps that have been taken to coordinate that response, and to take some extremely tough actions, all of what Ambassador Rice outlined just last week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I remember not long after the first launch in late March and early April, there was some vast skepticism that tough actions and steps could be agreed upon by a group of five nations, a group of 15 nations.\xc2\xa0 Not only were they agreed upon, but they\'re now being implemented.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is the President getting his information on Iran right now?\xc2\xa0 Is he just reacting to the news reports that everybody has seen, or do you guys feel like you have some intelligence on the ground that\'s telling you where things stand?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can assure you the President gets a regular intelligence briefing, but I\'ll demure the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he had any conversations with allies about a coordinated response?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like he\'s meddling in the Iranian elections, but at what point does the President\'s position that he is willing to speak with the Ahmadinejad government bolster the Ahmadinejad regime?\xc2\xa0 And is there a time when he would suspend that offer as the election results go through a contestation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a word?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m almost sure that it\'s not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But leaving that aside for one moment --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s a print guy that made up -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know, let me say, if that\'s -- I\'m going to do my crossword puzzle tonight; I don\'t know if that\'s -- look, I would say this, Jonathan.\xc2\xa0 The concerns that we have about Iran are no different than we had last Thursday or last Friday.\xc2\xa0 Our primary concerns are obviously the state sponsorship and the spread of terror, and their efforts to secure a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Those interests -- our interests are no different today than they were before the election.\xc2\xa0 The President remains committed to strong action and principled diplomacy to address our national interests; that our interest haven\'t changed regardless of ultimately who the Iranians pick.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the policy going to be on release of the names of White House visitors?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The policy -- as you know, I think many of you know, this has involved -- visitor logs have been involved in some litigation dating back to some time in 2006.\xc2\xa0 The White House is reviewing that policy based on some of that litigation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s just you\'re not going either way on it now, and you\'re not refusing to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re reviewing what has been the policy of -- the previous policy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is doing that review?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The White House Counsel\'s Office and other people in the administration.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the length of the review?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact timeline.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a mandate to be more transparent than the previous administration?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we ran on that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In this specific regard?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what\'s under review.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the goal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\'s the goal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that the goal, to be more transparent on these visitor logs than the previous administration?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The goal is -- and I think the President, who underscored his commitment to transparency on his first full day in office -- this is not a contest between this administration or that administration, or any administration; it\'s to uphold the principle of open government.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would the President have any objection to the public knowing who is coming in here to visit?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve taken actions to let people know who are.\xc2\xa0 I think again, Peter, this dates back to litigation long before we ever showed up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you might have to uphold precedent here, possibly?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of what\'s being reviewed by the Counsel\'s Office.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the administration provide emergency aid to California, or are you rejecting that to avoid similar requests from other states?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously many states throughout the country, because of the slowdown in our economy, find themselves with severe budgetary constraints.\xc2\xa0 The President believed and addressed part of this in the recovery and reinvestment plan by ensuring the largest amount of fiscal relief that we\'ve seen moved to states in the history of our country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">It\'s obviously not an easy time for the state of California. We\'ll continue to monitor the challenges that they have.\xc2\xa0 But this budgetary problem, unfortunately, is one that they\'re going to have to solve.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, is the administration comfortable with the kind of precedent California would have to impose, specifically on its participation in Medicaid and SCHIP, which the President has identified as significant priorities of his administration, and in one regard, SCHIP, an achievement of this administration?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if -- I don\'t know the degree to which we\'ve analyzed each of California\'s individual cuts. Obviously we\'ve had to make -- and states have had to make very difficult decisions as it relates to our budget.\xc2\xa0 And these aren\'t easy times for states.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Jonathan\'s question, just to have it on the record.\xc2\xa0 The President is still willing to talk to Ahmadinejad about U.S.-Iranian issues, even currently, is that correct?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is still willing to talk to Ahmadinejad about the various U.S. issues, and that\'s not been changed at all by the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- status of this election?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to direct engagement with the Iranian government on issues of our national interest, including their pursuit of a nuclear weapon and their sponsorship for terror.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the disputed election does not in any way change that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the disputed election is something for Iranians to work out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have an opinion as to whether or not foreign journalists should be allowed to cover that story and remain inside Iran?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President spoke both yesterday and today about what he thinks of his universal values, and obviously --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He spoke about people in the streets and Iranians --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think having a robust free press that covers an important story for the world is something that the President believes strongly in.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe the Internet and texting access should be restored?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up?\xc2\xa0 Sky News has designated a spot on their Web site, as other organizations have, for people who are tweeting, who are sending SMS\'s, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 In light of the fact that we don\'t have a diplomatic relationship, is the White House monitoring these various Web sites for that information?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with somebody at NSC, but I don\'t have anything specific.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said in Cairo that countries that elect their governments are better -- the governments are better, more stable, better able to provide economic opportunities.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States have a national interest in the will of the Iranian people being accurately reflected in this election?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that he\'s expressed concern, as the international community has.\xc2\xa0 Obviously any election, if it\'s going to -- any election should reflect the will of the people.\xc2\xa0 That, by definition, is an election.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I would also mention, Scott, that the President said that it\'s important -- elections are important, but also the decisions that governments make after elections are important.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why our interests as they relate to the Iranian government are unchanged.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are you at all concerned that the measured response of the United States so far to the Iranian elections could harm America or the President\'s image among democracy advocates not only in Iran but around the world?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think this administration\'s commitment to democracy has been demonstrated in the commitment in resources that we\'ve put forward.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, I think it\'s important that I reemphasize what the President said about sovereignty, but more importantly, that I emphasize that this is a debate inside of Iran for Iranians.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, health care.\xc2\xa0 CBO, as I think you know, has scored Ted Kennedy\'s bill as costing over a trillion dollars, and yet it still is only going to ensure about a third of the uninsured.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t that -- I realized you said that that\'s his bill and not your bill, but doesn\'t that bode ill for health care reform in general and the President\'s hope of ensuring everybody?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, to the extent that you spend that amount of money, which is in the ballpark of what the administration has said it\'s going to cost --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In reading stories on this, I think it\'s clear that this is an old proposal, an incomplete proposal.\xc2\xa0 I think what\'s important is what the President outlined yesterday, in his speech to the doctors, that we know clearly what the cost of inaction is.\xc2\xa0 We know what that cost is to the federal budget; we know what it is to state budgets; we know what it is to budgets of families and to businesses, large and small.\xc2\xa0 And that inaction is something we simply can\'t afford.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President I think has laid out strong principles that he believes should be contained in legislation so that we can see significant cost-saving for families and small businesses that are struggling.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think this has many twists and turns to go.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one incomplete, older proposal I don\'t think is indicative of where we are now.\xc2\xa0 And I would also mention this -- I think the President has outlined close to $950 billion in savings that he believes could be used to ensure that a plan for health care reform is deficit-neutral.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re confident that the President\'s proposal or what he wants to sign is going to be so dramatically different from what CBO looked at, that you will ensure the bulk of the unemployed --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the committee that\'s worked on that bill will tell you the bill they have now is.\xc2\xa0 Look, as I\'ve said, Mark, the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t looking to pass -- for Congress to pass and for him to sign something that doesn\'t significantly cut the amount of cost that families and small businesses are struggling with.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated yesterday that we shouldn\'t be a nation that sees tens of millions of uninsured.\xc2\xa0 And he has some very firm principles in mind that have to be met as part of health care reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Ann.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does that principle work, though?\xc2\xa0 If he promises repeatedly that Americans can keep the doctors and the health insurance they like, if they like it, but if he succeeds in getting a kind of a government plan, small businesses desert their private insurers and go to a government plan, how can people keep the doctors and plans they want if their employers opt out for --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I guess I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily subscribe to this notion that presenting a public option with better choice and more competition will result dramatically in employers dropping what they already have.\xc2\xa0 The notion of injecting a public option, we believe, will do exactly what I said in terms of choice and competition.\xc2\xa0 Having somebody ensure that there is an affordable placeholder in the market I think will have a dramatic effect in terms of driving down costs, exactly what the President talks about each and every time he talks about health care reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the time Air Force One arrived back here yesterday, the complaints on Capitol Hill were that the government option would drive private insurance out of business.\xc2\xa0 How can he make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President outlined pretty clearly yesterday, the principle to ensure that if you like what you have, you can keep it; that the injection of an option that ensures greater choice among those that don\'t have access and competition that drives down costs is an important option that has to be preserved in this entire debate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can you promise that?\xc2\xa0 How can you promise -- if employers are in charge of providing insurance for their employees, how can the President say --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because the injection of competition will drive down costs.\xc2\xa0 People -- other insurance companies will follow that.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t set a market -- if a marketplace is set that is so vastly out of whack, people have to make decisions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the report said that there would be some millions knocked off of their private plans as a public option.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, based on what I think we all acknowledge is an older proposal and not one that\'s fully laid out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys think you can offer a plan that\'s less expensive and people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to flock to it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what happens in a marketplace like that, if I understand the free enterprise system, is that increased choice in competition drives down the prices for other insurance. That\'s why a strong public option is necessary to ensure that competition.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a free enterprise system, if the competitor -- one has an inexhaustible source of tax revenue as a public option funded by the government might, then the private sector can\'t --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s the 11th question up there.\xc2\xa0 Could we get some back here?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just by Major, or by the first two rows?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By Major -- 11, 11.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve counted.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have a new record.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask just one?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me work my way back, Lester, so that I ensure that the 11 questions that Major has had during our short period of time together -- let me give a chance for somebody in the third and fourth row to break that record.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Peter.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Back to the turtles for a moment.\xc2\xa0 How do you ensure the priorities in the stimulus package are met? In Florida, 200 faculty and staff are going to be laid off at a time when the state transportation department is going to spend $3 million paving a pathway for turtles so that they can safely cross a highway.\xc2\xa0 Is that a priority --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not looked through the entire report.\xc2\xa0 I think that, again, I\'d point out the number of inaccuracies and simply -- the entries in the report that are simply wrong.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I just have a rebuttal on that one, and I guess the broader question is, is it possible with a stimulus package of this size to prioritize in a way to ensure that the money goes to the worthiest projects?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly the system that the President has set up.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the priority of any recovery plan. And I think that a reasonable look at the spending thus far denotes that that\'s happened in this case, that the priorities are being met, that funding is going to where it\'s needed.<br/> <br/>  But, look, you\'re using an example of state budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier in relation to California, there are very few entities -- business, states, the federal government -- that are immune to the type of dramatic downturn that we\'ve seen in the economy.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why the President endeavored to seek a recovery and reinvestment plan that would actually make a difference.<br/> <br/>  April.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the U.S. Conference of Mayors was very happy early on in this administration, saying they had a friend in the White House when the President was engaging them on the recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 Now they\'re very, very upset about the White House not crossing this picketing.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about that?\xc2\xa0 Is the good of the whole being neglected for one city?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the administration has denoted pretty clearly that obviously we have worked with officials at a city, county, state level, particularly as it relates to the recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 But I think, as the statement from me says clearly, it\'s not our policy to cross the picket line.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- okay.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m going to go hypothetically, but I want an answer, a real answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t "contestation" then.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a real word?\xc2\xa0 But here\'s the deal.\xc2\xa0 If the conference, the three-day conference, was in another city, would the high-profile White House officials have attended?\xc2\xa0 If it were in another city that did not have any kind of picket --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, let me see if I\'m accurately paraphrasing your question.\xc2\xa0 If there wasn a picket line that we wouldn\'t cross, would we go?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 In another city.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, our policy is we don\'t want to cross a picket line.\xc2\xa0 So if there\'s not a picket line in Smithville and that\'s where the conference is, we\'ll go to the conference.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, another conference in July, the NAACP.\xc2\xa0 We understand it looks very favorable that the President could be speaking to the nation\'s oldest civil rights organization?\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 And tell us why.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has spoken on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the final thing.\xc2\xa0 I assume, strongly, that he\'ll go, and looks forward to honoring their historic commitment.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is his message?\xc2\xa0 He\'s gone to Muslim America, he\'s gone to Hispanic America.\xc2\xa0 What is his message to black America as the first African American President?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me not get ahead of a speech that probably hasn\'t been written.<br/> <br/>  David.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Thirteen questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\'ll settle for two.\xc2\xa0 On the visitor log issue, while the policy is under review you\'ve denied two requests from MSNBC and from crew, and then was quoted up by MSNBC, saying that, in essence, there should be the right to hold secret meetings in the White House, and he gave a forward examples when that might be needed.\xc2\xa0 Is it the position of the White House that you need to hold secret meetings on occasion here, and thus --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are obviously occasions in which the President is going to meet privately with advisors on topics that are of great national importance, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so then how does that square with a policy that might end up -- a policy review that might end up releasing some visitor logs?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me not conclude the review that\'s underway.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, just --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t you give us a length of that review?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have it.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you find it?\xc2\xa0 Can you find out?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will see if they have one, yes.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CNN is reporting that --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is two --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is two.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one -- just one.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just one big microphone, or just one big question?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both.\xc2\xa0 Both.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CNN is reporting that State Department officials are working with Twitter and other social networks to keep communications open with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House is involved with, too?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think, as I said earlier, ensuring an active free press on the ground, as well as communications either through texting or Twitter are incredibly important.\xc2\xa0 I think, David, you are seeing the yearning for change that the President talked about, and the President has talked about, right now.\xc2\xa0 I think the peaceable demonstration and that yearning especially by youth in Iran is heartening for the world to see and is important for the world to see.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that U.S. interest with Iran haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed since last Thursday or Friday.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the talks the U.S. -- (inaudible) -- in addressing those interests has gone much harder because of the events of the last week?\xc2\xa0 And is it going to be much more difficult to build domestic political support for an engagement strategy with Ahmadinejad as President after a disputed election?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ve seen quite a few people in the last 24 hours discuss a more vigorous policy in engaging Iran, quite frankly, than I\'ve seen in any number of months.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I\'ll go back to what I said just a moment ago.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re seeing the yearning for change.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re witnessing something that we believe -- the world is witnessing something that\'s tremendously important<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the war funding, the Republicans have announced they\'re going to vote en bloc against the war-funding measure.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that Republicans or Democrats who vote against the war-funding measure are putting our troops in danger?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would note with some irony the new message position of Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 As I said last week, I think there are many important reasons to support this supplemental funding:\xc2\xa0 ensuring our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq; the commitments that we\'ve made to Pakistan to help; and as I said last week, the extremely important efforts -- as the World Health Organization denotes we have reached internationally a pandemic stage, the important money that\'s there for the preparation and response to what we and others throughout the world assume will be another visit from H1N1 this fall.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  I think for any number of reasons, the administration strongly believes that a vote in support of all of these measures is truly important.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And their reasoning they say is because of the IMF funding.\xc2\xa0 In 1998, John Boehner said:\xc2\xa0 "Given the crises we have around the world, the U.S. needs to provide leadership.\xc2\xa0 The only real avenue is the IMF."\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Interesting change of position.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten his response on that?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to hear yours.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President made a commitment at the G20 to ensure that as we watched an economic downturn, we watched an even steeper downturn in exports, which hurts not only -- it hurts all countries, but it hurts particularly developing nations.\xc2\xa0 This is important relief to ensure that we have strong global trade.\xc2\xa0<br/> <br/>  I don\'t think, given where we are in the world economy, that we would want to see a pullback in that commitment.\xc2\xa0 And I think we should understand that exports create jobs right here at home.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on immigration, what\'s the reason that the meeting has been delayed week after week?\xc2\xa0 Some Hispanic organizations are saying that\'s because the President is losing ground in the support in the House and in the Senate on\xc2\xa0 immigration reform discussion.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the schedule here is, as always, a work in progress.\xc2\xa0 And for those reasons, the meeting has been I think rescheduled to the -- I think it\'s the 25th, if I have it off the top of my head.\xc2\xa0 But the President remains committed to working with Congress to seek changes in our immigration law.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\'t -- but that\'s not shifted because a meeting got pushed back on the schedule.<br/> <br/>  Tim.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House majority leader said he has reason to believe that the President is considering an executive order that would prevent the release of the detainee abuse photos.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President is considering?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tim, all I\'m going to say on this is that the President has committed to all interested parties that he intends to do what\'s necessary to keep those photos from being released, and that he intends to keep that commitment.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he give Hoyer a reason to believe that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t get into any private conversations.<br/> <br/>  Lester, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Historian Victor Davis Hanson cites what he terms, "The President\'s politically correct canard that the Renaissance was fueled by Arab learning, and the President\'s statement that abolition of slavery and civil rights in the U.S. were accomplished without violence," as two of seven presidential errors.\xc2\xa0 And my question:\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe Dr. Hanson is wrong, or do you believe your speechwriters and the President made some mistakes?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I have to hand it to you that you have in only one question covered some five or six centuries of world history.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, just mistakes -- White House mistakes.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Should I ask you a question and you respond, or should I give a --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d be delighted --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At least you\'re not leaning into where you think the answer to such a historically significant and important question -- I\'m not familiar with the work of the esteemed historian.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen it.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that not knowing who this historian is, I\'ll put my money on our speechwriters.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for getting back to us.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  1:46 P.M.
