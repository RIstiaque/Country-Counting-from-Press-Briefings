Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:13 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 You just got the readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Amir of Qatar.\xc2\xa0 They had an opportunity to speak for themselves to readout that meeting.</p>\n<p>Other than noting that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything at the top here so we can go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the Keystone bill is arriving at the White House today, or already has.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I hear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us when the President intends to veto it, as he promised?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned yesterday, the President does intend to veto this piece of legislation and we intend to do it without any drama or fanfare or delay.\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an update on this later on today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you expect it today?\xc2\xa0 We can expect it today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, you can count on that today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage or paper statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a statement through the usual channels.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No photo spray or anything?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the pipeline.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want that news to leak out some other way.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You physically have the bill now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that Congress did send the text of the bill to the White House this morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On DHS funding, as you know, the Senate Majority Leader has offered to split the bill so that there\xe2\x80\x99s a separate vote on the immigration policies of the President and another one on the funding itself.\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid has objected to the sequencing of that.\xc2\xa0 He wants to vote on the clean funding bill first before you go on to immigration.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a preference on that?\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to at least just get this issue off the table and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter on sequencing?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The official White House position is that the President served in the United States Senate for a period between 2004 and 2008, in which he readily weighed in on legislative maneuvers and strategies related to the complicated procedures that essentially guide the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 At this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of Congress to figure out how to perform among their most basic functions, which is to ensure that the budget for the Department of Homeland Security gets passed in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Josh, this is his party and it could essentially end up closing one of his executive agencies.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has -- well, Republicans spent a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of effort going around the country about making the case why they should be put in charge of the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 They succeeded in that effort, and they persuaded the American people to hand them the responsibility of the majority of both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the question now facing Republicans is how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to use that authority and whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it responsibly, in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the country and whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fact of the matter is I can\xe2\x80\x99t find anybody who thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to shut down the Department of Homeland Security, which means that congressional Republicans should simply do their job.\xc2\xa0 And they should pass legislation that would fully fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of this year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Senator McConnell is offering a clean bill like you demanded, so why not get behind this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the particulars in terms of exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward, but ultimately it will be up to the individual members of Congress to make their own decision.\xc2\xa0 But, again, congressional Republicans are in charge.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re in the majority.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that they sought, and these are exactly the kinds of problems that they hoped to have the opportunity to solve, and we look forward to them doing it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next question on Iran.\xc2\xa0 The contours of the deal that are being discussed would allow Iran to potentially consider moving toward a nuclear device after 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s a period of time -- I know that parts of the discussion have been about a 20-year period before -- that seems to be the compromise number.\xc2\xa0 Is that a number that we can trust the Iranians to stick by and not to begin producing a nuclear device after that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\'m loathe to get into the negotiating details of the position that is adopted by the United States and our international partners when they are sitting across the table from the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 However, I will say that there was a report today indicating that we were negotiating for essentially a 10-year deal.\xc2\xa0 Those reports are not correct.\xc2\xa0 That does not reflect the accurate negotiating position of the United States and our international partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the second part of your question is important as well.\xc2\xa0 It goes to whether or not the United States and the international community is prepared to start trusting the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 I think the point, Jim, of these negotiations is to not just reach an agreement with the Iranians, but reach an agreement with the Iranians that we can verify on a continuing, ongoing basis; that there is ample reason for the international community to not put a lot of faith in the claims of the Iranians when it comes to their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 It was just a few years ago that there was this covert nuclear facility in Iran that had previously been undeclared that did yield some evidence indicating that Iran was trying to secretly develop a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what we need is a clear agreement from the international community and the Iranians and an agreement that is verifiable.\xc2\xa0 And any part of an agreement will include ready access by the international community to ensure that Iran is living up to their end of the bargain.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re saying that reports that the deal would clamp down on Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities for at least 10 years and then slowly ease those restrictions, that isn\'t correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not willing to get into the specific details of our negotiating position.\xc2\xa0 But there are some who are making the case publicly that we are in favor of a deal that would just be 10 years in duration, and that is not accurate.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Keystone, the veto is one thing, but I\'m wondering, how long is it going to take the administration to finish its review of whether the project is in the national interest?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen today as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a review that is being conducted by the State Department, and so you can contact the State Department for an update on the timing of that review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President isn\'t going to announce something on that as well today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, the review is being conducted by the State Department, so you can get an update from them about their timing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, there are reports that the DOJ is not going to press charges against George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t confirm that.\xc2\xa0 So you should check with the Department of Justice about any announcement they may or may not be planning to make at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Lastly, on Ukraine, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would deploy military personnel in the next month to Ukraine to help with training, and I\'m wondering if that\'s something that the U.S. is considering -- any measures to help Ukraine with military training?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the United States continues to be concerned by ongoing violations of the Minsk Implementation Plan by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We have seen repeatedly that these Russian-backed separatists have continued to violate the terms of the agreement despite the fact that they made firm commitments in the context of an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, we have seen Russian military vehicles -- I\'m sorry -- we have seen Russian military personnel have participated in the recent attacks on Vuhlehirsk and Debaltseve. And the Russian military has put in place a robust command structure in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We know this because separatist fighters have also previously acknowledged that they are operating under instructions from Moscow.</p>\n<p>Russia and the separatists it backs have acted in direct contravention of the Minsk Implementation Plan that they agreed to.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to call on all signatories to carry out the commitments undertaken in the plan in the September Minsk Agreements fully and without delay.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we\'re concerned about is that there are reports that Russian-backed separatists have prevented members of the OSCE special monitoring mission from getting full access to the conflict areas.\xc2\xa0 There are even some reports that indicate that those separatists have made grave threats against members of the OSCE monitoring team.\xc2\xa0 So we have seen continued behavior that is in direct violation of the agreement that Russia and the other parties signed just a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we continue to be concerned about the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates in terms of assistance that we will provide to the Ukrainians at this point other than to remind you that we have already provided substantial assistance to the Ukrainian military and we have already provided substantial economic assistance to the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 And there was additional assistance the administration believes we should provide and that is why we have called on the United States Congress to pass legislation that would offer additional loan guarantees to the Ukrainians to strengthen their economy while they try to deal with this continuing instability in the eastern part of the nation.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Back on DHS, if I may.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell is apparently shopping a compromise on the Hill right now to try to move forward on that.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House looking to find a compromise, or are you still certain you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have a clean bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, the administration has been clear that we stand ready to compromise with members of Congress, including Republicans, when it comes to trying to address the many problems caused by our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we spent a lot of time over the last couple of years trying to reach that compromise, and in the United States Senate, we succeeded in doing so, that we got more than a dozen Republican senators to sign on to a compromise bipartisan immigration reform proposal.\xc2\xa0 That was a proposal that was blocked by House Republicans, even though we knew that had the House Republican leadership allowed it to come to the floor, it would have passed with bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>So we do stand ready to have those kinds of conversations with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t compromise our homeland security just because Republicans want to pick a political fight.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is not responsible.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with the Senate Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations to send a signal to the American people that Republican leadership shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cscary -- that\xe2\x80\x99s his word, not mine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Republicans will do the responsible thing, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll join with Democrats to support a full-year extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security prior to the deadline.\xc2\xa0 And then if there are Republicans that want to have a legitimate conversation with the administration about how to solve the problems that are created by our broken immigration system, then we stand ready to do that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d even host those meetings right here at the White House if they would like.</p>\n<p>Fred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 As far as the meeting today with the leader of Qatar, there are reports that Qatar has lent support to Hamas in the past.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s an issue with the President meeting with the leader of Qatar while not meeting with the leader of Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Fred, I can tell you that -- let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to Prime Minister Netanyahu, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said this many times, there is no foreign leader with whom the President has spent more time than Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 And that is a testament to the deep and ongoing security relationship that exists between the United States and Israel.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has said that the level of security coordination between the United States and Israel under the leadership of President Obama is unprecedented, and we certainly would share that assessment.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the leader of Qatar, I can tell you that there are a number of important interests that we share with Qatar.\xc2\xa0 Like all partnerships, especially in this region of the world, the United States does not necessarily agree with the Qatari government on every issue, but we have the kind of relationship that allows us to be frank and open about where we disagree and why.\xc2\xa0 But the bottom line is that our interests with Qatar converge somewhat more often than they actually diverge; that Qatar has been a significant help on a range of regional issues, including Afghanistan, Iran.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Qataris have even agreed to host a regional training site for the moderate Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly welcome the efforts of the Qataris to participate in this broad international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also know that the Qataris have indicated a willingness to work closely with us in other aspects of our strategy against ISIL, too, particularly as it relates to terror financing.\xc2\xa0 And this is a focal point of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to shut down terrorism across the globe, but it certainly is an important part of our strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL -- that if we can shut off the financing of their operations, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to add even further strain to their ability to carry out the terrible things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them do.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with the Qataris on that aspect of our strategy, too.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is precisely why the President convened the meeting with him in the Oval Office today.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the same subject, do you acknowledge that Qatar has been a significant source of especially private donations to ISIS and other terrorist groups?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, what we acknowledge is that there are areas where we disagree with the Qataris, but more often we find that our interests overlap, that our interests with the Qataris are consistent.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our work with the international community to try to ease the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, to dealing with the situation in Afghanistan, or even the ongoing campaign against ISIL, that there are a variety of ways in which the United States has been able to work effectively with the Qataris to protect and advance our national security interests in the region and around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for a long time, the Qataris have been accused of trying to play it both ways -- of welcoming hate preachers, as we might call them, to their biggest mosque, of continuing the financing, and only really trying to stop it when pressure is put on.\xc2\xa0 So can you say whether pressure is on them now to stop that financing and whether there has been any progress either in that area or with supporting these people that come in and preach against Jews and other faiths?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I can tell you that the administration does continue to work closely with the Qataris to try to improve our efforts to shut down the financing for terror operations.\xc2\xa0 And the Qataris have been an effective partner in that endeavor so far, but we do believe that there is more that they can do and more that we can do together to shut down the financing of terror operations around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was that made clear today to them, that they can do more?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed readout of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 It just ended.\xc2\xa0 But you can check with my NSC colleagues to see if you can get a better sense of how this issue was discussed in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And shortly after the video came out of the burning of the Jordanian pilot, it was said that this could be a way to bring in more of the Arab participation.\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate that happening?\xc2\xa0 Because really it\xe2\x80\x99s only been about 3 percent of the airstrikes have come from Arab partners and other countries.\xc2\xa0 Do you see that growing?\xc2\xa0 It just seems like it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed for the duration of this.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I think there are a lot of different ways to evaluate this, and certainly the easiest way to evaluate this is to take a close look at the way in which Arab countries have participated in our military operations against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And as we pointed out on a number of occasions, there are important Arab partners who are taking action alongside American military pilots to strike ISIL targets in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome that contribution and it is making a tangible contribution to our ongoing effort and to our broader strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There also was an important role for them, for our partners in the region, to play when it comes to shutting down ISIL financing; that there is a lot of money that\xe2\x80\x99s moving through that region -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the black market for oil to other sources of illicit financing for their operations.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re also working with the Qataris and other regional partners to combat ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to move foreign fighters into that region.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the President convened a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss this important issue last fall.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with our partners around the globe and in the region on those efforts.\xc2\xa0 And we also work with Muslim leaders in the region to try to counter the extremist ideology that ISIL propagated on social media; that there is an important role for more moderate voices in the Muslim world to stand up and to use their influence to try to counter that messaging.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the influence of political leaders in that effort as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And really quickly, on Bob McDonald misstating his past service -- does that bother the President or the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I can tell you that, obviously, as you know, Secretary McDonald went to West Point.\xc2\xa0 He served in the 82nd Airborne.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who, when he was in the military, completed jungle, arctic, and desert warfare training.\xc2\xa0 So he is somebody who understands firsthand the sacrifice that our men and women in uniform make on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He is also somebody who understands firsthand about why what he said about his service was wrong, and that certainly is why it was appropriate for him to apologize.\xc2\xa0 But there is no reason to think that the mistake that he made should interfere with his ability to continue to lead the fight for our veterans and to continue to implement the kinds of reforms at the VA that are so critical to making sure that our veterans are getting the benefits that they deserve.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 First, yesterday I asked you about whether or not the President would be calling congressional leaders to the White House to try to work out some agreement to prevent the Homeland Security shutdown from happening.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of any meeting like that that\'s planned at this point.\xc2\xa0 But like I said, I believe that members of Congress are still returning from their week-long recess last week and once they\xe2\x80\x99re all back in town, if it\'s necessary for the President to bring some of them down to the White House and have a conversation about this, then we\'ll do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it would be productive given what you just said about how the President has been out of the Senate for a number of years, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get engaged in these questions of procedural --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the point is that it\'s their responsibility to work this through.\xc2\xa0 And again, Republicans spent a lot of time trying to persuade the American people that they should be entrusted with the reins of the United States Congress and be entrusted with the power of the purse.\xc2\xa0 And we need to see if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to step up and assume responsibility.</p>\n<p>Again, there are probably going to be some times over the course of this year where Republicans in Congress are going to have to make some really tough decisions and take some really difficult votes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not really sure why funding the Department of Homeland Security and making sure that that funding doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lapse is considered a difficult task.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, this is a challenge for Republican leaders to decide if they can demonstrate to the American public that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to act in the country\xe2\x80\x99s best interests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Iran nuclear talks, you said that the White House is not negotiating for a 10-year sunset, basically, a 10-year -- a point where Iran would be able to become effectively a nuclear power.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration, is the White House, the President opposed to a timeline that is so short?\xc2\xa0 You said you\'re not pushing for it, you\'re not arguing for it, you\'re not negotiating for it.\xc2\xa0 But is that a non-starter?\xc2\xa0 Is that something you would not agree to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jon, I\'ve used this analogy on other occasions, or on other topics.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not something that you and I can negotiate from here, that ultimately we\'re going to have a conversation with the Iranians about the way that they can resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>At this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s not more detail that I can share about the negotiating position of the United States other than to say that those reports from earlier today were not accurate and did not accurately reflect our negotiating.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand why you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate it here, obviously, but this seems to be a pretty fundamental question.\xc2\xa0 The report that you now said was inaccurate, but I\'m trying to get how much of -- I don\'t want to use the word red line, but how much of an absolute non-starter that is.\xc2\xa0 The report suggested a deal taking place with the Iranians after a period of just 10 years, where it would basically have no restrictions on their ability to enrich uranium.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just asking if that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I know that\'s not the position you\'re trying to get, but is that simply unacceptable?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what is unacceptable is the idea that Iran would obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that has been our policy for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And the whole purpose of these negotiations is to make sure that Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is that it would be terribly destabilizing for the region.\xc2\xa0 It could precipitate, and I think we could even say is likely to precipitate a nuclear arms race in what is already a very volatile region of the world.\xc2\xa0 That would not be in the best interests of American national security, and it certainly would not be in the best interest of our closest ally in the region, Israel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s why we\'re engaged in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And once we have -- the President has indicated that the time for conducting these kinds of negotiations is running short, and so once we\'ve sort of reached the other end of these things, we can have a more detailed conversation about what that deal is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you confirm --there was some confusion about the deadline.\xc2\xa0 Is the deadline for these talks March 24th, as White House officials have suggested in the past, or is it March 31st?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You mean March 24th or 31st?\xc2\xa0 I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0 -- I\'ve always heard people say it\'s the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 So let me see if I can get back to you with a specific -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s a date certain.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one quick thing.\xc2\xa0 The Republican leaders have said that the President vetoing Keystone would be a political move to please environmental extremists.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason the President will veto this legislation that has passed the Congress is that it circumvents a longstanding administrative process for evaluating whether or not infrastructure projects like this are in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 And it does not represent a specific position on the pipeline itself.\xc2\xa0 It just merely says that the benefits, the consequences of building that pipeline should be thoroughly evaluated by experts and through this administrative process that has existed for decades and has been used by previous Presidents of both parties to evaluate similar infrastructure projects.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the proper path moving forward, but does not represent a final disposition of the Keystone project.</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know the Vice President and the Secretary of State will be out of town next week during the start of -- actually during the whole AIPAC conference.\xc2\xa0 Will an administration official be addressing the AIPAC conference at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more information on that soon.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ve received an invitation from AIPAC and we\'ll get back to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we should expect just a name -- it\'s not whether you\'re going to have an administration official attend the conference.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just a matter of figuring out which administration official actually addresses AIPAC?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think -- we have received the invitation from AIPAC.\xc2\xa0 We\'re considering the invitation.\xc2\xa0 And once we\'ve made a decision we\'ll get back to AIPAC about who the speakers will be, and then we\'ll be in a position to talk about it.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has expressed more optimism about bipartisan -- (inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 Can you explain whether it\'s just Democrats coming?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s been invited and what the President\xe2\x80\x99s hopes are for that legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, I would anticipate that we\'ll have a list of lawmakers who participate in that meeting.\xc2\xa0 Both Democrats and Republicans were invited, and I would anticipate that there will be a bipartisan group of members at the meeting. The President, as you point out, does view this as an opportunity for us to find some common ground to move the country forward; that there are some Republicans who have raised similar concerns that the President himself has discussed about our criminal justice system, about reforms that could make our system more consistent with our values of fairness and justice and equality that certainly the President believes are really important, and I know that many of the members -- that all the members who are participating in the meeting also believe are important.</p>\n<p>So this is an area that\'s worthy of careful consideration and consultation because there might be an opportunity for Congress to act in bipartisan fashion with the strong support of the President to put in place reforms to our system that would make our nation more just.\xc2\xa0 So the President is looking forward to that discussion.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that we\'ll have, like I said, a list of the members who participate and at least a general overview of that meeting once it concludes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, yesterday, Governor Fallin, after she met with the National Governors Association, with the President, reported that the President said he was \xe2\x80\x9copen to crude exports from the U.S.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate characterization of what the President told the governors?\xc2\xa0 And is that sort of a shift in position from what he has previously said?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the room when that exchange occurred, so it\'s hard for me to accurately reflect the way the question was asked and the way it was answered.\xc2\xa0 What I can do, though, is assure you that the policy of the administration has not changed, that crude oil export regulations are administered by the Department of Commerce.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where these kinds of regulations are considered.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have sort of change to announce at this point.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Iran, is it the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that you would want a permanent agreement, one that has no timeline whatsoever, to meet the goal that you said repeatedly, which is to ensure there\xe2\x80\x99s never a development of a nuclear weapon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we want is we want an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s verifiable and we certainly want one that all parties live up to.\xc2\xa0 And again, in terms of what kind of time constraints are placed in the context of the negotiations and how long people would be signing up, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to prejudge or be in a position to talk about from here.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is the subject of ongoing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- answer suggests that the administration is open to a timeline of some kind.\xc2\xa0 It has to be one or the other.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I recognize that.\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to be in a position to talk about the details of our negotiating position with the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply that we have agreed on the front end with our international partners who are joining us at the table and with the Iranians that we can have an open, candid dialogue in the context of these negotiations with the goal of trying to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And attempts to try to influence those negotiations by talking about them outside of the context of the negotiations are not going to be helpful to that process.</p>\n<p>But my point is, we will have an opportunity at some point, -- on or around the end of March, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to discuss either the framework for an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to discuss why we were not able to reach an agreement despite the common-sense, reasonable proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s been put forward by the international community.\xc2\xa0 And your interest in understanding exactly what was put forward is a reasonable one, but one that I can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just ask you this:\xc2\xa0 Have you reconciled in your own mind how you could describe to the country an agreement that had a timeline that also met the standard of Iran never obtaining a nuclear weapon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, once --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re almost irreconcilable.\xc2\xa0 Can both be true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the most important thing is to figure out what exactly Iran will agree to, and understand whether or not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- whether or not Iran can obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- and whether or not it will resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>So that is the focal point of these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And again, once we are in a position to evaluate either an agreement that has been reached, or an offer that was made an then rejected by the Iranians, we can talk in more detail about the negotiating position that was assumed by the United States and our international partners, and how it was possible to reconcile that with the policy goals that we have stated, the most important of which you\xe2\x80\x99ve reiterated here, which is to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Secretary McDonald -- a couple of veterans groups have said they accept his apology, but said it raises questions in their minds about his trustworthiness.\xc2\xa0 And they don\xe2\x80\x99t talk just about this, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve also made mention of misstatements that the Secretary may have intentionally or unintentionally made about how many people have been fired and held accountable in some of the implementation of reforms.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied that Secretary McDonald is trustworthy and is, in fact, implementing all of the reforms and legislation he recently signed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Secretary McDonald has a very difficult task in front of him to try to bring much-needed reforms to the VA.\xc2\xa0 And this is a task that generations of VA secretaries have tried to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 Many of them have made progress, and the President is pleased with the progress that Secretary McDonald has made so far.</p>\n<p>But again, this is a very difficult challenge.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that Secretary McDonald has been successful so far is that not only does he bring with him some private sector management experience that I do think is useful when trying to get his arms around a large government agency like this and manage it efficiently, or at least as efficiently as possible, this task also reflects his own personal commitment to these issues that starts with his own military service to our country.\xc2\xa0 But even after he left military service, Secretary McDonald was committed, even using his free time, to try to support military families, our veterans and their families.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to his character.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to what drives him, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s well suited for this job.</p>\n<p>But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who sits around -- who wakes up in the morning thinking, boy, my job is really hard today, I wish I could just go walk in Bob McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s shoes because that sure would be a weight off my shoulders.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody recognizes that he\xe2\x80\x99s a got a very difficult task in front of him.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why his skill and personal commitment to these issues are so important to his success.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the VA was in a lot of trouble, the President tasked Rob Nabors to go over and assist.\xc2\xa0 Is he still there?\xc2\xa0 Is he still working in carrying out essentially a conduit role from the White House to the VA, and serving as that sort of presidential intermediary or liaison with this new Secretary?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Rob is still working at the VA and is still providing the Secretary and other members of the senior leadership at the VA the kind of advice and expertise that they continue to benefit from.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are pleased to have Rob still serving his country and our veterans over at the VA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain raised his concerns about the Choice Card, which is part of the legislation the President signed.\xc2\xa0 We had a couple of questions at the budget briefing, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear that every member of Congress is satisfied that this Choice Card is going to be implemented in the budget and the financial flexibility is going to be there for veterans to obtain care outside of the system if they meet the criteria. \xc2\xa0Can you assure veterans, from this podium, that, in fact, financing will be there and the Choice Card will be implemented fully as written by Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not intimately familiar with this issue, so let me take this question for the VA and see if we can provide you some data to help you understand our position on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to take you back to Keystone for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Is there any way in your mind, if the process plays out -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve made the point that this has sort of circumvented longstanding processes -- if they were to play out, in your mind, is there any way the President signs off on the Keystone XL?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That possibility still does exist.\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing review that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to evaluate the impact that this project would have on the country.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have the opportunity to evaluate the impact that this project would have on contributing to climate change.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly is possible; the President will keep an open mind as the State Department considers the wide range of impacts that this pipeline could have on the country, both positive and negative.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens once the State Department has completed their - what\xe2\x80\x99s called the national interest determination - what essentially is a report evaluating whether or not the completion of this infrastructure project would be in the best interest of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said as far as Israel was concerned there\xe2\x80\x99s a deep, longstanding security relationship between our country and theirs.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, as it relates to the Iranian talks, is it fair to characterize a level of frustration on behalf of the administration to this notion that some people are cherry-picking bits and pieces and maybe as an outside actor attempting to influence the negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I think you asked about this last week, I believe, where I did express some frustration that we have seen some people take information that they had obtained about the U.S. negotiating position and cherry-pick information to try to distort the public impression of exactly what that negotiating position was.\xc2\xa0 So that is why, at least, even in the context of the questions that I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken today, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been loathe to get into the details of the U.S. negotiating position. Everybody will have an opportunity to evaluate that soon enough.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as the details come out, albeit you\xe2\x80\x99re saying they\xe2\x80\x99re not accurate, you can understand why many perhaps in Israel might say, you see, this is exactly what we were talking about to begin with.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what people around the globe can be confident of is that the United States is negotiating with one clear goal in mind, which is to make sure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And we are working closely with the international community to achieve that goal.\xc2\xa0 That was the goal of the sanctions regime that Congress passed and this administration implemented in close coordination with our allies around the globe, to compel the Iranians to come to the negotiating table and try to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And those talks are underway, and we certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything that I say from here or any other efforts to try to distort our negotiating position to negatively impact our ability to try to bring those negotiations to conclusion in a way that yields a strong and verifiable agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of not just the United States and not just Israel and not just our international negotiating partners, but is clearly in the best interest of the whole country -- or of the whole globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick housekeeping.\xc2\xa0 As far as AIPAC is concerned, there is zero chance that someone won\xe2\x80\x99t be going to AIPAC, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they have extended an invitation to the administration; once we have decided how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to respond to the invitation, we will let them know.\xc2\xa0 And then once we let them know, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let all of you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you will accept it, someone is going, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somebody is going, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I hear you.\xc2\xa0 It does seem just as a matter of common courtesy, it seems like we should respond to their invitation first and then we can talk about it publicly.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting that no one is going?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t come close to saying that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you did.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a question a different way.\xc2\xa0 Given the President is going to make obviously the final call on XL, is there no communication between the White House and State Department about when you might expect their report?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for every single conversation that occurs between the White House and the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that somebody in the White House has gotten an update in terms of how much longer it would take the State Department to compete their review, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But even if I were, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d be in a position to announce for the State Department what their timeline is going to be.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to announce a timeline then they\xe2\x80\x99ll announce it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, there are a lot of people anxious about this.\xc2\xa0 They waited six years and there are others who are concerned about a political implication for 2016 depending on when the President does make his decision.\xc2\xa0 Is the expectation that once the State Department report comes out, the President will make a decision fairly quickly?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like he needs to do that quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the outcome here, but I would anticipate that once the review has been completed that there would not be a significant delay in announcing the results of that review and ultimately making a decision on this project.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on DHS, as you know, there are critics who have suggested that the White House has overstated the potential impact if there\xe2\x80\x99s a delay in funding, saying that because everyone who is essential will still be working that it won\xe2\x80\x99t make a significant difference to national security.\xc2\xa0 The White House\xe2\x80\x99s -- you and others have said that obviously an impact would occur.\xc2\xa0 And we heard from some people, including the FEMA Director yesterday, about what that would be.\xc2\xa0 So given that, what kind of preparations are underway for a possible shutdown? And is the White House confident that DHS is ready, should that occur?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the administration who is making the case that shutting down the Department of Homeland Security would have a bad impact on national security.\xc2\xa0 I know that Congressman Peter King was on television today making exactly that case.\xc2\xa0 So he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often agree with the administration, but at least in this case he\xe2\x80\x99s making the same case that we are.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s making that case.</p>\n<p>I do know that the Department of Homeland Security has been engaged in a planning process to ensure they are prepared and can take the steps necessary to try to mitigate the impact of a shutdown of that department.\xc2\xa0 But as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned before, the impact of that shutdown will include tens of thousands of Homeland Security personnel being furloughed.\xc2\xa0 It will include many Homeland Security officers showing up for work to protect their country but not getting a paycheck on time.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem particularly fair, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why anybody thinks that would be a good outcome for the country.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that this is not a good thing.\xc2\xa0 But DHS is doing the responsible thing, which is, even as they try to talk to members of Congress and encourage them to fulfill their responsibility and pass a budget, they\xe2\x80\x99re also engaged in the planning to try to mitigate the potential impact of shutting down their agency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s involved in that planning?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t, but they probably can.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A few days ago, a Mexican citizen was killed by two police officers in Pasco, Washington.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of the incident?\xc2\xa0 Or the White House?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Can you say it one more time?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A Mexican citizen was killed in Pasco, Washington, the state of Washington.\xc2\xa0 My question was, was the President aware of the incident, or the White House, and what is the reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen the news reports.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he is aware, although knowing he\xe2\x80\x99s an avid consumer of news, I assume that he is.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a lot of the details of the case beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read in news reports.\xc2\xa0 So for questions about sort of where that investigation stands, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the local authorities there.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that you continue to be concerned by these violations.\xc2\xa0 And the President said when Merkel was visiting that if Russia continued to do this he would seriously consider sending arms to the Ukrainian government and also possibly increasing the sanctions. So you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing these violations.\xc2\xa0 Now what are you going to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now is we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to support the ongoing efforts to try to implement this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And I know that there was a call that was scheduled among the foreign ministerial level of the four groups that have been involved in these negotiations -- the Russians, the Ukrainians, the French and the Germans --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that was yesterday -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was yesterday or today, but I know that those efforts are ongoing and we continue to support them.\xc2\xa0 And the consequences that you cited of failing to live up to those kinds of commitments continue to be on the table.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to closely watch the situation with the President, the Vice President, and other senior members of the team, continue to be in close touch with our partners who are working this situation and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to monitor it closely.\xc2\xa0 But certainly there is the potential of offering additional assistance to the Ukrainian military or ramping up our sanctions regime against the Russians.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, right now they\xe2\x80\x99re violating it.\xc2\xa0 How long will they go on violating it until you do something?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, how long do you give this process?\xc2\xa0 I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re not living up to it now.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring it.\xc2\xa0 How long are you going to monitor the violations before you do something?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to try to work diplomatically to resolve this situation.\xc2\xa0 And that has been our approach from the beginning, which is that it is our view that the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to resolve this is not with a military solution but with a diplomatic solution.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to press that option.</p>\n<p>But, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, at some point you have to start considering some other alternatives, which is why the United States has already provided substantial military assistance to the Ukrainian military.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve already worked with our partners in Europe to put in place a sanctions regime and isolate President Putin and -- or Russian political leadership.\xc2\xa0 And that was a response to their earlier violations of generally accepted international norms.</p>\n<p>But, yes, the potential of increasing our assistance to Ukraine and increasing the costs that are sustained by Russia has the potential to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to watch this and make decisions accordingly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is it also possible that these violations could continue and you decide to do nothing else?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think our level of pessimism is not quite that high, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say there\xe2\x80\x99s the potential that you might do something else.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, if the violations continue, might you also decide that it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth doing anything else on sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Based on our past response to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s provocations and failure to live up to generally accepted international principles, I think you could rightly conclude that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that that is the outcome.\xc2\xa0 But as we see Russia continue to destabilize eastern Ukraine and continue to take steps that are clearly in violation of agreements that they\xe2\x80\x99ve signed, that the risk of further sanctions only increases.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to come back to Iran one more time.\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear about what you\xe2\x80\x99re denying.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re denying that the United States has proposed a 10-year agreement, is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding of the reports -- that I will confess that I have not seen firsthand -- but my understanding of the reports indicate that -- they wrongly indicate that the agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated right now will be 10 years in length, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not our negotiating position at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not denying that there is some substantially longer agreement of which there is a 10-year opening phase to it, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to do is to sort of wade in on a detailed assessment of where the negotiations currently stand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking for details.\xc2\xa0 Just are you denying something longer?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly more detail than we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about so far.\xc2\xa0 But again, we will have an opportunity in the coming weeks to consider either to evaluate an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached, or to evaluate an agreement that the Iranians walked away from.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say the United States continues to negotiate from the position that there should be an opportunity for the Iranians to ease the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program to, in a verifiable way, make clear to the international community that they will not acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Iranians have said many times that that is consistent with their view and with their national policy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the international community that they just need to be able to verify that for the international community.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, if we can come to an agreement around those outlines that would be a good outcome for not just the United States and Israel, but it would be good for the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we follow on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At this point, would you still call on Prime Minister Netanyahu to cancel the speech before the Congress?\xc2\xa0 And if so, would the President meet with Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Connie, we have not called on Prime Minister Netanyahu to cancel his speech.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated the reason that the President will not meet with him during this visit to the United States is that it comes just two weeks before his election.\xc2\xa0 And in order to avoid even the appearance of interfering with a democratic election in another country, the President will not meet with the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that at some point after the elections, regardless of who wins, that the President will convene a meeting with the leader of Israel and will continue the very close coordination on security issues that has characterized his relationship thus far with Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>\n<p>JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the United States and her allies try to come to an agreement with Iran about its nuclear ambitions, what is this administration doing -- how is it engaged to reduce nuclear weapons in nations that actually do have these weapons, like China and North Korea, Russia, Pakistan, et cetera?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, JC, the President -- I think each of those situations is a little bit different.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly have even worked closely with Russia to reduce our nuclear stockpile, and this is something that the President did early in his tenure.\xc2\xa0 And that, he believes, is in the best interest of not just U.S. national security, but also the safety of citizens and people around the globe.\xc2\xa0 But, certainly, we continue to be focused on these issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last Friday, a federal judge appointed by President Obama issued an injunction on a separate immigration executive action, specifically stopping the detention of migrants coming across the border in Texas.\xc2\xa0 Is the Department of Justice going to seek a stay of this injunction in the same way they are seeking a stay --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with DOJ about sort of the next step in that legal process.\xc2\xa0 I do know that the issue in question in that legal proceeding was related to our efforts to address what at the time was a rather urgent situation that we saw a substantial number of unaccompanied minors at the southern border attempting to illegally enter the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And one of our efforts to try to respond to that situation was to detain recent border-crossers near the border, and to try to find an environment in which families could be detained together, and to try to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that in the most humane way possible.</p>\n<p>So I know that there are some who raised concerns about that policy, but that is what the administration believed was an appropriate way to respond to that urgent situation.</p>\n<p>Since that time, we have seen the numbers of undocumented immigrants, particularly unaccompanied minors, in that sector of the border decline substantially.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s thanks to the comprehensive strategy that this administration has put in place, working with Central American countries, working with our partners in Mexico, and stepping up some of our law enforcement capabilities on the border to try to address the situation.\xc2\xa0 And that situation has -- or at least the urgency of the situation down there has subsided dramatically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- your administration argued that this detention served as a deterrent to make sure that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t another ongoing flood of migrants.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the comprehensive strategy you just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration at all concerned now that this deterrent is gone, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see another wave of migrants?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only deterrent. I think the most effective deterrent that we have is to have the President of the United States making very clear that people in Central America should not send their kids on this very dangerous journey; that too often, we saw reports of kids who didn\xe2\x80\x99t complete the journey safely, that they were killed.\xc2\xa0 This is a very dangerous trek.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, we saw the kids were actually funneled into human trafficking rings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to make the case very clearly and very publicly that parents should not even contemplate to putting their kids in the hands of human traffickers in trying to move them into the United States illegally.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been really clear about that, and that is probably the most effective deterrent that we have.\xc2\xa0 But to the extent that other things can also deter and reinforce that message, we obviously want to support them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Budget Office sent a letter to Thad Cochran, scoring the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions for DACA and DAPA, and it found that his executive actions would actually increase budget deficits by $8.8 billion over the next 10 years. I was wondering if you could square that CBO finding with the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, which claims immigration reform and executive actions would reduce the budget.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We may have to follow up with you on this,\xc2\xa0 because my reading of that report was actually that removing the executive actions would actually add $8 billion to the deficit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Off-budget, you\'re right.\xc2\xa0 That\'s if we don\'t consider -- that\'s if the payroll taxes from the DAPA and DACA recipients didn\'t go to the Social Security trust fund.\xc2\xa0 But if the Social Security trust fund exists, if those payroll taxes are going to the Social Security trust fund, then that CBO letter found that the immigration actions do add to the deficit by $8.8 billion over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I may have somebody who is more steeped in the budgetary details.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that this would have a positive impact on our deficit precisely because for the first time what we\xe2\x80\x99d be doing is we\xe2\x80\x99d be bringing people out of the shadows and actually making them pay taxes.\xc2\xa0 That would be a good thing for the life of Social Security.\xc2\xa0 It would be a good thing for our economy.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, it would be a good thing for the deficit.\xc2\xa0 But we can have somebody follow up with you on your -- on what may be a more detailed question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on Keystone, does President Obama believe that 2,300 days is a reasonable length of time for the State Department to conduct an evaluation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly fair to suggest that the State Department is conducting an in-depth review.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The other thing that is also true is that there have been some legal proceedings that have interfered with the completion of this review.\xc2\xa0 There was this long-running court case in Nebraska about the proper route of the pipeline.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly did impact the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s ability to evaluate the route of the pipeline since it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finalized and was subject to this ultimate court ruling.</p>\n<p>But within just the last few weeks the Nebraska court has issued a decision that has finalized the proposal, and now that final proposal can be evaluated by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they\'re doing right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you imagine what he would say if he gave you an assignment and you said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you in 2,300 days?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I can\'t.</p>\n<p>Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions here.\xc2\xa0 One, when last year Prime Minister Modi came to the United States, late last year -- and including at the United Nations and at the White House, at the U.N. he announced that India should be a member of the U.N. Security Council, and which President in India also announced and endorsed.\xc2\xa0 What is happening with that membership?</p>\n<p>And also Prime Minister Modi addressed in Washington the U.S.-India Business Council and calling on the Fortune 500 companies make in India, which will create thousands of jobs in the U.S. and thousands of jobs in India.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with that issue?\xc2\xa0 And the two leaders also set up a hotline.\xc2\xa0 The two have spoken ever since his visit to the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Goyal, I can tell you as it relates to India\xe2\x80\x99s membership on the Security Council, I know the President endorsed them acceding to the Security Council in the context of a variety of other important reforms to the operations of the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you on the status of those ongoing reforms, or at least efforts to try to bring about some of those reforms.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure my colleagues in Ambassador Power\xe2\x80\x99s office can give you some additional information on this.</p>\n<p>Goyal, the President often discusses his view that we need to have more products that are stamped with Made in America and that that would be good for the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 It would be good for job creation.\xc2\xa0 The President also does believe that, as Indian consumers have the opportunity to buy American goods, that it could be good for the Indian economy, as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President did have the opportunity to discuss some of these economic issues and our trade relationship with India.\xc2\xa0 In the context of his visit to India just last month, the President spent a lot of time with Prime Minister Modi and they spent a lot of time talking about some of these economic issues.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that there was a CEO summit in the context of those meeting, and that there were American and Indian business leaders that spent some time talking through some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 And the President himself had the opportunity to sit down at a roundtable with a couple dozen of them and talk about some of the challenges that they face as they try to do more business together in a way that benefits the economies and job creation in both countries.</p>\n<p>So there is an opportunity for us to try to advance the interests of both our countries by working together and by coordinating our efforts.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly committed to that, again, in part, because the substantial economic benefits that could be enjoyed by the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is his goal.</p>\n<p>I know that Prime Minister Modi has a similar interest. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t know of any recent conversations that they have had, but that continues to be a priority of both the President and his administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, Josh, as far as the immigration is concerned, when President issued executive order millions of people were happy in that they will come out of the shadow.\xc2\xa0 Now they\'re confused.\xc2\xa0 What message you think President has for them?\xc2\xa0 They are waiting to come out of the shadow and apply for their status.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Goyal, this is something that we are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 The President does believe and we have said on many occasions that we believe that there is a very clear precedent for the executive actions the President announced at the end of last year; that taking executive action to try to address some elements of our broken immigration system is consistent with the way that Presidents of both parties for several decades have used their executive authority.</p>\n<p>And there is no doubt that these kinds of changes would be good for our economy, would be good for job creation, and would be good for bringing about greater accountability to our immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is what the President believes is the benefit here -- that we can bring millions of people out of the shadows, that we can make them submit to a background check, that they will pay taxes, and that they can also get a work permit and they can start contributing to this country in a way that doesn\'t require them to live in fear of being deported at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice and separated from their families.</p>\n<p>Now, this, of course, does not apply to people who have recently crossed the border.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we want to focus our enforcement efforts on people who have recently crossed the border and on others who may pose a threat to community safety or national security.\xc2\xa0 But that is the crux of this debate, and we\'re going to continue to move this through the legal process because we\'re confident that the strongest legal arguments around on our side.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M.
