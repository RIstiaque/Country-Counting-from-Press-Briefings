Brady Press Briefing Room</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t11:58 A.M. EST</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Thanks for being here. \xc2\xa0Or good morning still, right? \xc2\xa0Just barely. \xc2\xa0Good day, ladies and gentlemen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs you know, the President, not long from now, will be heading to Virginia where he will meet with a family that is one of the many, many thousands of families that submitted their stories to #My2K -- part of that effort to explain what tax cuts for the middle class would mean for them. \xc2\xa0There is a document available online that lays out what raising taxes on the middle class would do to Virginians.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tOn January 1st, as you know, income taxes are scheduled to go up for 2.9 million middle-class Virginia families. \xc2\xa0And tax cuts, such as the expanded child tax credit, the 10 percent tax bracket, marriage penalty relief, and the American Opportunity Tax Credit would all expire. \xc2\xa0If Congress fails to act, every American family\xe2\x80\x99s taxes will automatically increase, including the 98 percent of Virginia families who make less than $250,000 a year and the 97 percent of American small businesses that earn less than $250,000 a year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tA typical Virginia family of four earning $86,000 could see its income taxes rise by $2,200. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, unacceptable. \xc2\xa0To do that to 98 percent of the American people because of an insistence that the wealthiest Americans get a tax cut would be profoundly wrong and profoundly bad policy. \xc2\xa0It would have a negative impact on those families across the country and a negative impact on the economy. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President will, as he has done consistently, urge the House of Representatives to take action, to follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead to extend tax cuts next year for 98 percent of the American people, and by doing so, to take a significant step towards dealing with the fiscal cliff.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions. \xc2\xa0Ben.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Jay. \xc2\xa0Regarding the phone call between the President and the Speaker of the House, how would you characterize it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it. \xc2\xa0As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give readouts of phone calls and conversations and meetings. \xc2\xa0Our interest here is in working with Congress, working with numerous stakeholders towards the goal of achieving a compromised deal that averts the fiscal cliff and does the important work of putting together a balanced package that achieves $4 trillion in deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President spoke with Speaker of the House Boehner as he has in the past and as he will in the future. \xc2\xa0But beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a characterization.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last week there had been a report, which it sounds like you disputed at the time, that the last call was curt, and a different characterization in the length of the call were not even to the point where you could --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a characterization to dispute today, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was curt. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Okay, I applaud that. \xc2\xa0That was good.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI honestly have no -- nothing more to offer except to confirm that there was a phone conversation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0From the view of the White House, can you say where we are? \xc2\xa0I ask because Cantor said yesterday that we\xe2\x80\x99re nowhere, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense -- there\xe2\x80\x99s at least a sense in this town right now that talks are not going well or that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t talks. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the Speaker and the President spoke, but in a broad sense for the public can you give us an update about where we are?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a few things about that. \xc2\xa0First of all, I think in my briefing yesterday, the sense of -- the consensus here was the fact that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t report a conversation between the Speaker of the House and the President of the United States was proof that talks were nowhere; as you know, shortly after that, we were confirming a talk between the President and the Speaker.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHowever, it is our view that simply having conversations with congressional leaders will not produce a deal. \xc2\xa0What will produce a deal is an acknowledgement by Republicans, Republican leaders, that rates on the top 2 percent -- the wealthiest Americans -- have to rise. \xc2\xa0There is no deal without that acknowledgement and without a concrete, mathematically sound proposal around which both sides can come together and get this done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, the fact is, conversations continue. \xc2\xa0Lines of communication remain open between the White House and Congress. \xc2\xa0Multiple other conversations and communications continue to occur as we press for an agreement. \xc2\xa0And I would simply note if you take a step back that in the wake of the election we have seen an acknowledgement by Republicans of all kinds -- including Republican leaders -- that revenue has to be a part of this. \xc2\xa0We acknowledged at the time that that was progress; we do to this day acknowledge that that is progress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSince then, we have seen increasing numbers of Republicans, including elected lawmakers, acknowledge that raising rates is going to have to be part of this, and we welcome that acknowledgement. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s progress. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut we\'re not there yet. \xc2\xa0What we don\xe2\x80\x99t have is a specific, concrete proposal from Republicans on the revenue side to discuss one that recognizes that rates have to go up, and one that recognizes that in order to achieve the $4 trillion deficit-reduction package that the President seeks and that every bipartisan commission says we need to achieve the goal of putting our economy on a sustainable fiscal path requires a certain size of revenue to make it balanced and fair.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One question on Governor Christie\'s meeting today with the President. \xc2\xa0The Democrats on the Hill have said that the White House is pushing a supplemental in the range of $50 billion to help states that have suffered with -- through the storm. \xc2\xa0Governors in the region, including Christie, want more than that, maybe in the range of $80 billion. \xc2\xa0Can you describe the nature of this conversation between the two leaders? \xc2\xa0And also, what the White House is basing its figures on?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\'ll say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0First of all, Governor Christie had a meeting with Chief of Staff, Jack Lew; with OMB acting director, Jeff Zients; with Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Mastromonaco, and other senior members. \xc2\xa0Prior to that meeting he did meet with the President. \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a read out for you of the meeting.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President is very focused, as you know, and has directed his administration to be very focused on assisting New Jersey, New York, other affected states in their recovery efforts. \xc2\xa0And we have obligated more than $2.3 billion to support response and recovery efforts, and that includes $1 billion already approved in direct assistance to thousands of individuals affected by the storm. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe are working on a request, but that request is still being developed. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have numbers for you and I\'m not going to speculate on what that request will look like. \xc2\xa0We continue to hope that we\'ll have that request sent up soon. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up probably on both those questions. \xc2\xa0On the meeting with Governor Christie -- but did the President make a commitment that he would in fact provide a certain amount of -- a specific amount of aid in his discussions?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The request is still being worked on and still being developed, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a number for you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And on the conversation between the President and Speaker Boehner -- no readout, obviously, but can you at least give a sense of -- have both sides agreed effectively to impose a media blackout on these kinds of calls because of the sensitive nature of what they\'re dealing with?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I can\'t speak for the Speaker\'s office or the Speaker. \xc2\xa0And it\'s not a media blackout. \xc2\xa0Look, I understand; I sat among you for a long, long time, and I know there is intense interest in this process. \xc2\xa0The only reason not to read out every phone call and leak every proposal is because we believe it\'s in the interest of achieving an agreement not to do that, and I\'ve said that all along.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe\'re trying to be helpful. \xc2\xa0We have been very specific in what our proposals are, what the numbers say. \xc2\xa0We had Jason Furman here, Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council with me yesterday who briefed you in detail about why proposals that purport to be able to achieve sizable revenues just by cutting -- limiting deductions and closing loopholes upon further inspection don\xe2\x80\x99t actually achieve that in a plausible way, which is why rates have to -- rising rates for the wealthiest Americans have to be part of this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we\'re being I think very clear about what our proposals are. \xc2\xa0We\'ve been specific. \xc2\xa0But in our negotiations and our discussions, we\'re trying to actually get to a deal, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President and Speaker Boehner agree on -- or schedule a face-to-face meeting?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no announcements of meetings or phone calls to make and no characterization of the contents of the phone call.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnn.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday, Secretary Geithner said that absolutely the administration would follow through and head over the cliff if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t agreement on that upper tax rate. \xc2\xa0Is that -- does that leave the impression that going over the cliff is an acceptable alternative to the President?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a misimpression I think if you have it. \xc2\xa0The Secretary of the Treasury simply reiterated what the President and I and others have said, which is that the President won\xe2\x80\x99t accept a bad deal. \xc2\xa0He will not accept a deal that doesn\'t include rates rising for the top 2 percent. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThis is a debate that we had at length for more than a year. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99s been enormously clear about. \xc2\xa0And his insistence on that is based on sound policy, not on a simple desire to have rates to go up. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s because we need that to happen as part of a balanced package that achieves this $4 trillion deficit-reduction goal.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd that\'s an important number because the whole -- again, deficit reduction in and of itself is not the goal here. \xc2\xa0The reason to get our fiscal house in order, the reason to pass a deficit-reduction package that is balanced and allows for economic growth and job creation is to put our economy on a sustainable fiscal path, which then itself produces positive economic benefits and growth and jobs. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why that $4 trillion -- roughly that $4 trillion figure is so important. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd in order to get to $4 trillion, you need to look at the components, the legs of the stool. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that: \xc2\xa0discretionary spending cuts -- signed a trillion dollars\xe2\x80\x99 of those into law. \xc2\xa0Revenues have to be part of this -- the President has put forward a very specific proposal for $1.6 trillion in revenues. \xc2\xa0Entitlement reforms need to be a part of it. \xc2\xa0Savings gleaned from our health care entitlements and other entitlement programs need to be a part of it. \xc2\xa0The President has been specific about that. \xc2\xa0And then, of course, the positive impact of reduced-interest payments contribute to an overall deficit-reduction package.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe size of the package matters. \xc2\xa0The components of the package matter.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And when the President yesterday said that he would not \xe2\x80\x9cplay that game\xe2\x80\x9d next year with the debt ceiling, he stopped short of saying that he would insist on an agreement now as part of the -- of a fiscal cliff deal. \xc2\xa0And he also didn\'t seem to indicate that he would like to have the authority to handle debt ceiling in the future. \xc2\xa0Is he backing off of either of those?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Not at all. \xc2\xa0We think that would be -- Secretary Geithner made that clear when he presented the proposal.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the President didn\'t in his remarks to the Business Roundtable.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President, as he said and announced to you all, was speaking off the cuff; he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t reading from a prepared text. \xc2\xa0But that is our proposal -- that we end this hostage-taking cycle by taking up Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that was enacted into law as part of the Budget Control Act, and moving it forward so that we do not engage in a process where members of Congress are threatening to default on the full faith and credit of the United States in order to achieve their objectives. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I heard somebody talking about a proposal where we should do this every month -- was this Grover Norquist? \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just a profoundly bad idea that I think could not be more frightening for American businesses and American workers.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJulianna.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on that -- would the President veto a measure that would extend the tax rates for the middle class, let the rates for the top earners go up but didn\xe2\x80\x99t deal with the debt ceiling?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we think it is entirely appropriate and expect Congress to deal with the debt ceiling as part of an end-of-the-year deal. \xc2\xa0If they were to deal with it separately before the end of the year in a way that we find appropriate, that would also be fine with us. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about how the package -- how dealing with the debt ceiling in a responsible way, with no delay and no drama, takes place. \xc2\xa0What the President insists on is that Congress do its job. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tOne thing that I think is important -- and I assume that at least some ordinary Americans out there are watching -- when we talk about raising the debt ceiling, we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about spending. \xc2\xa0Congress is simply authorizing itself to pay the bills that it incurred. \xc2\xa0So if Congress wants to deal with spending, they ought to spend less. \xc2\xa0And one way to do that is to engage in this process with the President, build a $4 trillion deficit-reduction package that includes both revenues and significant spending cuts, significant savings from our entitlement programs, and pass it. \xc2\xa0And that would be a good and effective thing to deal with spending as well as our deficits. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhen you get a credit card bill you don\xe2\x80\x99t just say, well, you know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of this, I\xe2\x80\x99m not paying it anymore. \xc2\xa0I mean, you can do that, but there will be significant consequences for your personal financial future. \xc2\xa0Well, the United States of America, when it gets its bill for items it has purchased, pays those bills.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you have said that the President would veto any bill that did not extend -- that let tax cuts for the wealthy expire. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re not drawing that same line -- on the veto threat with the debt ceiling?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re confusing the process. \xc2\xa0When we talk about a bill that has to do with tax rates, he won\xe2\x80\x99t extend -- he would veto a bill if it were to get to his desk -- he would not sign a bill that extended tax rates for the wealthiest Americans.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAgain, we believe that dealing with the debt ceiling ought to be part of this end-of-the-year package. \xc2\xa0It ought to be done without delay and without drama. \xc2\xa0If it\xe2\x80\x99s done separately, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. \xc2\xa0I think the easiest way, since we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time, is to just get it done as part of an overall compromise.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just follow up on that? \xc2\xa0Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- when he says \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t play that game,\xe2\x80\x9d what role does he have in the game? \xc2\xa0In other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Congress to do this. \xc2\xa0We know what -- \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0He is not going to provide -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to engage in a negotiation with Congress where members of Congress who seem to think it is helpful for the economy to threaten default in exchange for demands. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do that. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to "play that game." \xc2\xa0I mean, you were there, Mara. \xc2\xa0We were all there. \xc2\xa0We saw what happened when this -- when there were demands made that we will not -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll let the United States of America default if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get this, this, and this. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the way to run the greatest economy in the world.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But what leverage does he have to force Congress to do that, to raise the --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about the influences on our lawmakers. \xc2\xa0And it would be not surprising to me if already the voices we have begun to be heard in the business community and elsewhere multiplied and multiplied, as well as the voices of ordinary Americans, if leaders in Congress actually seriously entertained doing that harm to our economy again at a political peak. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine they would want to do that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, Major.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell makes the following two points on the ones you just made. \xc2\xa0One, from the podium, there are times when you justifiably assert administration pride for the trillion dollars in spending cuts already achieved. \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell points out historically that was not the original White House position in the context of the debt ceiling debate of last year; that that was a forcing mechanism. \xc2\xa0And on the floor of the Senate, he said this morning -- and I quote him directly -- \xe2\x80\x9cLook, the only way we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever cut spending around here is by using the debate over the debt limit to do it. \xc2\xa0Now the President wants to remove that spur to cut altogether. \xc2\xa0I assure you it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen. \xc2\xa0The American people want us to fight to cut spending. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a fight they deserve. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have it.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I appreciate that history lesson. \xc2\xa0I would say that Republicans were in control of Congress for much of the time that President George W. Bush was in office, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do a great job of controlling spending. \xc2\xa0When President Clinton was here deficits were cut, surpluses were achieved. \xc2\xa0Now, that was work with Congress as well by both Democratic and Republican leaders.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, the President has, for a long time now, had on the table the only balanced and specific proposal to achieve $4 trillion in deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that from Republicans yet.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But a trillion of that you count came from the fight over the debt ceiling.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0So does Simpson-Bowles, so does every deficit reduction -- I mean, when we started talking about $4 trillion in deficit reduction, it was prior to the passage of a trillion dollars in discretionary spending cuts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that the -- Republicans make the point that the forcing mechanism, both politically and legislatively, was this debt limit debate.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0You were engaged --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And they, from their perspective, don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily consider it altogether as harmful as the administration does. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you to respond to that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the question is.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a valid argument to continue to use the debt ceiling as a forcing mechanism to achieve spending cuts?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would ask American businesses, I would ask American workers whether they think that what happened in the summer of 2011 when Republicans -- some with great enthusiasm -- threatened to have the United States default for the first time in its history was worth the price paid. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think they would say it was, and we can\'t do it again.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Syria, let me ask you one quick question. \xc2\xa0Secretary of Defense Panetta said just this morning that we -- meaning the United States government -- \xe2\x80\x9cremain very concerned, very concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d he said again, \xe2\x80\x9cthat as the opposition advances, in particular on Damascus, that the regime might very well consider the use of chemical weapons." \xc2\xa0This feels from a distance to be like something that is increasing in its urgency, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense perhaps that there\xe2\x80\x99s more intelligence than there was the last time you addressed this. \xc2\xa0Can you give us a sense of any heightened level of concern or closing window about whether these chemical weapons might be used? \xc2\xa0And do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and can you tell us anything about the sense the administration has about how it might be changing the minds in Moscow?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an issue that we discuss with the Russians and others; those who have influence over the Assad regime or communication with the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the President was very clear when he said that if the Assad regime makes the tragic mistake of using chemical weapons or fails to meet its obligation to secure them there will be consequences and the regime will be held accountable.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe international community -- this goes to your question about the Russians -- is united on this issue, and the message to the Assad regime about our red lines has been very clear. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific intelligence. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe continue to closely monitor Syria\xe2\x80\x99s proliferation-sensitive materials and facilities. \xc2\xa0And we remain focused on supporting the Syrian Opposition Council -- Coalition, rather, and working with like-minded countries to determine what more we can do to support a political transition that brings the conflict of Syria to an end -- in.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This doesn\'t feel or look to the administration any more urgent than it did, say, 48 hours ago?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear all week about our concern -- well, probably longer than that, but since this has been a heightened -- an issue that\'s getting heightened attention, we have made clear I think in very stark terms our concern about it. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize our assessments based on intelligence any more than that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, you said a moment ago it was frightening for the Republicans to bring back the debt ceiling again and raise the specter of the nation defaulting. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it frightening for the American people to hear the Treasury Secretary say we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to go off the cliff?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President of the United States will not sign a bill that extends tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires or for those making more than $250,000 a year. \xc2\xa0This is an issue that the American people understand, they are very clear about, and if public surveys are to be believed, are supportive of the President on. \xc2\xa0We can\'t afford it. \xc2\xa0He has made this very clear.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat he has also made clear is that Republicans in the House could act today to give tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people. \xc2\xa0They won\xe2\x80\x99t, or at least they have not because they insist that tax cuts for the top 2 percent are more important. \xc2\xa0If they didn\'t have that opinion, if they didn\'t have that position, 40 of them could change their minds, the bill could be brought up, it could pass the House and uncertainty for 98 percent of the American people would go away on this issue. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that willingness. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd again, the speciousness of the argument, that this is all about small businesses, has been debunked repeatedly. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not. \xc2\xa0And giving a tax cut for those who make under $250,000, as the President insists we do, would apply to 97 percent of small businesses in America, 98 percent of American earners. \xc2\xa0So we have to do it. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But when you draw a line in the sand and you say there can\'t be a deal without the tax situation being dealt with, you\'re about emphasizing -- and the President, in the comments to the Business Roundtable not emphasizing the spending cut side of this that the Republicans are pressing -- and to use your credit card analogy, when you say, well, if you\'re in credit card debt you\'ve got to pay your bills -- if you\'re $16 trillion in credit card debt, you also have to stop taking out more credit cards, right? \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- to Major\'s question, the Republicans are saying, unless they bring up this debt ceiling thing and have that out there, you\'re not going to cut spending; you\'re just going to keep -- the debt limit goes higher and you keep spending more money, you and Congress both.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well that\xe2\x80\x99s false. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s simply false. \xc2\xa0The President has put forward a very specific deficit reduction plan. And let\'s talk about cuts, okay? \xc2\xa0The President signed into law a trillion dollars in discretionary spending cuts. \xc2\xa0The President has a specific proposal to achieve $600 billion in savings from our entitlement programs, including our health care entitlement programs. \xc2\xa0And he has been constant and explicit in making the point that he understands that as part of a negotiation and as part of reaching a deal that he is going to have to make tough choices on spending, and he is absolutely willing to do that. \xc2\xa0He knows that he will have to do that. \xc2\xa0But it requires the Republicans to acknowledge the simple fact and to act on the simple fact that rates are going up for the wealthiest Americans.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIt is simply not acceptable to hold 98 percent of the country hostage in order to -- on the proposition that folks making more than $250,000 absolutely have to have another tax cut. \xc2\xa0We can\'t afford it. \xc2\xa0So when it comes to spending cuts, this President is deadly serious. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAgain, I want to go back to what I talked about before -- the purpose here is to achieve a $4 trillion package in deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0It\'s not only to create revenues for revenues\' sake; it is to -- the goal here is deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0One of the reasons why we can\'t extend tax cuts -- the principal reason why we can\'t extend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans is because we need to pay down our deficit. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYou saw what happened. \xc2\xa0You were here in 2001, 2003 -- tax cuts that were first -- I mean, I covered the campaign; in 2000, we had to enact a tax cut of more than a trillion dollars, said the man who then became President, because we had surpluses, and that money should go back to the American people. \xc2\xa0So that was one way of getting rid of our surpluses. \xc2\xa0Then we had to, as the economy began to slow down, we had to give a tax cut because it would help the economy grow. \xc2\xa0And then we did another one of over a trillion dollars. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd the result of that and other policies, of putting two wars on a credit card and some of the other policy decisions that were made is that we took a situation in January of 2001 where we had record surpluses, and just eight years later we had record deficits. \xc2\xa0When this President was sworn into office, he was handed a deficit of over a trillion dollars.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s not sound economic policy. \xc2\xa0We can\'t go down that road again. \xc2\xa0We need to, for the sake of getting our deficits under control and assisting our economy, take the kind of action the President has proposed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last question. \xc2\xa0When you were being asked about Hurricane Sandy and Governor Christie being here, et cetera -- and Governor Cuomo was around this week as well -- you have people in New York and New Jersey who are saying, I understand that the administration can\'t heal everyone overnight, but there are people in New York and New Jersey who are saying weeks later they still don\xe2\x80\x99t have electricity; people are having -- one guy had his house bulldozed -- his house was still standing, it got bulldozed because of confusion. \xc2\xa0People are still hurting. \xc2\xa0They\'re not -- they still don\xe2\x80\x99t have electricity, weeks later. \xc2\xa0So for all the talk in Washington, how is it that some people still have not been helped?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would point you to the substantial and vast effort that the President oversaw in terms of the federal response to this terrible storm. \xc2\xa0And I think that that effort by FEMA and other agencies -- by the Department of Defense and the unprecedented action that the military took to assist in this effort has been documented and talked about.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThere is no question, as the President saw when he was on Staten Island, that there is enormous suffering that continues, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are working closely with states and localities to continue the effort to assist in the recovery and ongoing activities to mitigate the damage done by the storm, the damage done to people\'s lives and to the economy in those states. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut there is no question that some of the issues that you mentioned in terms of power and what sounds like maybe a mistake in terms of how -- those are obviously local issues. \xc2\xa0But this President has been very aggressive in pressing the leaders of his administration to cut through red tape, to act swiftly and aggressively in assisting New Jersey and New York and affected areas of Connecticut in dealing with what was unquestionably one of the worst storms that this country has ever endured.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is he satisfied with the federal response in --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0He is focused on continued federal response, and he knows that our work is not done any more than the work in the states is done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0None of this stuff angers him?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think that the President is incredibly concerned about those who are still suffering the consequences of the storm. \xc2\xa0That\'s why he continues to have meetings on it regularly. \xc2\xa0That\'s why he continues to task his team to assist states and localities in the effort. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s focused on making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to assist.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMike.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What does the departure of Senator DeMint say about the relative ascendancy or descendancy of the tea party in American politics?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to you to analyze. \xc2\xa0I just saw that report.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a reaction from the White House?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any, no.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President pledge -- will the President stay in town through the course of these negotiations and not forgo any plans he might have to take a holiday vacation?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that Congress has a strong role to play here. \xc2\xa0What the issue is -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along while we are getting closer and closer to the end of the year how we achieve a deal here is not that complicated and we still believe we can make it happen. \xc2\xa0The President is focused very much on trying to make that happen. \xc2\xa0But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about what none of us hopes comes to pass, which is a lack of a deal. \xc2\xa0We believe that we can get one if Republicans acknowledge and act on a fundamental fact, which is that rates are going up on the wealthiest Americans.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The rates that you mentioned are 39.6 percent. \xc2\xa0You talk about the Clinton rates and how the country prospered under them. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask this one more time. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Sure.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know it\xe2\x80\x99s been asked a million different ways. \xc2\xa0Is 39.6 percent an essential benchmark? \xc2\xa0Or is there wiggle room --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Since you ask that way -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I got you pinned down there. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, you heard Jason Furman eloquently and elegantly go into detail about the issues that are problematic with proposals that purport to achieve significant revenues solely by closing loopholes and capping deductions. \xc2\xa0The math doesn\'t work -- in some cases, the math doesn\'t work and the middle class gets hammered, or the math works on paper but there\xe2\x80\x99s no way that Congress is going to, for example, eliminate the charitable deduction for the top 1 percent because that would have a terrible impact on churches and universities and institutions that depend on charity. \xc2\xa0I think, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, in citing one of the proposals from the think tank that we were discussing, Jason suggested that $10 billion in charitable deductions would be lost. \xc2\xa0So that\'s not likely to be passed by Congress by members of either party.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe way to do this is the way that the President has presented. \xc2\xa0You need both higher rates for the top 2 percent, tax cuts for the 98 percent, and proposals that close some loopholes and cap some deductions for those making over $250,000. \xc2\xa0The combination achieves the kind of target in revenue that is necessary to have the balance in the overall plan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a plan that does that besides the President\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0So far from the Republicans, we have a single sentence on revenue that says that $800 billion can be achieved through capping deductions and closing loopholes, but that\'s it. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no numbers. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no specificity. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President has said he wants to have -- he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to see and look at proposals, but they have to add up. \xc2\xa0They have to be politically feasible. \xc2\xa0And the way to do this -- it is far preferable, as Jason said, to allow rates to go up on the top 2 percent to the levels they were under Clinton when the top 2 percent did very well than to eliminate charitable deductions, or ask the middle class to have their taxes go up through the elimination or downsizing of the mortgage home interest deduction or health care deduction or state and local tax deduction.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThese are not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to throw out proposals and suggest they might work, but then people who put the numbers on paper can show you why there are problems with alternative proposals, which is why the President believes rates -- that his plan that allows those rates to go up, back to where they were under President Clinton is the right way to go.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the question is whether he is open for 37 or something over $250,000.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to speculate about proposals that do not exist. \xc2\xa0We have a plan that\'s very specific and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple. \xc2\xa0Republicans who haven\xe2\x80\x99t disowned the pledge they made to Grover Norquist don\'t have to vote for a tax hike or on rates. \xc2\xa0They simply have to vote for a tax cut for 98 percent of the American people and let existing law for the top 2 percent stay in place. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like such a terrible thing to do. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also absolutely the right thing to do as a matter of policy. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we encourage Republican leaders to hear the voices that are increasingly being heard from both their fellow lawmakers and others in the broader Republican community who acknowledge that this is the way the country needs to move. \xc2\xa0Congressman LaTourette said I think yesterday, \xe2\x80\x9cthe President has won this round relative to the rates, but we need you to sit down and get the second half of the deal, and that\'s the spending.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President could not agree more. \xc2\xa0He also said, \xe2\x80\x9cSome people in this 2 percent who call me, they\'re more worried about the fiscal cliff than about the rates going up a couple of points.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I think that\'s an excellent point. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the numerous members of Congress, members of the Senate, business leaders and others who understand that the consequences of the fiscal cliff, the consequences of raising taxes on everyone, an average of $2,200 for the average family, are quite serious. \xc2\xa0All we have to do here is extend those tax cuts to the middle class and allow the rates for the top 2 percent to go up, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about now for weeks and months and years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, going back to the storm recovery story, based on, as you put it, the President\xe2\x80\x99s incredible concern, can you characterize any sense or urgency in getting this package together? \xc2\xa0This has been in the works now for a number of weeks.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, like I said, we expect to have a request moved by the end of the week. \xc2\xa0We\'re hopeful. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0By the end of the week. \xc2\xa0And how long did the President meet with Governor Christie?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a number of minutes. \xc2\xa0It was a pre-meeting before Governor Christie met with Jack Lew, Jeff Zientz, Alyssa Mastromonaco and other senior staff. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a number -- a minute count for you since I wasn\'t --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was the conversation confined to the storm recovery?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you find out? \xc2\xa0I mean, there are a lot of people --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to give a readout --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m not asking for a readout --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That is a readout. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, it\'s not. \xc2\xa0I mean, there are a lot of people in that part of the world who are --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0You\'re asking for what they talked about -- that\xe2\x80\x99s, in normal parlance, unless I\'m mistaken, that\xe2\x80\x99s a readout.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m not asking for quotes. \xc2\xa0There are a lot of people up there who are very concerned about this. \xc2\xa0There\'s a great deal --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0As is the President. \xc2\xa0And I\'m sure -- again, I wasn\'t in the room. \xc2\xa0I mean, I saw Governor Christie and I saw the President, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t participate in their conversation so I can\'t tell you that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about other issues. \xc2\xa0But I\'m sure that they talked principally about this issue, which is of significance concerned to both men.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s all I asked.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, you asked if they talked about other issues.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, if they principally talked about this issue. \xc2\xa0I mean it\'s --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they did.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not like the fiscal cliff negotiations here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0This is just a matter of major interest to a lot of people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Well, they definitely talked about -- I am confident they discussed the subject that was the reason why Governor Christie was here, which is -- and to have the meeting with senior staff.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, can you confirm that Governor Pawlenty was also here today, or is here, and what he --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he\'s here?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I do not. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And secondly, can we quickly revisit the debt ceiling question? \xc2\xa0You were asked yesterday about whether the President would invoke executive power and the 14th Amendment. \xc2\xa0Can you say that --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0And Peter, with lightning speed, dug up a quote that I thought would take at least a few hours to find. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Let me --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you found another one? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say that the President has ruled that out as an option, or can you say whether there are discussions or studies underway?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Let me give you your answer. \xc2\xa0I can say that this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the President the power to ignore the debt ceiling -- period.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, two questions --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Sorry, let me get to --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is this the first time you all have said that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so, no. \xc2\xa0I think this is actually consistent with what we said last year. \xc2\xa0I think there was a period where this was under discussion and maybe the quote you found was before it had been looked at in that level of detail. \xc2\xa0But I believe when this was under discussion at the time, this is where we landed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there was no further study after that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I can just tell you what our position is.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you find that quote, Peter? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0After the briefing. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0How is Secretary Geithner saying the administration is absolutely willing to go off the fiscal cliff dissimilar from, during the debt ceiling negotiations, some Republicans saying, don\xe2\x80\x99t increase the debt ceiling, period?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, they\'re wholly different things. \xc2\xa0This is what is interesting, too, and I actually --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They both have major consequences.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0-- I do believe that there are people even in Washington who don\xe2\x80\x99t understand this, and, understandably, in the country who don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that we are actually talking about polar opposite issues. \xc2\xa0The fiscal cliff is not about deficits. \xc2\xa0It\'s about cutting spending and withdrawing money from the economy too quickly. \xc2\xa0And that impact would be negative on the economy because --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But what about the fact that both have major economic consequences?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, the President is clear that -- (cell phone rings) --(laughter.) \xc2\xa0That is humiliating for Hans. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0You guys have to -- somebody has to find out who that is. \xc2\xa0It\'s a specialized ring. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo where was I? \xc2\xa0What were we talking about? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They both have major economic consequences.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0They both have significant economic consequences. \xc2\xa0I think there is nothing quite like the significance of defaulting on our full faith and credit for the first time in history. \xc2\xa0We saw that even the threat of that had profoundly negative consequences in 2011.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this is a part -- so how are they not --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Let me continue. \xc2\xa0Just because I think a lot of people may not understand the distinction here. \xc2\xa0The fiscal cliff is a combination of tax hikes that would go into effect if Congress doesn\'t act and across-the-board spending cuts that would go into effect if Congress doesn\'t act and achieve spending cuts in a more refined way that would, economists say, have a negative impact on our economy. \xc2\xa0But it would be basically too much deficit reduction too quickly. \xc2\xa0And that\'s --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But both could send the economy into -- would send the economy into recession.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I promise I will answer your question. \xc2\xa0But I think -- I bet there are -- I\'m certain there are people who are watching who don\'t understand. \xc2\xa0I saw a proposal by a governor today that seemed to confuse the issue that the fiscal cliff actually had to do with the problem of high deficits. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite. \xc2\xa0It is action -- the absence of action here would result in significant tax hikes and across-the-board spending cuts that would have a negative impact on the economy because of the immediacy and the effect of them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m talking --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Okay, so what Secretary Geithner was saying, as the President has said and as I have said and others, is that the President will not accept a bad deal. \xc2\xa0He will not sign into law an extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. \xc2\xa0We can\'t afford it. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy. \xc2\xa0Republicans know that. \xc2\xa0This is not news. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been having this debate for years. \xc2\xa0It was the number-one focus of debate in a presidential election that just ended. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo again, I read you a series of -- well, I could read many more that you know about and I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve reported on a series of acknowledgements by Republicans, members of Congress and others, who acknowledge that the wealthiest are going to have to provide revenue in order to achieve -- avert the fiscal cliff and to achieve sustained -- deficit reduction of the size that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about. \xc2\xa0Rates are going to have to go up, as the President said. \xc2\xa0This is simply a matter of Secretary Geithner repeating what the President said. \xc2\xa0There is no deal without rates going up.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I remember you standing there and saying that Republicans were playing chicken with the credit of the United States. \xc2\xa0How is this not playing chicken with the health of the U.S. economy?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s the choice that Republicans have to make: \xc2\xa0Give tax cuts to 98 percent of the people, or have taxes go up on everybody. \xc2\xa0That doesn\'t seem like the worst choice in the world, right? \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s extend tax cuts to the vast majority of the American people, and not refuse to give those tax cuts to the people because you insist that millionaires and billionaires and those making over $250,000 a year have to get another tax cut, too. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s nonsensical.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- members of Congress don\'t even have to vote when it comes to rates for a tax hike. \xc2\xa0They simply have to vote for a tax cut, and let the law, as it\xe2\x80\x99s written, stay in place.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just lastly, Senate Minority Leader McConnell tried to get a vote yesterday on the Senate floor on the President\xe2\x80\x99s deficit reduction proposal, and Senate Majority Leader Reid objected. \xc2\xa0Do you think you -- how much Democratic support do you feel you have for it in the Senate?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, I understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of -- this is the kind of political games that aren\xe2\x80\x99t serious. \xc2\xa0It is absolutely the case that we need to have a serious proposal -- I mean a serious negotiation about serious issues, spending cuts and the like that will require a compromise. \xc2\xa0The fact that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why is it a game to put the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan on the floor?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, do you think you have Democratic support?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We know that the filibuster is --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why propose something you don\'t have --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0-- is certainly an issue here, that we don\'t have 60 votes in the Senate. \xc2\xa0So I would not argue with the --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But do you have Democratic votes?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0-- idea that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal cannot at this time, or has not at this time garnered Republican support. \xc2\xa0That\'s what this debate is about. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- garnered Democratic support?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We are very confident that Democrats support the principle that we need to have $1.6 trillion in revenue, asking the wealthy to pay more as part of a balanced package that the President has put forward --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, why not have a vote to show the Republicans don\'t want to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re going along with the gamesmanship here. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be serious about these negotiations. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to -- we have put forward a proposal. We have seen no substantive counter-proposal, especially on revenues from Republicans.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, if that\'s gamesmanship, then how is the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal not gamesmanship?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0He didn\'t say, here\xe2\x80\x99s my proposal; take it or leave it. \xc2\xa0He has been very explicit in saying we need to negotiate --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t counter-offered with something else that might garner more --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he should put forward a proposal, and then, absent a proposal from the Republicans, put forward another proposal? \xc2\xa0And then, absent a proposal from the Republicans --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They put forward a proposal.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s one sentence on revenue that has no meaning or substance behind it. \xc2\xa0That\'s not serious. \xc2\xa0And it doesn\'t meet the level of specificity or even come close to the level of specificity the President has put forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe have to have -- we can\'t have a vague promise of revenue in the future from the wealthy, and then concrete spending cuts that affect middle-class families, that affect seniors, that affect programs that are vital to a lot of Americans now, and say -- because the result is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen again and again and again: \xc2\xa0The middle class gets hit with the bill. \xc2\xa0Seniors bear the burden. \xc2\xa0That\'s not the way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do this. \xc2\xa0That\'s not the way the American people want us to do it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tOlivier.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple on Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0One, as you have the negotiations about a post-2014 possible presence, is immunity from prosecution something that this administration regards as a must-have?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a discussion specifically on that lately.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0President Karzai today said that Afghanistan is more corrupt than ever before and says the United States and its allies are chiefly to blame. \xc2\xa0Do you agree?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I would simply say that the issue of corruption is one of concern and has been in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0We share President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s concern about that and we work with the government of Afghanistan on this issue regularly. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not \xc2\xa0-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- to make the comparison of where it is now compared to where it was -- we know it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem and has been a problem, and we continue to work with the government on that problem.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Jay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Last one.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just -- on a foreign policy question on China. \xc2\xa0Did the President have the opportunity to sign the letter by Nobel Laureates, which included some Peace Prize Laureates, to Xi Jinping calling for the release of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you take that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And get back to us?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tPeter.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry, two very quick questions. \xc2\xa0You said the administration does not believe the President can ignore the debt ceiling. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to parse, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to play any definitional games, like some people say he can lift the debt ceiling on his own. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not saying there\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction here you\xe2\x80\x99re making?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not. \xc2\xa0I think -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the language that I have. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear. \xc2\xa0We believe profoundly that Congress ought to simply do its job in a routine fashion, that we can and should engage in negotiations and discussions about how to reduce our deficits in a substantial and sustainable way that helps our economy and helps it create jobs.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re not under-reading the word \xe2\x80\x9cignore\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to later you guys come and say, we\xe2\x80\x99re not ignoring it; we\xe2\x80\x99re raising it ourselves.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I would just point to the language.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then Russia -- the Senate may pass today the bill repealing Jackson-Vanik in terms of Russia, and adding Magnitsky human rights sanctions. \xc2\xa0Are you all going to sign it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, we look forward to Congress acting on this. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working for it and the President does hope to be able to sign it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThanks very much.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t12:50 P.M.
