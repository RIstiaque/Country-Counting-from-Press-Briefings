EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Florida.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top.\xc2\xa0 But Jen does, so I\'ll turn it over to Jen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So a couple things we just wanted to highlight\xc2\xa0 -- one, as you all saw in your inboxes, we have a new ad out called, "Stretch," that\'s running in eight states.\xc2\xa0 It highlights the devastating impact Mitt Romney\'s tax plan would have on middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 The President will talk about that again today in Florida and Virginia, as he did yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also put out a new video, starring Internet sensation, Stephanie Cutter, that includes -- in the link to the video you\'ll see a tax cut calculator.\xc2\xa0 Anyone can go there -- any American can go there, enter their information, and they\'ll see how the tax cut plans of President Obama and Mitt Romney line up. If you\'re a millionaire or billionaire, it\'s probably not looking good for you in our plan, but otherwise, you\'re great under our plan.\xc2\xa0 So we encourage people to go there.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast thing to highlight is we put out state-by-state reports today, as well, highlighting the impact of the tax plan.\xc2\xa0 Since we\'re going to Florida and Virginia today, I just wanted to highlight for you that in Florida, there are 2.4 million families making less than $200,000 a year, who would be impacted by Mitt Romney\'s tax plan, in the Tax Policy Center report that went out yesterday.\xc2\xa0 In Virginia, that\'s 1.2 million.\xc2\xa0 Again, that would be an increase of -- a $2,000 tax increase for those families.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast thing -- a big announcement day, sorry -- is Mitt Romney, as you know, is traveling to Colorado today.\xc2\xa0 If you\'ve spent any time reading the papers in Iowa and some other Midwestern states, you may have seen a focus on this wind tax credit, which is something that has been debated in Congress. Welcoming Mitt Romney there is a story in The Denver Post about how three out of four Republicans in the delegation are for the tax credit; he is, of course, against it.\xc2\xa0 And it also talks about a local company called Bestas Vestas that will stand to lose 1,700 jobs.\xc2\xa0 So I thought I\'d highlight that for you, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut with that, we\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, today Kofi Annan quit his role in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction from the President?\xc2\xa0 And you seemed concerned that this might further sideline any peace efforts in that region.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, the President is grateful for Kofi Annan\'s willingness to serve in this capacity and for the efforts he made to achieve peace in Syria and a peaceful transition from the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that Kofi Annan\'s resignation highlights two things -- one, the fact that President Assad, despite his promise to abide by Kofi Annan\'s plan, continues to brutally murder his own people, to use heavy weapons in assaults on civilian population centers, to call on his military leaders to kill the Syrian people in his name.\xc2\xa0 It is disgusting and only highlights the absolute requirement that, for the future of the Syrian people, Assad must step aside.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, Annan\'s resignation highlights the failure at the United Nations Security Council of Russia and China to support resolutions -- meaningful resolutions against Assad that would have held Assad accountable for his failure to abide by his commitments under the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 Those vetoes, as we\'ve said repeatedly, were highly regrettable, and place both Russia and China on the wrong side of history and on the wrong side of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 Very unfortunate.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe continue to work with our international partners, including the "Friends of Syria," to provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 In fact, today I have for you -- I think we put this out already, but as you know, the President approved an additional $12 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance to support those most affected by the crisis in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That brings the commitment so far from the United States to over $76 million in humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, as you know, we continue to work with our partners in assisting the opposition form itself and unify, and to provide non-lethal assistance to the opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- consider arming rebels?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position has not changed.\xc2\xa0 We provide non-lethal assistance to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t believe that adding to the number of weapons in Syria is what\'s needed to help bring about a peaceful transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, given reports that the opposition is, in some cases, executing prisoners, is there concern about providing assistance to people who may turn out to be war criminals?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we strongly condemn summary executions by either side in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And I have obviously seen those reports and we condemn actions like that.\xc2\xa0 As I just said, the reason why we -- our position is that we will not supply lethal assistance to the opposition is we do not believe that adding more weapons into Syria will help bring about the peaceful transition that Syria needs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe strongly that once Assad leaves, Syria\'s opportunity for a peaceful transition can move forward, that the key element here is Assad\'s departure from power.\xc2\xa0 It is important to note that it is the Assad regime and Assad\'s forces that have perpetrated the overwhelming amount of violence in Syria, that are responsible for the overwhelming number of civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we so strongly, and have for so long, believed that Assad must go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what\'s the administration\'s view of the cohesiveness of the rebel force?\xc2\xa0 Are they acting in unison?\xc2\xa0 Is there a leadership group within it?\xc2\xa0 Are they so disparate that it makes it difficult for the administration to determine who they can count on there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have spent, as I\'ve said in the past, time studying the opposition, working with the opposition.\xc2\xa0 I would note that there has been progress by the opposition in unifying itself.\xc2\xa0 I would note that some leaders of the opposition, military leaders, have made clear their position that they are fighting for a Syria that is inclusive, that recognizes the rights of all Syrians.\xc2\xa0 And we would certainly support that position.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we believe the Syrian people deserve and that\'s what we believe those peaceful demonstrators who first came out against Assad were demanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there was also a report in Reuters, confirmed by NBC, that the President had signed a finding.\xc2\xa0 The White House has not commented on that.\xc2\xa0 But in the past you\'ve shot down some of those reports; in this case, you\'re not.\xc2\xa0 Should we read anything into that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that we\'ve commented one way or the other on intelligence matters.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t do that.\xc2\xa0 And I would not have any comment on that report.\xc2\xa0 I would point to you -- point out what I just said in answer to another question, that our position has not changed when it comes to the kinds of support that we provide and assistance that we provide to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress is going to release a report, maybe later this week, about more on the Solyndra affair -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw a report today about that, reporting that I think some White House analyst thought it not wise to move forward with the restructuring but rather cut your losses earlier, and that Jack Lew, when he was head of the Office of Management and Budget, despite some of that advice from internal White House advisors, decided to go ahead and go forward with it.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did see these reports, and what it points out is, yet again, proof positive that none of the accusations that the Republicans have made about this particular loan have turned out to be true -- that this was a merit-based decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President firmly believes that it is the right decision to invest in clean energy technologies in this country, because if we do not, we will cede those industries to China and India and Europe and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 The President is not willing to do that -- because those industries will be essential to the economic growth of the United States in the 21st century and to the energy security of the United States in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think some Republicans have conceded, have acknowledged that the Solyndra investigation is about politics.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now gone on for 18 months, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken -- 18 months.\xc2\xa0 Congress began looking at this loan in February of 2010, and everything disclosed in the 215,000 pages of documents, the 14 committee staff briefings, the 5 congressional hearings, the 72,000 pages from Solyndra investors, and committee interviews with George Kaiser affirm what we have said since day one, that this was a merit-based decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regards to the comment about the Office of Management and Budget, I mean, as you know, because your paper covered it, as did all papers -- this was all explored both in newspapers and in a congressional hearing nine months ago.\xc2\xa0 At the time, then-OMB Deputy Director Jeff Zients said in his testimony the OMB\xe2\x80\x99s career staff worked closely with the Department of Energy to understand the specifics of the proposal before making a cost determination, and ultimately determined that DOE\xe2\x80\x99s approach was reasonable and reflected the information as it was understood at the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I can point you to, and will gladly read for the record, 18 independent news sources, including the Wall Street Journal, Politifact, The Washington Post, San Jose Mercury News, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Hill, et cetera, et cetera -- concluded that, to quote this, "The emails do not offer evidence that would support Republican allegations that politics influenced the Department of Energy\xe2\x80\x99s decision."\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a quote from the Wall Street Journal in November of 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we knew then we still know, and this is a 18-month, costly investigation that only highlights the fact that Congress is not doing what it should do to help the American people.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it extending the production tax credit that Jen was talking about that has bipartisan support, has had it in the past and has it right now, that would help clean energy firms in Colorado and Iowa and elsewhere?\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the House passing tax relief for middle-class Americans, for 98 percent of the population?\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it passing legislation that was submitted by the President in the American Jobs Act that would put over a million Americans to work teaching our children, building our roads and protecting our people?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the choice they\xe2\x80\x99re making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A report today showed that initial jobless claims rose less than anticipated today.\xc2\xa0 Does that provide any sense of optimism looking ahead to tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s jobs report?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no observation to make in anticipation of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s data release.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that what I can be confident of is that we -- and the President believes that we absolutely need to continue to work to help the economy grow faster, to help it create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that will be as true tomorrow as it is today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have, as you know, experienced two years of positive economic growth -- more than that.\xc2\xa0 We have experienced 4.4 million private sector jobs created, but we still have a long way to go.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what I was just saying to Dave -- Congress must act to pass the American Jobs Act provisions that have not passed that would put teachers back to work, construction workers on the job, firefighters and police officers back to work, and pass this tax cut that the Senate passed that represents what we all agree on in Washington, that 98 percent of Americans ought to have their tax cut extended next year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat would create economic security for them.\xc2\xa0 It would prevent a $2,200 tax hike on middle-class families, and it would address some of the concerns about the economy at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 It would help the macroeconomic picture for 2013.\xc2\xa0 And Congress could do that simply by acknowledging that Republicans and Democrats all agree on this, and that we should act on that and then debate the things that we disagree on as we move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect to hear from the President tomorrow after the numbers come out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I would expect you will.\xc2\xa0 As he normally does, he will address that bit of news.\xc2\xa0 But I have no more for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- had a story today about a near miss, potential accident at Reagan National Airport.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House has been briefed on what happened by the FAA, and also what concerns you might have about it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly saw the reports, and I know that people in the White House are aware of it, but I do not have anything more for you on it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s under investigation by the FAA and I would refer you to the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jen, can you preview the President\'s comments to the blogger conference --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you repeat the question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Ari asked about the blogger conference.\xc2\xa0 The President is speaking -- will be appearing live over satellite to their 2012 conference today from our first stop in Florida.\xc2\xa0 This is a group of women bloggers.\xc2\xa0 They reach millions of people across the country.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, people get their news from many different sources -- NPR, AP, Reuters, Washington Post -- but they also get it from blogs and online, increasingly.\xc2\xa0 And this is a group the President has addressed in the past, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for him to speak about his commitment to not just fighting for middle-class tax cuts, but fighting for affordable health care, making sure that women have a voice in the White House.\xc2\xa0 And I expect when you hear his remarks today that\'s what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Senator Lindsey Graham suggested that the fiscal cliff, the sequester and the cuts that it envisions could be resolved if the President would just call John McCain and have a discussion as to how to emerge out of this.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree that a mere phone call can get this issue resolved with somebody like McCain?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly think the President believes that if Republican leaders were to tell him that they were ready to support the basic principle that we need to address our fiscal challenges in a balanced way, that we can move forward with a plan for deficit reduction that doesn\'t just cut spending, doesn\'t just reform entitlements, but also asks everyone to pay their fair share -- then, absolutely, we could get this done very quickly, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly and as the President has said repeatedly.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, what I have seen from the Senators you mentioned is that they\'re calling for action to prevent cuts that the President does not support -- that no one supports -- to take action on that not by advancing a balanced deficit reduction plan.\xc2\xa0 And the reason they won\xe2\x80\x99t do that, or haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet, is because they would rather see those defense cuts take place than ask millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 And that is simply indefensible as a proposition.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to why the so-called sequester exists -- because of the refusal of Republicans to accept the principle that we ought to have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, and because of their willingness to play chicken with the global and American economies.\xc2\xa0 The President and the congressional negotiators agreed to the Budget Control Act, which enacted significant deficit reduction, spending cuts, and called on Congress -- assigned to Congress the task of delivering additional deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 If Congress failed to do its job, the sequester was to kick in.\xc2\xa0 And the design of the sequester was onerous for everyone.\xc2\xa0 No one supports the cuts, and that\'s why no amount of planning can paper over the fact that the cuts are bad policy.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\'t support them.\xc2\xa0 But the problem here is, is that Congress refuses to do its job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I just said at the top, what they need to do is abundantly clear to anyone who has paid attention to this issue, studied this issue, and that is agree to the simple principle that we have to address our fiscal challenges by implementing a balanced plan -- because if we don\'t, we know what the alternative looks like.\xc2\xa0 The alternative says millionaires and billionaires get tax cuts, the middle class gets stuck with the bill of solving our fiscal challenges; that seniors see their Medicare program ended as they know it and turned into a voucher program; that families who have disabled children see their benefits cut dramatically; that programs in education and innovation and investments in infrastructure all get dramatically slashed.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe cannot do that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And we do not have to do that.\xc2\xa0 All we have to do is pass legislation that is balanced, that reflects the principles of the Bowles-Simpson commission, reflects the principles of the Domenici-Rivlin commission, reflects the principles of the Gang of Six -- reflects the principles of every common-sense person who has looked at this issue -- every economist, every legislative analyst who has looked at this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is about to go speak in Florida, a state hard hit by housing boom and bust.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction from the President on Edward DeMarco\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to do the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan to implement a principal write-down program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Treasury Secretary Geithner addressed this,\xc2\xa0 And look, we certainly believe that we need to take measures that assist homeowners who are underwater.\xc2\xa0 And the President has implemented a number of measures that have done that.\xc2\xa0 The President is calling on Congress to take measures that would assist homeowners and allow them to refinance at these historically low rates.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly believe that the action that Mr. DeMarco, after six months of study, refused to take should have been taken -- could be taken to further assist homeowners.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any plans to replace him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any plans to replace him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this is a career position.\xc2\xa0 This is not \xe2\x80\x93 [it\xe2\x80\x99s] an independent agency, one.\xc2\xa0 Two, the President nominated a highly qualified person, and because of the kind of classic obstructionism we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Congress, that nomination did not move forward.\xc2\xa0 But I have no other personnel announcements to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Jen had something on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add one thing since you referenced our trip to Florida.\xc2\xa0 While the President has taken a number of steps to help hardest-hit states like Florida help recover during the housing market -- as the housing market has struggled, let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that Mitt Romney has suggested we should just let the housing market hit bottom.\xc2\xa0 So even though we\xe2\x80\x99re going there today, we know he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go there soon, and this is an issue that, no question, gives people in states like Florida and Nevada and the hardest-hit states pause when they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the choice.</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there were 19 House Democrats that voted with House Republicans yesterday to pass all the Bush tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Is the President prepared to criticize those Democrats as he has Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support that position.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we cannot afford to extend tax cuts to the wealthiest 2 percent of the American people at the cost of over a trillion dollars over 10 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not just an esoteric position the President is taking.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s based on what we know happened when those tax cuts were passed.\xc2\xa0 When the Bush tax cuts were passed, we, the American people, were told that they would cause a huge increase in economic growth, a huge increase in job creation.\xc2\xa0 Neither happened.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we saw the slowest economic growth of any expansion in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 We saw anemic job creation.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, we saw the worst economic and financial crisis in any of our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 That was the legacy of those policies of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOh, and I forgot, record deficits.\xc2\xa0 President Bush came into office in January of 2001 with the largest surpluses in history, delivered to him by President Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 When he left office and President Obama took the oath in January of 2009, in addition to a cascading global economic calamity and a situation where we were losing jobs at the rate of 750,000 a month, President Obama was given the largest deficit in American history -- over a trillion dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we know what that approach results in.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s approach is quite different.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we can debate, and we should debate, and the President will debate, no doubt, during this campaign, whether or not now is the right time to give tax cuts to the richest and wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 But where there is no debate is that middle-class Americans, 98 percent of taxpaying Americans, ought to have their tax cuts extended.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the only obstacle to ensuring that 98 percent of the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes rise on January 1st is the obstinate refusal of Republicans to let go of the idea that millionaires and billionaires need a tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it just Republicans?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a significant number of Democrats as well --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying the position of the President could not have been clearer.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, a very small fraction of Democrats may have voted here, but the overwhelming majority of Democrats support the principle that the overwhelming, in fact, the entire majority -- the entire Republican caucus, I assume, in both the House and the Senate supports, which is that we ought to extend tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s do that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not hold middle-class tax cuts hostage to the idea that folks making over $250,000 need a tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any Olympic calls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Any other who?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Olympic calls.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 None today to report.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he watching onboard?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was in his office when I came down here, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching the women\xe2\x80\x99s all-around, and Ryan Lochte\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to go for a twofer gold, so -- we, being us.\xc2\xa0 And encouragement of others on the plane.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 The Olympics is definitely on on all the TV sets that I saw walking through the cabin.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:05 P.M.
