Brady Press Briefing Room</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t12:50 P.M. EDT</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Thank you all for being here. \xc2\xa0Before I start, I have two very important announcements to make. \xc2\xa0The first, contradicting the April Fool\xe2\x80\x99s joke that Jon-Christopher made yesterday, the Red Sox walloped the Yankees on opening day -- that\xe2\x80\x99s important to note -- 8-2. \xc2\xa0And second, the Nationals blanked the Marlins 2-0 with two homeruns by Bryce Harper in his first two at bats. \xc2\xa0Excellent opening day. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSecond announcement is Monday travel. \xc2\xa0You probably have seen, but I want to reiterate that on Monday, April 8th, President Obama will travel to the University of Hartford, where he will continue asking the American people to join him in calling on Congress to pass common-sense legislation to reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0Additional details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s event at the University of Hartford will be forthcoming.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions. \xc2\xa0Jim.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0I wanted to start with North Korea. \xc2\xa0Yesterday you said that the U.S. has seen no large-scale mobilizations or reposition of forces in North Korea. \xc2\xa0Today, Pyongyang said it will restart its plutonium reactor and increase production of nuclear weapons material. \xc2\xa0And I wondered if -- does that give the President some pause? \xc2\xa0And are you reconsidering the view that this is a familiar pattern or simply belligerent rhetoric? \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I appreciate the question. \xc2\xa0The fact is that North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that it will reopen or restart its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon is another indication of its pattern of contradicting its own commitments and its pattern of violating its international obligations. \xc2\xa0As you know, that facility has been dormant, as part of an agreement which North Korea, at least with this announcement, seems to be willing to violate.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd there is a path open to North Korea to achieve the security, international respect, and economic development that it seeks. \xc2\xa0But this is surely not the path. \xc2\xa0And as I said yesterday, it is our position and the position of a broad international alliance, if you will, that North Korea must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons and abide by all of its international commitments.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe seek the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization through authentic and credible negotiations. \xc2\xa0The U.S. and our international partners have a shared goal of ensuring the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and a strong, common interest in peace and stability in Southeast Asia. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs I said yesterday, we are working very closely with our allies in the region. \xc2\xa0We are taking appropriate measures in response to the bellicose rhetoric and provocative actions out of North Korea. \xc2\xa0But it is -- these actions and this rhetoric is in keeping with a pattern of behavior by the regime in Pyongyang.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, at the U.N. today, Ban Ki-moon seemed a little more alarmed, saying the current crisis has gone too far. \xc2\xa0He said North Korea is \xe2\x80\x9con a collision course with the international community\xe2\x80\x9d and that international negotiations are urgently needed. \xc2\xa0Does the President agree?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President has expressed his concern about the actions and behavior of the regime in North Korea. \xc2\xa0And we have worked with our allies, most recognizably at the United Nations Security Council, when a resolution was passed unanimously, with China and Russia, condemning North Korean behavior in this arena. \xc2\xa0And we will continue to do that. \xc2\xa0And the steps we take, together with our partners, put more pressure on North Korea, further isolate North Korea; make it clear to the regime there that there is no benefit to the North Korean people to the path that they are taking.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMeanwhile, we obviously take the steps necessary to ensure the capacity to assist our allies and defend the United States.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the trip to Hartford, coming after the trip to Denver tomorrow, is this a recognition by the President that he faces some real obstacles in Congress on anti-gun legislation or gun violence legislation -- even on the background checks that seemed to have some movement before?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President has always said, we have always said that this would be hard. \xc2\xa0If that weren\xe2\x80\x99t the case, it would have been done before. \xc2\xa0If it were simple to pass measures through Congress that are very common sense but would reduce gun violence in America, those measures would have passed already. \xc2\xa0And the President has always recognized that this is something that would be a challenge, but that in the wake of the horrific shootings at Newtown, was an obligation of all of us to work on and to try to get done. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe remain engaged in conversations with the Senate and those senators who are interested in forging a bipartisan compromise on measures to reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0I noted, and the President has noted, that when it comes to background checks -- the measure you mentioned -- this is something that\'s supported by over 90 percent of the American people. \xc2\xa0When you ask an average American whether or not it makes sense to have -- to require a background check if you\'re going to purchase a weapon, overwhelmingly, 90 percent-plus, they say of course it makes sense. \xc2\xa0And most of them say -- or many of them say they just assume that system already exists. \xc2\xa0And that\'s an important point to make, too, here, is that the system does exist. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe goal of those, like the President, who are trying to improve the system, is to close loopholes within it that make it imperfect; that allow those who should not obtain weapons to obtain them. \xc2\xa0And this is something we\'re working on very closely with members of both parties. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why the President is going to Denver. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the President is going to Hartford. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the Vice President has held so many events and meetings and conversations. \xc2\xa0And you can assume safely that lots of conversations take place between the administration and both staff and lawmakers on Capitol Hill on this issue, and we\'re going to continue to press forward. \xc2\xa0It\'s very important. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIt\'s essential to the memory of the victims of Newtown that all of these measures get a vote, that they are not filibustered, and it is essential that action be taken, as the President said so passionately last week.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, back on North Korea. \xc2\xa0When you say "working with our allies," what exactly does that mean?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, we are in close contact -- have been and continue to be -- with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo to coordinate on this issue, and we are regularly reaching out to Beijing and Moscow to encourage them to do more to restrain the North Koreans. \xc2\xa0And as I noted moments ago, that we have seen cooperation from all the members of the Security Council, as well as obviously our allies in the region, on this issue, and that is very helpful when it comes to putting the necessary pressure on North Korea.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThis is part of a pattern of behavior that we\'ve seen out of North Korea. \xc2\xa0North Korea acquired a nuclear weapon and tested it under the previous administration, and we have seen consistent behavior that is counterproductive, to say the least, to a goal that one assumes North Korea\'s leaders aspire to, which is an improvement of the lot of the North Korean people and an end to the isolation of their country within the international community. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President is being regularly updated on this and briefed on this. \xc2\xa0The entire national security team is obviously focused on this, as you would expect. \xc2\xa0But I think it\'s important to note that, as I said yesterday, the rhetoric has not been backed up by action, and there is a pattern here, a pattern that is familiar.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What are the Chinese and Russians not doing that they should be that would be more helpful?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\'s not a mystery to anyone that China has influence on North Korea, or potentially has influence on North Korea, and we have in the past, and we are now, urged China to use that influence to try to affect North Korean behavior. \xc2\xa0That is also true of our interactions with the Russians. \xc2\xa0This is a broad diplomatic effort that includes coordination with our allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea as well as with China and Russia and others. \xc2\xa0So we\'re going to keep up that effort.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And are you sort of waiting for this whole crisis atmosphere to blow over and then engage the North Koreans to try to get them back to the negotiating table?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think North Korea understands fully what steps it needs to take to move down the path towards ending its isolation, and those steps have to be concrete towards abiding by its international obligations. \xc2\xa0And there\'s a system in place for that to move forward. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMeanwhile, during a period like this where we\'re seeing this kind of pattern of behavior reassert itself, we\'re consulting with our allies, taking necessary precautions, making clear to the North Koreans what our views are, what the consensus view is of the international community; what steps they need to take to improve their situation within the world. \xc2\xa0And that process will continue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tDan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Just to follow on Jim\'s question -- does the President concede that the kind of bipartisan enthusiasm that existed after the Sandy Hook shootings is no longer there?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would point you to what the President said last Thursday. \xc2\xa0And he took great issue with the suggestion or the implication that a mere 100 days after that terrible event, somehow the country or Washington could move on. \xc2\xa0The families that suffered the loss in Newtown will never fully be able to move on. \xc2\xa0And those of us across the country who were horrified -- and as I think everyone in the country was -- by what happened in Newtown will never forget that day or the days after. \xc2\xa0And it\'s a reminder constantly of why we need to act.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs the President said way back in the wake of Newtown, if we can take some common-sense measures that would save one life, one child\'s life, we ought to do it. \xc2\xa0And if we can do more than that through the proposals that he has urged Congress to act on and the initiatives that he has acted on and is acting on administratively -- if we can reduce the amount of gun violence, if we can protect our children better -- then we will have at least partly fulfilled our most fundamental obligation. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd he believes that that passion, that urgency still exists around the country and still exists -- if not in full, then in part -- in Washington. \xc2\xa0And that is why he is continuing to make the case and why he will make the case in Denver and will make the case in Connecticut. \xc2\xa0It is why we are engaging with Congress on this very important matter.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I would just note that this process continues to move forward. \xc2\xa0Negotiations and conversations continue to take place. \xc2\xa0And it is essential that Congress act and essential that it take action.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would the President, though, be as aggressively pursuing this on the road -- and the Vice President and others in the administration -- if the conversation up on the Hill was in a better place?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think that sort of turns on its head the basic point, which is the President in the wake of Newtown made clear that the country needed to act and that he would act. \xc2\xa0He immediately called on Congress to take up measures that he supported, in terms of legislation that would help reduce gun violence, common-sense legislation that in no way infringes upon Americans\' Second Amendment rights. \xc2\xa0He then asked the Vice President to lead an effort to assess what else we could do, what package of initiatives we could act on to address this problem. \xc2\xa0And that, within a month, was put forward to the American people, and we have been pressing ever since. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut from the beginning, as everyone here knows, the proposition itself was a challenging one for all the reasons that we understand about the efforts in the past to address gun violence through common-sense legislation or other means. \xc2\xa0This is not easy stuff. \xc2\xa0And the President has been clear about that from the beginning. \xc2\xa0But that is not an excuse not to do everything you can to make it happen.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another subject, former-Secretary of State Clinton will be stepping out to make a public speech this evening. \xc2\xa0And I\'m wondering if the President is paying any attention to this at all. \xc2\xa0And does he continue to get any foreign policy advice from her?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I have no private conversations to read out to you with Secretary Clinton or anyone else. \xc2\xa0But you know how the President feels about Secretary Clinton, about her remarkable service in this administration in his first term. \xc2\xa0And I am sure -- I think you\'re referring to the Vital Voices event, and I\'m sure he wishes her well tonight and going forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, does the President think he can change votes in Congress by going out into the country and making this appeal on guns?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Jon, I don\'t think it\'s an issue of changing votes. \xc2\xa0It\'s a matter of what we\'ve always said, which is that these are -- all of these issues that we are addressing here in Washington have a direct impact on the lives of average Americans, and they have a stake in what we do here. \xc2\xa0And it has never been the President\'s belief that Americans elect their representatives, send them to Washington, and then disengage from the process. \xc2\xa0In fact, it\'s been the President\'s belief that Americans remain focused on a care deeply about what happens here, and that they want to be brought into and engaged in the process. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has taken the approach on this issue and so many other issues that he has --because he believes that the voices of the American people are a very important part of moving forward on these tough issues, whether it\'s budget or fiscal issues, or immigration reform, or measures to reduce gun violence.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I think that it\'s important -- it\'s an important part of the process that those of us who are here in Washington working on these issues are constantly reminded of the Americans out there in the country who care about what happens here and hold us accountable, and hold especially their elected leaders accountable for what they do and how they vote, and how they respond to national tragedies like the tragedy that occurred in Newtown, Connecticut.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s part of a process that he\'s engaged in. \xc2\xa0It\'s not an either/or, as we\'ve always said. \xc2\xa0As you know, and we\'ve been very transparent about, he is engaged very deeply in an effort on this issue and others to have constructive conversations with lawmakers of both parties. \xc2\xa0That process continues, and that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected even when Congress is out of town with our engagement at the staff level with staffs of both parties on Capitol Hill on this issue and others. \xc2\xa0And that will continue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut at no point in this process does the President believe we should leave the American people out of it. \xc2\xa0He will constantly engage them, and constantly make his views known and ask the American people to make their views known, because that\'s how stuff gets done, important stuff gets done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President obviously said this in the State of the Union, you just said it again -- it\'s essential that there be a vote on these issues. \xc2\xa0What are you demanding and what\'s the President demanding? \xc2\xa0A vote? \xc2\xa0Or to get these things passed?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, he clearly -- every element of the package that he put forward he supports 100 percent. \xc2\xa0It is a starting point to insist that they all get a vote, the legislative pieces of this. \xc2\xa0Because it would be appalling, in his view, if the memories of the victims of Newtown and other places were forgotten through the process of filibustering a vote on measures that the American people expect, whether they agree or disagree, their elected officials in Washington to vote on. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s all.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI mean, these are all tough issues. \xc2\xa0We\'ve talked about it with every component of the legislative package. \xc2\xa0But at the very least, we need votes on these. \xc2\xa0Those who are elected and sent to Washington need to cast a vote and say -- explain their position and say where they stand. \xc2\xa0The President is out there making an impassioned case for these common-sense measures. \xc2\xa0The Vice President is out there doing the same. \xc2\xa0A number of members of Congress are doing the same. \xc2\xa0Other leaders around the country are engaged in that. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd we understand, and the President has made clear that he understands that these are -- that there are regional differences on some of these issues and there are things that we need to engage in and recognize and make part of the discussion. \xc2\xa0And the Vice President\'s process did that. \xc2\xa0Conversations the President has had with lawmakers who have an interest in taking common-sense measures but who also historically had strong backing when it comes to their support for the Second Amendment -- the President understands all of this, and he understands it\'s all part of the process. \xc2\xa0But he insists that we act.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes. \xc2\xa0Welcome to the front row.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple of questions revolving around the BRAIN Initiative this morning. \xc2\xa0Do you think that this BRAIN Initiative has any chance of moving forward if the President doesn\'t get his way with the budget? \xc2\xa0And if the budget deficit is running into trillions of dollars, how can the President justify proposing spending another $100 million on this?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, everything that the President is proposing will be paid for and will be in keeping with the cap set by the Budget Control Act. \xc2\xa0That\'s number one.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNumber two, there has historically been and there seems to be today bipartisan interest in this kind of innovative research that can pay huge dividends down the road for our country economically, medically, when it comes to the health of our senior citizens who suffer from Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s or others who suffer from Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0I mean, this is -- the potential here is enormous and the investment is relatively small compared to the potential.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President expects that there will be -- that the tradition of bipartisan support for this kind of initiative and this kind of innovation will prevail. \xc2\xa0One of the agencies he\xe2\x80\x99s tasked here with undertaking this initiative is DARPA. \xc2\xa0And as you all know, in its previous incarnation as ARPA, this was the agency that was seminal in the effort -- in creating the Internet and launching so many -- so much economic potential in this country and around the globe.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I think that this is one of those investments, as the President has argued often, that are essential to make if we are going to continue to grow and maintain our lead internationally on the cutting edge of scientific discovery and economic and technological development.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a long shot given the current climate?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\'t. \xc2\xa0Well, no, I think that budgets are all about priorities. \xc2\xa0I think that -- I will stipulate now that the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will not be passed word for word into law. \xc2\xa0It has never happened, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen this time. \xc2\xa0But the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will make clear what his priorities are; and many of those priorities will reflect the kinds of things that have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past and we believe enjoy bipartisan support now. \xc2\xa0And this kind of innovation and research is key to our future economic development. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also key to the health and welfare of the American people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEd.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking about the budget, can you give us an update on the sequester? \xc2\xa0Because yesterday the Customs and Border Protection Agency said that they\'re actually postponing furloughs and overtime cuts for Border Patrol agents. \xc2\xa0I thought, in February, when Secretary Napolitano came out here with you, she told us it was dire, these Border Patrol agents were going to be furloughed, and that we were going to be less safe because of that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think both are true. \xc2\xa0What is a fact is that when you\'re dealing with these kinds of across-the-board, forced budget cuts in the middle of a fiscal year and you\'re having to make all sorts of adjustments to account for them and to reduce your expenditures accordingly, it\xe2\x80\x99s a moving picture. \xc2\xa0And that can be on the plus side, where furloughs may take place a little later, or on the minus side, where things may be more immediate. \xc2\xa0I mean, that\'s just a fact. \xc2\xa0That\'s true at every agency. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut feel free to convey to your readers and viewers that the sequester doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. \xc2\xa0And then --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, well, first of all, let me just stop you, because I didn\'t say it didn\'t matter.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0-- and explain -- nobody said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dire.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I said that the Secretary came in here and said that we were going to be less safe, that people were going to be crossing the border because there are less Border Patrol agents. \xc2\xa0And then they announced yesterday, actually, we\'re not doing that. \xc2\xa0So I\'m not saying it\'s not important. \xc2\xa0I\'m saying, did she mislead the public?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Absolutely not. \xc2\xa0And I\'m saying that this is \xc2\xa0-- I mean, you\'re editorializing enormously in that, but the --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How so? \xc2\xa0February -- I\'ll give you -- February 25th she said, "If you have 5,000 fewer Border Patrol hours or agents, you have 5,000 fewer Border Patrol agents. \xc2\xa0That has a real impact." \xc2\xa0Those are her words. \xc2\xa0That\'s not politicizing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0And how is that not the case?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They announced yesterday they\'re not doing that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, but there are reductions. \xc2\xa0And whether it\'s those Border Patrol --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, what are they?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Go ahead and report that, Ed. \xc2\xa0We\'ve made clear, look --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, she said 5,000. \xc2\xa0They said yesterday, we\'re not doing that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Talk to those who have been laid off at defense industries. \xc2\xa0Talk to those who have been furloughed in the --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about Border Patrol first.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, you can obviously go to DHS and --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, that\'s what she said. \xc2\xa0She said we\'re going to be less safe. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0And the impacts of the sequester will not all be immediate. \xc2\xa0If you can predict to me when the sequester will end -- if it will end -- when Republicans will make the fateful decision to fund Border Patrol agents or fund our national security interests or fund Head Start at appropriate levels rather than continue to extend tax breaks to the wealthy and well-connected, tell me when that happens, and then we can assess what damage was done after the fact. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThere is no question that when you have these kinds of across-the-board budget cuts, as many Republicans warned -- and as many Republicans when they go home to their districts, as we speak, are complaining about -- when they affect their districts, the impacts are real and they affect real people. \xc2\xa0And I know that there hasn\'t been a lot of coverage of the impacts on real people, on the families who had to be engaged in lotteries to see whether their child, on a Friday, was still going to be in Head Start on Monday. \xc2\xa0Tell them it doesn\'t matter. \xc2\xa0Tell them that the impacts aren\'t real. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I take your point. \xc2\xa0Look, this is a moving picture. \xc2\xa0Budgets are big things. \xc2\xa0Outflows and inflows, that\'s why there are constant adjustments being made at each agency as they deal with their budget in terms of what the impacts of sequester are. \xc2\xa0But they are real. \xc2\xa0And they are progressive in the sense that they don\'t all happen at once. \xc2\xa0And when we make predictions about what will happen in the future, it\'s going to change based on how the budget picture looks a month later. \xc2\xa0But they\'re real.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the last thing on this. \xc2\xa0When you said "moving picture," the other thing the administration kept saying in February was that there was no flexibility for these Cabinet Secretaries. \xc2\xa0Republicans were saying they can move money around. \xc2\xa0You said, Secretary Duncan said, others said you can\'t do that; there is no flexibility. \xc2\xa0Now you\'re saying it\'s a moving picture, so the Border Patrol agents won\'t be laid off today but maybe -- I thought there was no flexibility. \xc2\xa0I thought it was indiscriminate, it was across the board --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The law is written the way it\'s written, designed specifically not to allow the kinds of choices that the Budget Control Act and the sequester part of it were written to force Congress to make -- to be arbitrary and indiscriminate. \xc2\xa0And that remains a fact. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat is also true is as time progresses and savings are made by eliminating a contract, for example, or ending new purchases of equipment for a period of time, or other things that can be done, changes about the prognosis for furloughs can be made. \xc2\xa0But that is not -- any more than it was uniform a month ago, it\'s not uniform now. \xc2\xa0And this will fluctuate as time goes on. \xc2\xa0It will fluctuate next month, and if the sequester continues, it will fluctuate on and on and on after that as the agencies adjust to that budget picture.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, thanks. \xc2\xa0Does the President regret at all not doing more events like the one he\'s going to do tomorrow, the one he\'s going to do on Monday, given that when you look at public opinion polls, they actually show support for stiffer gun laws as dropping? \xc2\xa0It\'s not just what\'s happening in Congress, but actually what\'s happening on the American people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the data on this is quite mixed, and when it comes to some of the measures that we\'ve just been talking about, including closing loopholes in our background check system, the data remains very strong and overwhelming in support of doing just that. \xc2\xa0And the President has been doing events, has been talking about gun violence. \xc2\xa0I think the most memorable moment I can recall from a State of the Union address in all the time I\'ve been in Washington occurred at the end of the President\'s State of the Union address this year, when --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I mean going out, going on the road, talking to people like he\'s going to be doing tomorrow and on Monday.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, I have a list here that I can provide you of everything the President and the Vice President have done, and it\'s quite extensive, and the dates are December 16th, December 19th, January 19th, January 16th, January 25th, January 28th, February 4th, February 11th, February 12th, February 15th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 27th. \xc2\xa0These are all presidential and vice presidential engagements or events regarding this very important issue. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I would -- the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge is something that was recognized at the outset by everyone, including this President, including the Vice President. \xc2\xa0The fact that it would require concerted and consistent effort was recognized by the President and is embodied by -- is reflected in the actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken ever since Newtown happened.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s event, Monday\xe2\x80\x99s event, that\'s part of this process. \xc2\xa0Last week\xe2\x80\x99s event is part of this process.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, on North Korea, one foreign policy expert said to me that Kim Jong-il seemed to know where the line was, and that Kim Jong-un doesn\'t. \xc2\xa0Does the President share that assessment? \xc2\xa0And does he therefore see this current leader as being more dangerous and less predictable than his father?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I would say that we are judging the regime by its actions and its -- mostly its actions, but also by its rhetoric. \xc2\xa0And those are the assessments we make, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not personality-based.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe fact is that the pattern we have seen of bellicose rhetoric and provocative behavior long predates the current leader of North Korea, as veterans of previous administrations can tell you. \xc2\xa0So assessments about the current leader are obviously things that outside experts make and inside experts make, but as a policy matter, we base our policy decisions on overall actions and behavior by the regime.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, on the BRAIN Initiative that the President outlined today, you described the $100 million as this small initial investment --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think I said a small investment compared to the potential benefit.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A lot of experts say it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take years and billions of dollars. \xc2\xa0The President himself compared it to the Apollo program, which cost hundreds of billions of dollars. \xc2\xa0How many years, how much money do you think ultimately it will take to sort of achieve what you guys envision?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that the scientific experts are best at predicting how soon breakthroughs will occur. \xc2\xa0And even they, I think as history proves, are not likely to be dead on, spot on in their predictions. \xc2\xa0It\'s impossible to know. \xc2\xa0That\'s what makes this essential and exciting, because the potential is huge. \xc2\xa0But it requires investments that allow for the necessary innovation and research that can bring us to that threshold. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President believes this is the kind of thing that we ought to be doing. \xc2\xa0It is the kind of thing that Republicans and Democrats have supported in the past as part of our economic development. \xc2\xa0And he is very enthusiastic about the prospect for discovery and innovation in this field, as are so many experts in the field. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you said that $100 million is small relative to the potential. \xc2\xa0Do you agree just small relative to the overall cost involved in this initiative?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a projection to lay out to you based on what revelations might come from early stages of research and innovation and development. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is when we talked about budget priorities and we talked about the fact that the President\'s budget will -- the initiatives that are in it will be paid for, and that it has always been his position -- whether it\'s investing in infrastructure or in medical research -- that there are things that we need to do investment-wise, even as we trim our budgets and reduce our deficits, that are essential to future economic growth, and this is one of them.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tRoger.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, the U.N. today passed a treaty regulating world commerce and arms trading. \xc2\xa0The Senate last month opposed a symbolic treaty along those same lines, suggesting it\'s going to be an uphill battle to get it through for ratification. \xc2\xa0How are you going to get it through?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that I can say two things. \xc2\xa0One, we are pleased with the outcome of the conference, and the text achieves the objectives that we set out for this negotiation. \xc2\xa0And we are pleased to join the consensus. \xc2\xa0As is the case with all treaties of this nature, we will follow normal procedures to conduct a thorough review of the treaty text to determine whether to sign the treaty. \xc2\xa0And what that timeline is, I cannot predict to you now. \xc2\xa0And we are just beginning the review process, so I wouldn\'t want to speculate about when that process will end. \xc2\xa0But we\'re certainly encouraged by and pleased by the outcome.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any idea how you\'re going to get it through the Senate?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I think before we get to that, we\'re going to review the treaty and assess it, and then make judgments accordingly.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMara.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just have a question about background checks. \xc2\xa0You pointed out that in many polls it polls above 90 percent. \xc2\xa0Yet Michael Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on this. \xc2\xa0Organizing for America has made it kind of their maiden grassroots effort. \xc2\xa0And the President has been out doing all these events that you cited. \xc2\xa0So what is your theory of the case as to why this seems to be losing steam in Congress?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would at least in part suggest that the process continues. \xc2\xa0And I\'m not sure that I would agree with the assessment that it\'s losing steam. \xc2\xa0I think it has always been challenging. \xc2\xa0I think that predictions that any element of this legislative package would be easily passed were incorrect and probably na\xc3\xafve if and when they were made, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s this particular aspect of it or any other aspect of it. \xc2\xa0This has all traditionally been difficult.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI would note that -- I would send you to members of Congress to explain their position on these issues; if they\xe2\x80\x99re in opposition, why they\xe2\x80\x99re in opposition -- why they\xe2\x80\x99re in opposition to a proposition that has 90 percent support from the American people and that enjoys support in every region of the country, and from Republicans and Democrats and independents.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHaving said that, there are obviously challenges and have traditionally been challenges to moving this kind of legislation. \xc2\xa0I would note that on the background check issue, a number of Republicans are on the record supporting the idea of closing loopholes in background checks. \xc2\xa0A number of them voted for improving our background check system in the late 1990s, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for that. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to explain to readers and viewers and listeners, and that is that background checks are the quintessence of a common-sense approach to how to address this problem. \xc2\xa0And I think most Americans believe it makes absolute sense to check the criminal record of someone before they are allowed to purchase a gun, because they\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to have one otherwise.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re simply saying, let\xe2\x80\x99s enforce the law through an effective background check system to keep weapons away from those who should not by law have them. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why gun-trafficking measures are so important as well. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo having said that, this is always going -- it was always going to be a challenge, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re pressing hard to get it done; why the President is out there making the case, the Vice President is out there making the case; why legislators from both parties have been talking about it. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press for action on it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any other issue that polls above 90 percent and some polls above 94 percent. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering -- there must be a theory for this. \xc2\xa0Is it the power of the NRA? \xc2\xa0I mean, you guys must have some idea of why you think this particular piece of it is proving to be so difficult.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, I used to write articles about this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave the political analysis to others and simply say that, for a host of reasons, advancing legislation that is common-sense and reduces gun violence has always been a challenge and probably always will be. \xc2\xa0But it is essential to try to get it done and move forward on it. \xc2\xa0And the American people expect that it should be done, and they recognize the object rationale behind closing loopholes in the background check system, making sure that people who should not have a gun by law do not obtain a gun, cannot obtain a gun, in a very simple -- and this is about, again, I know I\'m repeating myself to you, but for those who are not engaged in this issue all the time, it\'s important to understand that system exists. \xc2\xa0This is not about creating some registry or background check system. \xc2\xa0The existing system does not -- is not a registry and will not be a registry. \xc2\xa0It is a background check system that is in place, but there are holes in the system and those holes ought to be closed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tApril.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m following up on Mara -- since the NRA and other gun-lobbying groups are so powerful, has this White House thought about meeting with groups like the NRA again since the Vice President\'s meeting with the NRA? \xc2\xa0Has the President thought about it? \xc2\xa0Has the Vice President thought about another meeting?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'re working -- when it comes to the legislation, we\'re obviously working with lawmakers of both parties, and that particular organization has connections and contacts on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any danger in us not knowing where they stand on certain issues and vice versa. \xc2\xa0There has been outreach and I\'m sure -- I\'m not saying there won\'t be continued outreach, but on the legislative side of this, the legislation has been written, it\'s moving through committees, and we\'re engaged in that process right now. \xc2\xa0And we are working with lawmakers of both parties in trying to achieve a compromise that can make this happen, especially when it comes to the background checks.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But realistically, this whole effort started out bigger -- much bigger than what it was, and it\'s boiled down to -- you\'re talking about a consensus on background checks. \xc2\xa0And much of the holdup to include ammunitions, the reduction in magazines, is dealing with the NRA and the ammunition manufacturers. \xc2\xa0Why not come together and talk it over to possibly find common ground to --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Vice President -- the initiative the Vice President --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That was months ago, and they\'re getting ready to come back to Congress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Months ago -- well, first of all, it wasn\'t that long -- it was fairly recent, and it was what helped lead to the initiative, the package of initiatives that the Vice President put forward with the President. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tLook, there are a lot of conversations happening around this issue. \xc2\xa0And the President\'s views on what he believes we should do are clearly stated and reflected in this proposal. \xc2\xa0And I would challenge that it\xe2\x80\x99s all come down to one thing. \xc2\xa0There are other aspects of this that have been moving forward and we are encouraged by that, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press to get it done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last question on this -- realistically, once this is all said and done and a vote happens, what do you expect to pass, realistically?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I would hesitate to make predictions on any of this for the very reason that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying, and that is that it was always going to be a challenge. \xc2\xa0And if any of this were easy -- I mean the sad fact about Newtown is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first of its kind, and the age of the victims made it particularly horrific. \xc2\xa0But there have been other incidents at Virginia Tech and Aurora that are similar. \xc2\xa0And the idea that suddenly all of this would become easy when it had been difficult in the past was never credible, but that doesn\'t mean we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be working hard to get it done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tChristi.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0Is the President planning on weighing in on the Los Angeles mayor\xe2\x80\x99s race? \xc2\xa0Eric Garcetti has been a big supporter of the President over the years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I appreciate the question. \xc2\xa0In keeping with past practice, when there is a primary, a Democratic primary in a race like this, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- the President won\xe2\x80\x99t endorse any candidate. \xc2\xa0Mr. Garcetti is, of course, someone who has been a long-time supporter of the President. \xc2\xa0The President appreciates that support, appreciates their working relationship. \xc2\xa0But we won\xe2\x80\x99t -- there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a formal endorsement.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you expect that they will see each other this week when the President is in California?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure. \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in Northern California.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAlexis.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Colorado and Connecticut, the common theme in those two states is legislative action in the state, at the state level, and I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming the President is going to talk about that when he\xe2\x80\x99s in both states. \xc2\xa0What are the common denominators that the President sees in those two states that compelled them to move in a way that he would like to have Congress pay attention to? \xc2\xa0What are the themes, other than the horror being in their midst? \xc2\xa0But why would they take action when the NRA has been very active at the state level too, whereas Congress is very reluctant?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I might look to state experts to make that analysis. \xc2\xa0I think that you\xe2\x80\x99re right that action has been taken in both states, and I think they -- a thing that connects them terribly is the tragedies that occurred recently in those states. \xc2\xa0Beyond that, I think -- others might have a better assessment about why bipartisan action has happened in those states. \xc2\xa0But I think that reflects the capacity around the country for bipartisan action, including here in Washington.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just to follow up, if the President doesn\'t see the willingness in Congress to do what he would hope at the federal level, to what extent does he hope that states themselves in a piecemeal basis can begin to act?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is focused right now on the proposal he put forward, the set of proposals which includes pieces of legislation at the federal level. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what he is focused on. \xc2\xa0Obviously, he is -- I mean, it is important that other states address this issue as they see fit. \xc2\xa0But right now, we\'re focused on the President\'s initiative.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMark.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, North Korea again. \xc2\xa0You spoke about the mismatch between rhetoric and not seeing deployments change on the ground or mobilization. \xc2\xa0Specifically on the Yongbyon reactor, have we seen any sign, any preparations that the North Koreans are going to try and restart it? \xc2\xa0And beyond that, does the President -- would he accept the restarting of that reactor? \xc2\xa0Would he take steps to stop it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, we do not accept a violation of international obligations by the North Koreans. \xc2\xa0And we have -- take action through the United Nations and elsewhere through sanctions and other measures that isolate and put pressure on North Korea for its violations of its international obligations. \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to predict what next steps will be if this action is followed through on. \xc2\xa0I believe it was an announcement that North Korea just made. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any other information to impart to you about that facility.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut this -- again, this is in keeping with a pattern. \xc2\xa0And that behavior has been met with and responded to -- met with action by the international community, responded to often through consensus as it was at the Security Council not long ago.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJon-Christopher. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, this is the 60th anniversary of the so-called armistice, which Kim Jong-un has basically rescinded. \xc2\xa0The conflict there has been going on during 12 presidential administrations. \xc2\xa0Has this administration been in touch with any of those individuals, going back to the Truman administration, who can lend some insight and some regional acumen basically to the President in terms of advice?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have any specific conversations the President has had to read out to you. \xc2\xa0The President is constantly speaking with those with expertise in different areas of both foreign policy and domestic policy, and I\'m confident that he has had conversations with experts outside of government on this issue. \xc2\xa0But I have no specific ones to read out to you. \xc2\xa0It is certainly the case that this is -- North Korea\'s actions have been something that successive administrations have had to deal with, especially the last several.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Last one, Ann -- I\'m sorry, I did say Connie. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the BRAIN research -- and thank you very much -- just some follow ups. \xc2\xa0Will there be any private investment into this? \xc2\xa0Is there any congressional opposition that you know of? \xc2\xa0And would you please announce when there are clinical trials so that people who need them can try to get --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t think it will be for the White House to announce clinical trials. \xc2\xa0I would point you to those who are overseeing the initiative at the agencies the President mentioned today. \xc2\xa0I\'m going to go out on a limb and suggest that there might be some congressional opposition. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I said earlier that there has been indication that there is bipartisan support for this kind of initiative, this specific initiative, but I can\'t predict where that will end up.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat I do know is that this is something that does not have a political or partisan flavor to it. \xc2\xa0This is the kind of potentially breakthrough research that results in enormous advances in the health of the American people as well as enormous economic advances, potentially. \xc2\xa0So it\'s the kind of thing that we have done in the past successfully and we should continue to do. \xc2\xa0That\'s what the President believes. \xc2\xa0Thanks.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Private firms -- will private drug firms be involved?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think we put out a lot of paper on this in terms of how the investments are made and leveraging issues.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnn.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Real quickly -- should the oil spill in Arkansas that blackened a neighborhood have any impact on the State Department\'s or the President\'s consideration of Keystone XL?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, the assessment of that particular pipeline is ongoing at the State Department, and they assess a range of criteria. \xc2\xa0And obviously, the assessments they make based on environmental impacts and the assessments that were made in the past had to do with some of these issues. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have anything for you specific on that, because it\'s a process that\'s underway at the State Department. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you spoken to the President about the Arkansas spill? \xc2\xa0I know you were asked about it. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have not.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You still haven\'t spoken to him about it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0About that issue, no. \xc2\xa0Thanks.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t1:40 P.M. EDT</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
