EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, everybody, for getting on. We appreciate you taking the time.\xc2\xa0 Today we have the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor Tom Donilon and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes, who are here to talk a little bit about Libya and take some questions from you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Tom.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 All set?\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Tommy.\xc2\xa0 And thanks, everybody, for taking the time this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We thought it would be a useful exercise to spend some time this afternoon not just talking about Libya, which I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to do, and Ben is as well, but also to talk about how we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about the broader set of events in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we do view them as a broad set of events.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to overstate the significance of the change, the historic change that is sweeping the region.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged, as I know many of you know, in efforts really across the region, from Tunisia all the way to obviously our ongoing efforts in Iraq.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I thought what I\xe2\x80\x99d do at the outset here is lay down several principles that inform our approach and have informed our approach from the outset.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll then talk about a couple of specifics.\xc2\xa0 I also want to talk about an issue that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t spent a lot of time talking to you all about in recent days, which is Iran.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of things to say on that.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, with respect to our overall approach, essentially how we think about this and how we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching the challenges, and let me make a couple of observations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFirst, the turmoil in the region, the events in the region, present challenges as well as historic opportunities for the United States and for the people of the region.\xc2\xa0 These are indigenous movements, first and foremost, and they do offer an opportunity to transform the narrative that defined the Arab world for decades.\xc2\xa0 Democratic movements that have emerged can also counter and are countering, I think, the extremist narrative of violent political change that al Qaeda and affiliated groups, as well as Iranian exported violent revolution that have -- are seen as narratives in the region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is a strong counter-narrative.\xc2\xa0 This is really an important point I think.\xc2\xa0 These are indigenous movements.\xc2\xa0 They are movements by people seeking more representative and responsive government.\xc2\xa0 They run quite counter to the narratives of al Qaeda and the Iranian narrative -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that in a minute.\xc2\xa0 These really are movements that are tremendous examples of people pursuing their aspirations in a non-violent fashion.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a critically important point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s enormous opportunities in this current situation.\xc2\xa0 And as you all know, I am charged day in and day out to plan to avoid ranges of possible negative outcomes in situations, but I think we also have to prepare to take advantage of the profound movement here and really not be paralyzed in any way by the potential downsides, but really be prepared to embrace the positive upsides of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecond, our efforts are based on a set of key principles that the President articulated from the outset.\xc2\xa0 One, we oppose violence and repression.\xc2\xa0 Two, we work in the approach to this situation from the perspective of a set of universal values that the President articulated quite clearly.\xc2\xa0 And three, we support a process of political change that opens up societies and leads to governments that are more responsive to the aspirations of the people of the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThird, we strongly support reform as the basis for stability in the region.\xc2\xa0 We support peaceful and meaningful democratic transitions throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 In particular, we support the right to free expression, political participation, confidence in the rule of law, and governments that are transparent and responsive and accountable to their people.\xc2\xa0 We believe that such reform is the basis for stability in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNext, it\xe2\x80\x99s not only political reform that\xe2\x80\x99s important here\xc2\xa0 -- and I want to make this point very strongly -- it\xe2\x80\x99s also the economic change and economic reform, and we are very, very focused on this.\xc2\xa0 It is key to the success of these transitions to representative and responsive government.\xc2\xa0 We are very tightly focused on a range of efforts here to promote economic change and economic reform through our own bilateral assistance efforts, by leveraging our leadership in the international financial institutions that are focused on this -- on reform in the region, and, frankly, through our efforts with wealthier nations in the region who also need to work with us and work with their fellow nations in the region in order not to miss this opportunity. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is a very important piece of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, that will be an important focus of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s trip to the region next week, where she\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Tunisia and in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before getting into specifics, I wanted to talk about Egypt as part of talking about the entire sweep of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at here.\xc2\xa0 While I\xe2\x80\x99m sure on this call we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a lot of time talking about Libya, and that\xe2\x80\x99s important and we\xe2\x80\x99re tightly focused on that, but we also are focused on the broad sweep of events in the region, including major events where Egypt really is at the center. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The success of the democratic transformation underway in Egypt is absolutely critical.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the largest Arab country.\xc2\xa0 It is, again, at the center of events in the region and is a very tight and important focus for us, which is why, of course, Secretary Clinton will be going there next week as the highest ranking United States official to visit Egypt since President Mubarak left office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Along those lines, I spoke to Field Marshal Tantawi the day before yesterday, and I wanted to talk about that for a couple of minutes because I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 I thanked Marshal Tantawi for his leadership of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, and communicated to him that the world continues to admire the Egyptian people\xe2\x80\x99s transition to a democratic government; reiterated our commitment to partnership with Egypt in this project and in helping the Egyptian people achieve a successful transition. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I spent time discussing a number of steps that the Supreme Council of Armed Forces had taken, including continuing to allow Egyptians freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, putting in place a process for the constitutional amendments to be voted on by the Egyptian people, and pursuing reforms responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I noted the fact that Field Marshal Tantawi made a number of difficult changes in the cabinet and appointed a new Prime Minister Sharaf; encouraged him to continue to lay the foundation for free, fair, credible elections; protect universal rights of the Egyptian people; and pursue a transparent dialogue with the broadest possible range of Egyptian civil society.\xc2\xa0 And I thanked him for the government of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in helping address the humanitarian situation in Libya -- where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with them.\xc2\xa0 And of course, as many of you know, we also -- we\xe2\x80\x99re directly involved in the transportation through the establishment of an air bridge from the Libyan-Tunisian border back to Egypt for many Egyptians who had been in Libya and were trapped at the border.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya.\xc2\xa0 Let me go through three or four things that constitute an integrated, comprehensive strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in place.\xc2\xa0 And our government has been focused on this as an all of government -- all of government effort, again, in an integrated way as part of our overall effort in the region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has made it crystal-clear that Qaddafi has lost legitimacy to lead, he\xe2\x80\x99s lost the confidence of his people and should leave.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s sent a powerful signal I think that history is not on Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s side and he isolated.\xc2\xa0 And let me go through six or seven points very quickly with respect to our overall effort because it does constitute I think, as I said, a comprehensive strategy aimed at the goal of seeing Qaddafi leave office and having the Libyan people move to a transition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, we did work to ensure that the international community spoke with one voice on this, the United States, the Europeans, the U.N., the Arab League, African Union and others deliver a clear message.\xc2\xa0 This has not just been the West engaged in isolation of Colonel Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 It has been a broad range of countries.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s critically important as we go forward here.\xc2\xa0 He really is an isolated person now in Tripoli.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, we\xe2\x80\x99ve imposed strong sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We moved quickly, indeed before the United Nations Security Council resolution was passed on Saturday, the 26th -- we moved on Friday, the 25th -- to impose very tough sanctions, including the freezing of over $32 billion of the Qaddafi regime\xe2\x80\x99s assets through our own unilateral sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We moved that evening at 8:00 p.m. that night.\xc2\xa0 We had a principals committee meeting that day that I chaired; we worked through a number of these issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We were concerned because we knew that the $30 billion was in an account that could be frozen by the United States and we moved at 8:00 p.m. that evening to ensure that the Qaddafi regime did not undertake any steps to get their hands on the assets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve coordinated additional sanctions with our European partners and they have enhanced those sanctions just in the last day or so.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen announcements from Lady Ashton.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve worked with the United Nations on a very tough set of sanctions, and we are expanding our own designations and sanctions to include more members of the Qaddafi regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This $32 billion really does constitute essentially assets held in escrow by the United States for the future of Libya.\xc2\xa0 And as a new government, more representative government, emerges in Libya, ultimately this will be an very important corpus of assets to give the new Libyan leadership a leg up on its task forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Third, the President made clear we\'re taking steps to ensure that members of the Qaddafi regime are held accountable.\xc2\xa0 This is very important.\xc2\xa0 The United Nations Security Council resolution that was passed on -- I think I\'ve got this right -- the 26th of February referred the Qaddafi regime to the International Criminal Court.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to be expanding these designations along the way, including using our intelligence assets to monitor Libyan activities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President said the other day, those individuals around Qaddafi who are taking orders from Qaddafi and executing his plans need to think very carefully about this.\xc2\xa0 They need to think about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing to their fellow citizens and they need to think about what the consequences are.\xc2\xa0 Walking away now versus participating is the difference between the international community pursuing them to justice, and all the way, and a different future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fourth, we have been in direct contact with the opposition through a variety of channels in an intensive way and we\'ve been tracking these contacts through a matrix that we\'ve been running here at the White House -- been in direct contact with a variety of channels.\xc2\xa0 This includes, by the way, senior members of the Council and other individuals within Libya.\xc2\xa0 We\'re coordinating directly with them to provide assistance and determine the best ways we can support their aspirations and understand their leadership structures and their intention.\xc2\xa0 We want to hear from them about the situation on the ground, what their plans are, what their recommendations are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I\'ve said, we\'ve been in close contact with these opposition representatives.\xc2\xa0 As Secretary Clinton said today in her testimony -- where was it, Tommy?\xc2\xa0 In the House -- House Appropriations today -- that she will meet -- intends to meet with opposition representatives next week.\xc2\xa0 And in addition to that, like I said, there are meetings outside Libya -- we\'re prepared to send diplomats to Benghazi to engage the opposition inside Libya.\xc2\xa0 This will be helpful to our understanding of the situation on the ground, allow us to facilitate humanitarian assistance. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd to that end I also thought it would be useful for you to know that we\'ll soon be sending disaster assistance relief teams into eastern Libya and we have for some time been funding about a dozen NGOs and international organizations who are actively assisting folks in the eastern part of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, Secretary Clinton also said today and I want to underscore that we\'re suspending Libya\xe2\x80\x99s embassy in the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not accepting Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s representatives in Washington. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over time, of course, this will really squeeze and tighten the containment effort around Qaddafi, encourage and provide incentives for those members of the Libyan government to disassociate themselves from Qaddafi, as I said earlier, and again, underscoring that before someone carries out an attack on Libyan civilians they need to know they face a sharp choice and they need to know they\xe2\x80\x99ll be on the wrong side of history and we will ensure they face the consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fifth, we\'re providing assistance to support humanitarian needs of the Libyan people and those leaving Libya.\xc2\xa0 We have helped to repatriate a number of individuals who have been displaced including, as I said earlier, through the use of the air bridge to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We\'re providing assistance directly to the people in eastern Libya through the NGOs, as I said, and they\xe2\x80\x99re operating on the ground.\xc2\xa0 As I said, we\'re going to send in our DART team. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And sixth and finally in this presentation, we\'re pursuing a range of military options.\xc2\xa0 We called this week\xe2\x80\x99s meetings at NATO.\xc2\xa0 Our ambassador, Ivo Daalder, briefed you earlier on a number of things that we had put on the table going forward here. And today Secretary General Rasmussen announced a number of steps that the Alliance is taking:\xc2\xa0 Increase maritime assets in the central Mediterranean; defense ministers also agreed to move ahead with detailed operational planning on two really important projects I think -- humanitarian relief and more active enforcement of the arms embargo; continuing plans for the full range of possibilities and planning -- full range of possibilities including a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 These plans will be presented next week at NATO.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as I\'ve briefed earlier in the week, I would also remind -- earlier this week NATO agreed to put AWACs up over the Mediterranean 24/7 to expand surveillance and coordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Defense ministers agreed that any military action by NATO to respond to a demonstrable need had a sound legal basis.\xc2\xa0 And we do seek regional support.\xc2\xa0 This is really important.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just regional rhetorical support.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to be seeking actual support by those nations -- the Arab League, the GCC and the African nations -- to participate in any of these efforts as they go forward.\xc2\xa0 Again, not just rhetorical support, but actual participation -- which we think is absolutely critical for a variety of reasons that most of you can certainly understand and we can talk about in detail if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, European Council leaders are meeting tomorrow in Libya and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work closely with the EU -- and I\'ve been in touch with many of my European colleagues during the course of today to ensure the closest possible coordination between NATO and the EU so we can maximize efficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond this, we\'re exploring additional sanctions by the United Nations Security Council resolution that will permit more active steps.\xc2\xa0 As we develop scenarios, as we develop planning in response to the situation on the ground, if we need additional United Nations Security Council authorities we will go get that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, in sum, we\'ve isolated Qaddafi, denied him resources, ensuring accountability, building and maintaining international support, building capabilities to assist the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be resolved overnight.\xc2\xa0 But I think looking at our efforts here -- and we obviously have an investment -- we\'ve acted quite swiftly and steadily to ramp up our efforts here in Libya, as we have across the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more topic and then I\'ll take questions -- on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And the reason I wanted to raise it is that -- and some of your papers have had these stories about how somehow the changes in the Middle East that we\'ve seen over the last couple of months work to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.\xc2\xa0 This is really an important point to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In sharp contrast to the activities in Tahrir Square in Cairo and throughout the region, Iran has really laid bare its hypocrisy.\xc2\xa0 It applauds universal rights of others in the region but continues to suppress its own people, including mass arrests and killing those who dare speak out against the regime.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise from my perspective -- who has been at the forefront of our efforts with respect to trying to deal with the Iranian nuclear program -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s trying to divert attention. It\xe2\x80\x99s had grave difficulty delivering economic progress.\xc2\xa0 The leadership is out of touch and its narrative of exporting the Islamic revolution has been discredited across the region, as well as within Iran.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran is isolated on its nuclear program and support for terrorism.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to enhance that isolation.\xc2\xa0 And the bottom line is this:\xc2\xa0 The Iranian narrative really does, I think if you do a sharp analysis of this, fall in a quite empty way across the region when compared to the historic changes underway.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Mr. Donilon.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could give us what information you have on the reported firing by Saudi Arabian police on protesters there, and what kind of conversations you\xe2\x80\x99ve had about how the Saudis might deal with future protests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Ben, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the reports.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Nick, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly aware of those reports and, again, consistent with the presentation that Tom gave, what we have said to the Saudis and to all the people of the region is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to support a set of universal values in any country in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the right to peaceful assembly, to peaceful protest, to peaceful speech.\xc2\xa0 So, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a message that we\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated in public and in private to the government of Saudi Arabia and to all the governments of the region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ll of course continue to closely monitor this particular situation, get as many facts as we can about exactly what transpired, since these reports are relatively recent.\xc2\xa0 And again, going forward, though, our message will remain the same as it has been in any country as it relates to the right of people to peaceful protest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Mr. Donilon.\xc2\xa0 I noticed you didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak very specifically about the possibility of military action, and I think some folks might have a bit of a -- taking a somewhat jaundiced view of this might say that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of activity going on without any sort of specific way to bridge this desire to have Qaddafi removed.\xc2\xa0 Can you just -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered this question in various forms from time to time -- but can you just go through the potential set of options that are currently on the table, ranging from the no-fly zone to other -- to humanitarian actions, and just analyze the potential benefits and potential drawbacks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Glenn, without getting into -- thanks for the question.\xc2\xa0 Without getting into specific military planning, let me make three or four points in response to your good question. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is that military steps -- and they can be kinetic and non-kinetic, obviously, the full range -- are not the only method by which we and the international community are pressuring Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 I think that the really important point I wanted to get across in this presentation, that we have taken a range of steps that I outlined to squeeze Qaddafi, isolate him, really turn him into a pariah.\xc2\xa0 Again, actions not just by the West, but indeed by the entire international community, including a full range of regional actors -- the Arab League, the African Union, GCC.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it really is important in any analysis or writing that\'s done on this that those steps not be underestimated.\xc2\xa0 These are the initial steps that have been taken.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, the fact is Qaddafi is isolated, his resources are being impaired.\xc2\xa0 He has, in fact -- through the efforts of the people of Libya, now faces a situation where my rough estimate is that half the population of Libya is no longer under regime control, but rather under the control of areas where the opposition is providing governance.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second point, the range of options that are on the table at NATO are the ones that we outlined, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99re really important.\xc2\xa0 We have moved in a number of maritime assets, as I said.\xc2\xa0 And this does begin to give -- use the situational awareness and surveillance capabilities that you want going forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecond, there are three sets of options that were laid out at NATO for planning.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, the idea here is that should the international community want to move here, if the United Nations passed an empowering resolution that, in fact, these assets -- which are substantial and have command and control aspects that are very important -- we\xe2\x80\x99d be prepared to go. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the three that were outlined here are important.\xc2\xa0 It is humanitarian assistance, which could be by air or could be by sea.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, there are ports obviously where such humanitarian assistance could be delivered, like Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it would have to be worked out with the opposition groups that control various aspects in the east, but they could also be air provisions of non-lethal humanitarian relief.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThird, NATO is uniquely positioned to enforce the United Nations Security Council arms embargo, and that\xe2\x80\x99s another piece of it.\xc2\xa0 Now, you can go down a full range of issues beyond that, steps beyond that, that I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to do on this call.\xc2\xa0 But it really does all fall into the -- and the no-fly zone, by the way, obviously which has been on the table and planning for which is being done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, you could, and indeed we have, looked at a full range of additional options which fall into various baskets, if you will, that range from additional kinds of supply to the opposition; as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, thinking through a no-fly zone proposal and whether or not that makes sense and it actually is responsive to the challenges; to additional kinds of surveillance going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be appropriate for me to go through the full range, except to represent to you that the full range has been prepared and assessed by our government.\xc2\xa0 And on the international basis, the range I outlined to you and that Secretary General Rasmussen talked about today have been assessed at NATO.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, a couple of further points.\xc2\xa0 International efforts here, international support is important going forward here.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of nations which have interest in what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Libya, in addition to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important in our judgment to have international support moving forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecond, that international support I think would be really enhanced -- and the activities that might be undertaken be really enhanced by, as I said earlier, active Arab participation, not just rhetorical support, going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNext, we are engaged, Glenn, directly, as I said, with the opposition groups.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton, as she announced during her House testimony today, is going to be meeting with opposition groups.\xc2\xa0 And we have been for a number of days, maybe longer than that, engaged, talking to opposition groups about what the needs are in the -- of these groups; as I said, what their organization structure, the decision-making structures -- their motivations are, their goals are, going forward.\xc2\xa0 And from that, those sets of encounters, we will be able to, I think -- we and others -- be able to construct in a more informed way the kinds of steps that we might take next. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Donilon, can you give a few more details about the aid teams that you mentioned are going into eastern Libya?\xc2\xa0 Will they have military protection?\xc2\xa0 And do you consider this intervention?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 There was kind of an echo there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Do you want me to repeat the question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I think I got it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say -- why don\xe2\x80\x99t you repeat the question so I make sure I got it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Referring to what you said earlier about aid going into eastern Libya, will those teams have military protection?\xc2\xa0 And if so, do you -- is there any way that this might be construed as military intervention?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 A couple of points on that.\xc2\xa0 No, these are humanitarian assistance teams.\xc2\xa0 They are not going in, in any way, shape, or form as military operations.\xc2\xa0 They go in with the cooperation of the authorities who are running the operations on the ground in eastern Libya.\xc2\xa0 And it can in no way, shape, or form be seen as military intervention.\xc2\xa0 This is focused on providing the kind of assessment you need to ensure that the most effective humanitarian assistance that can be provided by the United States and by the international community is being delivered.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to answer your question quite directly:\xc2\xa0 No, not a military operation at all; not going in with military or security personnel; going in working with the permission of and the cooperation of the local entities now who are in de facto control of areas in eastern Libya.\xc2\xa0 And it can in no way be seen as a military intervention.\xc2\xa0 This is purely humanitarian in order for the international community to better assist in a humanitarian way the people of Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, this is Ben Rhodes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just add a couple points to what Tom said there.\xc2\xa0 You have to think about -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s several lines of effort on the assistance front.\xc2\xa0 In the first instance, there is the help that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing to people who are flowing out of the country.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the air bridge to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That includes chartering flights for other people to return to their homes.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the money that the President announced has been allotted to support the efforts along the border.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the assistance being provided to the people of Libya within Libya.\xc2\xa0 Right now as we speak there are already NGOs on the ground in Libya providing assistance to the Libyan people, including NGOs who have the support, financial support, of the U.S. government. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTo further support that effort, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is have the capability to pre-position these DART teams.\xc2\xa0 As you may know, these are teams that are used to dealing in difficult circumstances.\xc2\xa0 They played a big role, for instance, in Haiti in terms of surveilling the needs there and helping to coordinate the assistance.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re purely civilian humanitarian teams that are accustomed to dealing in difficult, disaster-like situations and circumstances.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99d of course be operating within areas, as Tom said, that are already under the control of the opposition, no longer under the control of the Qaddafi regime, and therefore we\xe2\x80\x99d be doing this in consultation and coordination with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then lastly, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the additional prospect of further assistance flowing in to the Libyan people through channels such as the port in Benghazi, which is the type of action that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about with some of our international partners.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 And you know, Jim -- on that, just one last point because it goes back to Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s question as well.\xc2\xa0 As I said, we are in contact with the opposition groups in Libya.\xc2\xa0 There is real sensitivity here about the issue that you raise and it\xe2\x80\x99s important sensitivity.\xc2\xa0 This is an indigenous effort.\xc2\xa0 The people of Libya have, against all the predictions that anyone might have made several months ago, again have control over half -- or about half of the country of Libya.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely important to recognize the indigenous nature of these efforts and to be responsive to kinds of requests along the humanitarian lines that we are talking about here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be crystal-clear about our answer to your question, which is this is humanitarian, not military.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s been real concerns by the -- not just the opposition in Libya, but also other countries in the region about military steps on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tom, if you could comment on DNI Clapper on the Hill today was asked a couple of questions that raised eyebrows, one of which was he said that Libya is a stalemate back and forth, but I think over the longer term the regime will prevail.\xc2\xa0 And then second, he seemed to surprise even Senator Levin by saying that China and Russia, in that order, pose the greatest threat to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I was just wondering if you could comment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the -- let me do the Libya-related question.\xc2\xa0 I may ask Ben to take the China question -- because I did see the DNI\xe2\x80\x99s transcript, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at the transcript on the China/Russia thing, Jake, but thank you for your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I guess I would answer it this way:\xc2\xa0 that if you did a static and one-dimensional assessment of just looking at order of battle and mercenaries, you can come to various conclusions about the various advantages that the Qaddafi regime and the opposition have.\xc2\xa0 But our view is, my view is -- as the person who looks at this quite closely every day and advises the President -- is that things in the Middle East right now and things in Libya in particular right now need to be looked at not through a static but a dynamic, and not through a unidimensional but a multidimensional lens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if you look at it in that way, beyond a narrow view, on just kind of numbers of weapons and things like that, you get a very different picture.\xc2\xa0 The lost legitimacy matters.\xc2\xa0 The isolation of the region matters.\xc2\xa0 Denying the regime resources matters.\xc2\xa0 And this can affect the sustainability of their efforts over time.\xc2\xa0 Motivation matters.\xc2\xa0 Incentives matter.\xc2\xa0 The people of Libya are determined to effect their future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd indeed, Jake, if you had looked at this just through a static, unidimensional lens 45 days ago and you and I had been discussing whether or not it was possible that the Qaddafi regime would lose control over half the people in his country, we would say probably not.\xc2\xa0 But change is the order of the day in the Middle East right now.\xc2\xa0 And again, you have to look at things fresh and you have to take into account, as I said, the dynamics as well as the multidimensional nature of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is, is that a static, unidimensional analysis does not take into account steps that can be taken in cooperation with the opposition going forward here.\xc2\xa0 So I understand how -- I do this every day -- I understand how someone can do a static analysis, order of battle, numbers of weapons and things like that.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the most informative analysis, frankly.\xc2\xa0 I think the analysis needs to be dynamic and it needs to be multidimensional.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s responsive.\xc2\xa0 And again, based on that analysis, I think that you could come to different conclusions about how this is going to go forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last on this -- Qaddafi is isolated and the isolation is fairly complete in the world.\xc2\xa0 His resources are being cut off.\xc2\xa0 The international community is engaged in an increasingly deep way with the opposition.\xc2\xa0 So I would just caution that a dynamic and a multidimensional analysis is more appropriate in the circumstance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, you may have seen the transcript on the other question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99m familiar with the other question.\xc2\xa0 And again, there I think it is a matter of capability versus intent.\xc2\xa0 Clearly China and Russia do not represent our biggest adversaries in the world today, or the nations that we perceive to pose the greatest threat in terms of their intent to harm U.S. interests.\xc2\xa0 We obviously spend a lot of time focused on, as a non-state actor, al Qaeda, but then nations like North Korea and Iran that pose a challenge to U.S. interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of pure capability, obviously China and Russia are nations with large nuclear arsenals and large armies.\xc2\xa0 But we have pursued a policy from the beginning of this administration of building cooperative relationships with the Chinese and the Russians and, frankly, those efforts have yielded concrete benefits that have served U.S. interests as well as Chinese and Russian interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, these are two nations that have extraordinary capabilities in the securities here, but they are two nations that we are building cooperative relationships with, whereas when you look at the issue of intent -- again, intent to be an adversary to the United States, that leads you to focus on nations such as North Korea, organizations such as al Qaeda, who again are a great focus of what we do here every day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 And, Jake, listening to Ben\xe2\x80\x99s comment on that, I mean, again, if you do a static, arithmetic analysis, that can take you to a conclusion, but it really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t inform a threat analysis. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we have from the beginning, as you know, worked very hard on the great power relationships because the platform of a productive, constructive set of great power relationships provide the opportunity for the United States to pursue its interests in the most effective way.\xc2\xa0 And I think the work that we have done building up the relationship with the Russians, across a range of issues that you\xe2\x80\x99re intimately familiar with, and with the Chinese -- which is an effort, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been deeply involved in -- whereby we tried to build out a productive and constructive relationship -- really do affect that analysis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say -- and again, if you look at our quadrennial defense review, if you look at a number of the core foundational documents about our defense posture, that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that we are in any way not cognizant of various circumstances.\xc2\xa0 But the overall strategic thrust has been to try to build productive and constructive relationships with the great powers as a way to most effectively pursue United States interests. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd indeed, these conversations, we\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued these great power relationship strategies in a very intensive way, not just through kind of periodic summits every six months or year, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- now had nine face-to-face meetings with Hu Jintao.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden met with Vice President Putin -- Prime Minister Putin today in Moscow as part of our ongoing efforts to work on areas of common concern with the Russians.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 First of all, is the President happy with an intelligence chief who conducts static and one-dimensional analysis?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, you say that this does not take into -- General Clapper\xe2\x80\x99s assessment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take into account steps taken with the opposition.\xc2\xa0 I mean, does that mean military steps?\xc2\xa0 Because his analysis would suggest -- and the military dimension is clearly very important when you\xe2\x80\x99re clinging onto power -- that they need something to tip the balance. Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 On the first question, the President is very happy with the performance of General Clapper and we work together every single day.\xc2\xa0 I was asked a question about the statement, and I think my judgment on the statement is a static analysis and that you need to take into account the dynamics.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On working with the opposition as part of the dynamics analysis, what I said is that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take into account, kind of looking to the future in the increasing work that the international community is doing with the opposition, beginning now with political support, humanitarian support, and deepening those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best answer for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I\xe2\x80\x99d just echo one point that Tom made earlier, which is that if you look at the trajectory of our own efforts with the international community in terms of a steady ramping up of our sanctions, in terms of the introduction of accountability measures, in terms of the provision assistance, and in terms of the consideration of a range of military options, some of which are already in train, those are obviously going to affect the dynamic within Libya. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly, if you look at the trajectory in the region, as Tom said, change has been the order of the day.\xc2\xa0 And I think that any assessment of the situation right now would suggest that history is not on the side of Muammar Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 History is on the side of the Libyan people, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be the ones who determine their future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we are very clear in having a policy that recognizes that history is on the side of the Libyan people, and that those who are around Qaddafi, as they make their own calculations, must understand that dynamic within their country and understand that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be held accountable if they continue to side with the regime that, again, has been brutalizing its own people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 I think we have time for one last question so this will be our final question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the static analysis, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Why would the administration present a static one-dimensional assessment to Congress and the world about something this critical?\xc2\xa0 It seems to me that that undercuts, first of all, the obligation to inform Congress fully, and to present a coherent picture of your assessment to the world.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if Qaddafi is not entrenched and is going -- is not going to succeed, as General Clapper suggested today, said today, then don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that that is basically presenting a false intelligence assessment to the public -- intelligence assessment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, if you wait for an international consensus -- which is unlikely to come at the U.N. and, therefore, not to come at NATO -- aren\xe2\x80\x99t you increasing the likelihood that your pressure, squeezing him through sanctions and other means will not dislodge him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Andrea, on the first question, again, I think that General Clapper was presenting a kind of a flat-out resources analysis in terms of the regime.\xc2\xa0 And he went through\xc2\xa0 -- if you look at the transcript -- he went through the kind of equipment and resources that the regime has.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at it, he said from a standpoint of attrition, if you do an attrition analysis, you get to his conclusion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about looking to the future here, and talking about taking into account various dynamics that I think are in train and could be in train going forward.\xc2\xa0 So, again, if you had sat here and you and I had this conversation 45 days ago, and I had said, my analysis is that Qaddafi would lose half his country by March 10th, we would have said just based on capabilities and numerical arithmetic analysis, that that\xe2\x80\x99s highly unlikely. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the dynamics in the region are just more dynamic -- are just moving faster than that.\xc2\xa0 And there are things underway here across the region that have presented us with circumstances that a year ago, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, would not have come to the fore in a conversation that you and I might be having.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99d agree with that, that the changed dynamics in the region have been of a historic nature. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, of course, is that people, especially young people -- and it varies from country to country -- have confronted regimes that are not performing for them or that have been repressing them and the fear dynamic has been lost.\xc2\xa0 And when the fear dynamic is lost, the overwhelming force analysis changes pretty dramatically.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that across the region over the last couple of months.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s my response to that.\xc2\xa0 If you ask -- if you just do an intelligence assessment of assets, as I said, a unidimensional assessment of assets, you come to a pretty clear -- you come to a set of conclusions.\xc2\xa0 But I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- and we have been obviously closely following these dynamics across the region -- that, in fact, these outcomes are not at all preordained, and there can be, as we talked about in response to an earlier question, there can also be other events and dynamics that intervene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, I went on so long I forgot the second part of your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether if you wait for an international consensus Qaddafi will be completely entrenched.\xc2\xa0 And I guess a subset of that is, is there going to be a move towards doing what France has done in recognizing the opposition as some sort of provisional government now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve suspended the embassy here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Taking the question from the back end, a couple of points.\xc2\xa0 Number one, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been directly engaged with the opposition groups in learning about the structures that have been emerging, the leadership, who they are, who they represent, and what their goals are.\xc2\xa0 That process has been underway and will be intensified and, indeed, Secretary Clinton will be meeting with representatives of the opposition, as she announced at the hearing today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecond, as we said earlier in the conversation, we are working directly with, if you will, the de facto group that is running the governmental functions in the eastern part of the country.\xc2\xa0 These are the folks with whom we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about assistance efforts.\xc2\xa0 These are the folks who came to Europe in the last couple days and with whom Secretary Clinton will be meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there has been -- I guess I would -- pushing past kind of the complicated legal analysis around recognition, non-recognition -- would point to the practical engagement in working with these groups as the de facto authorities in parts of Libya where they are in control.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, on the first part of your -- the second part of your question, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to build out international support, particularly among the nations in the region as we go forward here, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to undertake some of the options that are on the table.\xc2\xa0 And I think, frankly, if you look at history, that in fact the United States and the international community have moved in a pretty expeditious fashion. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty familiar with the history of a number of these things, as you know, and I think the fact is that the United States, the international community has moved in a pretty broad way pretty quickly.\xc2\xa0 And we can, maybe offline, we can go through some of the calendars of prior examples if you wanted to do that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for getting on and we appreciate your time.\xc2\xa0 And we will send out a transcript as soon as it\xe2\x80\x99s ready.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I really do want to thank everybody for the questions.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to take the opportunity to talk more broadly.\xc2\xa0 And I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I really want to go back to the top of our conversation, which is we are focused on, obviously, issues in Libya given the -- particularly the great humanitarian interests that are at stake there.\xc2\xa0 But we also remain focused on the broad range of challenges here in the region.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important from our perspective, for the White House and the administration to be doing that, given the stakes, because there really is a tremendous opportunity in the region, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us not to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously deal with the crisis of the day, but not to lose sight of the fact that there are very big changes underway in places like Egypt, which really can make a -- really will make a historic difference depending on the direction in which they go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou all have been terrific.\xc2\xa0 I really appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 Look forward to talking to you again.\xc2\xa0 Thank you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND</p>\n<p>3:36 P.M.
