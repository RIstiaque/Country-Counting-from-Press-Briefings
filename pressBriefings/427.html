Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the delay in getting things started today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a busy Thursday afternoon here in August at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Let me do one quick announcement at the top, Josh, and then we\'ll let you get started with the questions, okay?</p>\n<p>As many of you are aware, there are two significant storms in the Pacific Ocean that are moving in the direction of Hawaii. Today the President received an update from his Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco, on preparations that are already underway related to Hurricanes Iselle and Julio.\xc2\xa0 In anticipation of Hurricane Iselle making landfall, FEMA has personnel on the ground who are positioned in the Pacific area year-round.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also an incident management assistance team that has been deployed to the state to coordinate with local officials should support be requested or needed.</p>\n<p>Here at the White House, administration officials are staying in close contact with FEMA and other agencies that will be helping with the response and recovery efforts as the storms near Hawaii.\xc2\xa0 These are powerful storms with the potential to cause significant damage.\xc2\xa0 So we, as we often do in these circumstances, strongly encourage those in the path of the storms to take appropriate steps to prepare, and to heed the warnings of state and local officials.</p>\n<p>With that, Mr. Lederman, would you like to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 As you know, in Iraq, there is some national concern about some religious minorities that may be trapped there.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House or the U.S. considering any urgent action to help those trapped minorities?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, the United States strongly condemns ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s assault on Sinjar and surrounding areas of northern Iraq. These actions have exacerbated an already dire humanitarian crisis, and the situation is nearing a humanitarian catastrophe. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians are reported to have been displaced, fleeing persecution.\xc2\xa0 And we are gravely concerned for their health and safety, including the vulnerable ethnic and religious minority communities who have been specifically targeted by ISIL.</p>\n<p>The cold and calculated manner in which ISIL has targeted defenseless Iraqis like the Yazidis and Christians solely because of their ethnic and religious identity demonstrates a callous disregard for human rights, and it is deeply disturbing.\xc2\xa0 In particular, we\'re concerned about the welfare of the large community of Iraqi Yazidis who are stranded on Mount Sinjar without food, water or shelter, and the Iraqi Christians who have been forced to flee from their villages in the region.\xc2\xa0 We\'re deeply concerned about reports that ISIL has abducted as many as several hundred girls from these vulnerable communities.</p>\n<p>We\'re working intensively with the government of Iraq, the Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish authorities in the immediate area to support their efforts to address the humanitarian situation in Sinjar.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of what the U.S. might be able to do to stop this, is the President considering things along the lines of humanitarian aid?\xc2\xa0 Might he consider going as far as airstrikes against ISIL to address this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, first and foremost, as I mentioned, Iraqi authorities and Kurdish authorities are focused on this very specific threat to the nation of Iraq and to the vulnerable populations that live in these areas.\xc2\xa0 So the United States government as well as the United States military is supporting the ongoing efforts of the Iraqi officials and Kurdish officials to address this urgent humanitarian crisis that exists. It is a situation that we are deeply concerned about and closely monitoring.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President been meeting with people about this recently?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little bit of detail about how he\xe2\x80\x99s addressing it and whether we may expect to hear anything more from him about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, as he often does, met with his national security team -- or members of his national security team this morning.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific readout of that meeting, but American officials in Iraq and American officials here in the U.S. are closely monitoring this situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that why he was late, by the way?\xc2\xa0 Was that right before the event?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates for the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But go ahead, Josh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other thing.\xc2\xa0 The White House said that the President, in a departure from what had been originally released as his schedule for his trip to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, will come back for a day or so.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about why he\xe2\x80\x99ll be returning?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to take advantage of a little time, not next week but the week after, to do a day or two of in-person meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 This is not in relation to an emergent situation -- that\'s obvious because these meetings are being scheduled a couple weeks in advance.\xc2\xa0 But this is an opportunity for the President to do some in-person meetings here at the White House just for a day or two before he returns to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any detail on who those in-person meetings might be with?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the U.S. is supporting the ongoing efforts of the Iraqi and Kurdish officials on the threats, on the humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 How is the U.S. supporting that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of different ways, Roberta.\xc2\xa0 The first is there is a longstanding military-to-military relationship between the United States and Iraqi security forces, and so there is training and resources and supplies that are regularly provided from the United States military to Iraq security forces.</p>\n<p>As you also know, there are a couple of joint operations centers that have been established in Iraq in the last few weeks, both in Erbil and Baghdad, where close military coordination and cooperation can occur.\xc2\xa0 That includes, again, American military personnel, as well as some Kurdish security forces and some Iraq security forces -- that all of this is integrated in those two places.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The final thing is there are also, as you know, the President announced a few weeks ago, American military personnel who are on the ground in Iraq to provide an assessment of the situation on the ground and an assessment of the capability of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces.\xc2\xa0 And those individuals are obviously working closely with Iraq security forces and Kurdish security forces to evaluate that situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So beyond those things that have already been announced, France today said that it\xe2\x80\x99s ready to take action in addressing that humanitarian situation that you described earlier.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. military considering specific action to support France or support the situation in that way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce from here.\xc2\xa0 American military personnel in Iraq are conducting an assessment at the direction of the President about the capability of Iraqi security forces and the conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0 That sort of assessment is done after and in conjunction with careful coordination and cooperation with Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So if there are specific needs that need to be met in terms of enhancing Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces capability, then we will look to provide it.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a longstanding military-to-military relationship that has existed for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And we can operate through those channels to provide assistance to the Iraqis as they confront this very difficult and tragic situation in their own country.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to get a really straight answer, is the U.S. considering airstrikes among these options to make sure that humanitarian assistance is provided to those oppressed minority populations in northern Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Are airstrikes on the table?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to rule things on the table or off the table in this context.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is to reiterate a principle that the President himself has articulated a couple of times.\xc2\xa0 There are many problems in Iraq. This one that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about right now has a particularly -- is a particularly acute one in that the stakes are very high.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing innocent populations be persecuted just because of their religious or ethnic identity.\xc2\xa0 The humanitarian situation is deeply disturbing there and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we are following closely.</p>\n<p>That said, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for everyone to understand -- and the President has made this clear -- that there are no American military solutions to the problems in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t solve these problems for them.\xc2\xa0 These problems can only be solved with Iraq political solutions.\xc2\xa0 That is the core of our thinking as we confront these kinds of situations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the President has, at the same time, demonstrated his clear willingness to take the kind of military action that\xe2\x80\x99s required to protect core American interests.\xc2\xa0 Those interests include things like protecting American personnel around the globe.\xc2\xa0 He has taken actions like that in other countries.\xc2\xa0 The President has also made clear that American military action in Iraq would not include combat boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 That is a principle that the President laid out at the beginning and that continues to be true today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so it sounds like what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that this is under consideration.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to shed light about the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking at this point.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty clear about the broader problems and the broader challenges that are facing the people of Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 What is clear is that there are no American military solutions to those problems.\xc2\xa0 Those solutions are only going to come about through the kinds of political reforms that only the Iraqis themselves can undertake.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds as though, to deliver this humanitarian aid, something may have to be done militarily to soften ISIL-ISIS in that area so those supplies could go in.\xc2\xa0 Is that a correct read of the situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to provide you a tactical assessment of the situation on the ground.\xc2\xa0 What I can do is I can give you some insight into the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking in general about the kinds of principles that would apply to contemplated military action.\xc2\xa0 That would include no combat boots being put on the ground in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear about that, and that principle continues to hold.\xc2\xa0 The President has also been clear that any sort of military action that would be taken in Iraq would be very limited in scope and very specific to addressing a core American objective.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that principle he laid out earlier this summer, that remains the case now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And that would include things like protecting American personnel or confronting counterterrorism threats.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been also very clear about is that any sort of American military action would have to be closely tied to Iraqi political reforms that are long overdue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the good news on that is that we have seen in recent weeks some steps taken by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to form a government on a timeline that\xe2\x80\x99s much more -- much faster than they\xe2\x80\x99ve made these kinds of decisions in the past.\xc2\xa0 So just in the last couple of weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the election of a new Iraqi president who is a Kurd.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the appointment of a new Iraqi speaker, who is Sunni, and the appointment of two deputy speakers, one of whom is a Kurd and one of whom is Shia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What continues to -- the work that remains to be done in terms of those political reforms is the election of a new Iraqi prime minister and a cohesive government that is committed to leading that country in a way that reflects Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population and gives confidence to the citizens of Iraq that the government is looking out for the interests and well-being of every citizen in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last night, there was a pool report that said that the Chairman of Joint Chiefs was here meeting with the President in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Did this matter come up in their discussions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think the pool report noted that Chairman Dempsey traveled with the President from the State Department at the conclusion of the Africa Leaders Summit back to the White House.\xc2\xa0 They did -- the Chairman did ride in the car with the President on the way back from that meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if they discussed the national security matter --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any readout of their discussion.</p>\n<p>Move around a little bit -- Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you respond to some of the criticism from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats, led by the Chairwoman, Senator Feinstein about the report about -- you know what report -- the interrogation tactics after 9/11?\xc2\xa0 What is the administration doing, and has the President spoken to the Chairwoman yet?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any conversations -- at least I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any to read out to you -- conversations between the President and the Chairwoman.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the Director of National Intelligence indicated on Friday, the report that was declassified by the DNI left 85 percent of that material included in that report unredacted.\xc2\xa0 That is a rather large percentage when you consider the subject matter that\xe2\x80\x99s included in the report.\xc2\xa0 Those redactions are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that those redactions -- about half of those redactions were actually included in the footnotes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the substance of the material that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is largely unredacted.\xc2\xa0 And that reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal commitment and view that this report be released to the public so that the public can see exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it is important, as -- he stood at this podium about a week or so ago and laid out why he believed it was important for this report to be released; that serious mistakes were made, and that it would be inappropriate to stand in sanctimonious judgment of those individuals who were responsible for trying to protect this country at a very difficult, tumultuous time, but yet, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that some of the actions that occurred were wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President spoke out against those actions as a candidate for President.\xc2\xa0 And upon assuming office, within the first week, the President issued the kind of executive action that was necessary to ensure that those actions would never take place in his administration.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that this report is important in that it details what happened in a way that can ensure or at least minimize the likelihood that these kinds of tactics would occur again in the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up.\xc2\xa0 You all think it should be released. They are not releasing it.\xc2\xa0 They want to have a further conversation.\xc2\xa0 Is that conversation taking place?\xc2\xa0 Are you all going to agree to something else?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, after the Chairwoman raised her concerns on Friday afternoon, the Director of National Intelligence issued a statement indicating a willingness to try to cooperate with the committee to resolve their concerns so that this report could be released as soon as possible, in line with the President\xe2\x80\x99s preferences.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re working on that effort, but I don\'t have an update on those conversations to share with you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I saw (inaudible) was here for the dinner the other night.\xc2\xa0 I know a lot of people were here -- they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a conversation at that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they had a conversation, if they had a chance to talk at the dinner.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russia announced today that Edward Snowden would be eligible to stay for an additional three years.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering -- I\'d like to get you guys\xe2\x80\x99 reaction to that, but also if you could talk a little bit about what this means in terms of the effectiveness of sanctions that you guys have already imposed over the situation in Ukraine and their ability to sort of alter President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, and also whether this might mean that you guys are going to move ahead with additional sanctions against Russia.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s important for people to understand -- and I think this has been made crystal-clear to President Putin -- that the sanctions are related to the destabilizing actions that Russia has taken in Ukraine and along the border with Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That includes the illegal annexation of Crimea, [and] the deployment of some troops in a threatening way along the Russia-Ukraine border.\xc2\xa0 It also includes the evidence that we\'ve seen of attacks being launched from the Russian side of the border against Ukrainian military targets.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve also seen the transfer of heavy weapons from the Russian side across the border into Ukraine and into the hands of Russian-backed separatists.\xc2\xa0 All of those actions are what led to the sanctions regime that\'s been put in place by the United States and our allies and partners all around the globe.</p>\n<p>The Snowden situation is a different one.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to Mr. Snowden, our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 He\'s accused of leaking classified information and faces felony charges here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we believe that he should return to the United States as soon as possible, where he\'ll be afforded full due process and protections that are allowed to U.S. citizens under the law.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to get back to Iraq and some terminology here.\xc2\xa0 You said that the President would act for a core American objective and in America\xe2\x80\x99s interests.\xc2\xa0 We\'re now at a situation where you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a series of Christian towns that have been effectively ethnically cleansed, and a situation where religious minorities have been given a choice of a slaughter or leave or convert to Islam.\xc2\xa0 Is preventing a kind of humanitarian catastrophe, which you said appears to be at hand, a core American objective?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are times where the President has taken military action, sometimes in concert with our allies, to protect innocent, vulnerable civilian populations from slaughter or other dire humanitarian situations.\xc2\xa0 That occurred in Libya, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, where Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s army was speeding toward Benghazi, promising to carry out the slaughter of innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 When presented with that information, the President did order military action.</p>\n<p>We evaluate each of these circumstances on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 Each of them is different.\xc2\xa0 Each of them has their own potential consequences and unique set of complications.\xc2\xa0 We have been very clear about how disturbing we find this dire humanitarian situation that exists in Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing Christians being persecuted because of their religious beliefs.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing Yazidis be persecuted because of their religious and ethnic identity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is one particular situation that we are concerned about -- there is a mountain near Sinjar where there are reports that thousands of Yazidis are currently trapped on that mountain and have been for a couple of days now.\xc2\xa0 They are unable to access food and water.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t have any access to shelter.\xc2\xa0 And they have fled persecution, and efforts to leave the mountain are blocked by ISIL forces who are vowing to kill them.\xc2\xa0 This is a terrible humanitarian situation and one that is of great concern to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me just get back to my question then.\xc2\xa0 I understand the historic context with Libya and all, but specifically, preventing ethnic religious cleansing of the type you have just described -- is that a core American interest?\xc2\xa0 Is preventing that kind of slaughter -- ethnic religious-based slaughter in America\xe2\x80\x99s core interest?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is something that we evaluate on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, this kind of -- there have been situations -- again, to go back to history here -- there have been situations where this kind of ethnic slaughter and cleansing can have a very destabilizing impact on a broader region.\xc2\xa0 And that is how -- that is one way in which a humanitarian situation could have broader implications for not just the country where this is occurring, but for other countries in the region or even other countries around the globe.</p>\n<p>So I\'m not in a position to further describe, characterize this situation beyond pointing out how deeply disturbing it is.\xc2\xa0 But it is something that we are closely monitoring.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I believe it\'s been about two months since ISIS took over Mosul.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of talk here about preparations for potential military action, which did not happen.\xc2\xa0 In the interceding two months, ISIS has taken over more territory in Iraq, has taken over more border crossings at the Syria border, has taken over a major oil refinery.\xc2\xa0 It has now taken over the largest dam in Iraq, giving it control over vast areas of electricity.\xc2\xa0 What is the United States doing about this?\xc2\xa0 Where is the American leadership on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important -- again, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for all your viewers to understand this -- that there are no military solutions to the very difficult problems that exist in Iraq now.\xc2\xa0 The American people cannot solve this problem for the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 The only solution that exists is an Iraqi political solution.\xc2\xa0 That was true six weeks ago and it\xe2\x80\x99s true today.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States stands ready to support the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people when an inclusive Iraqi government is formed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Iraqi and Kurdish forces have been overrun quite easily it seems by ISIS.\xc2\xa0 And I understand the point you have made, there is no American military solution.\xc2\xa0 But can the United States tolerate a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda having control over a vast area of Iraq and of Syria and access to resources that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a terrorist group have access to -- oil, financial, military resources?\xc2\xa0 Can we tolerate that? I mean, I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the Iraqis to get their act together, and that may or may not ever happen.\xc2\xa0 But in the meantime, can the U.S. afford to have a terrorist group with control of such resources and territory?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has not demonstrated any sort of unwillingness to act when necessary to counter terror threats that may pose a significant risk to American personnel or American interests or even the American homeland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this such a threat?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer that kind of assessment from here.\xc2\xa0 But this is a situation that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at very closely.\xc2\xa0 This is a situation that American members of the military are on the ground reviewing very closely.\xc2\xa0 What is most important about this situation is that this is a complicated problem that exists right now in Iraq, and if we want to confront this problem, what we need is we need for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to step forward, put in place the kind of reforms that would allow for the creation of an inclusive government that would unify the people of Iraq and unify Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces to confront this threat.</p>\n<p>After all, this is a threat right now that is an existential threat for the people of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States stands ready to support the people of Iraq and an inclusive government of Iraq to defeat this threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to people at the State Department and at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 Both say today serious consideration is being given to one of two things in this particular northern Iraq region -- slow moving U.S. military aircraft dropping food and water to these stranded religious minorities, and/or military support to create a corridor for them to evacuate.\xc2\xa0 Is that true or not true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to discuss those kinds of tactical options from the podium on live television.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President will make the kinds of decisions as necessary to protect core American --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he being apprised of these options?\xc2\xa0 Is he at least -- can you tell us he\xe2\x80\x99s at least considering what to do?\xc2\xa0 Because the conversations we\xe2\x80\x99re having is that this is not just a potentially dire humanitarian crisis, it\xe2\x80\x99s an hour-by-hour situation that\'s going to need some kind of resolution or some kind of decision very, very soon.\xc2\xa0 So can you at least tell us the President has been briefed on these specific options and he\xe2\x80\x99s weighing them now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to provide a great deal of insight into any sort of the decisions the President may or may not be contemplating at this point.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say the President is keenly aware of the dire humanitarian situation that exists.\xc2\xa0 The President, as I mentioned earlier, has been in touch with his national security team this morning here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President is aware of the kinds of assessments that are being made by American military personnel who are on the ground and staffing these joint operation centers, both in Erbil and Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 Those American military personnel are closely interfacing with Kurdish security forces and Iraq security forces.\xc2\xa0 The United States military has provided a great deal of support to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces over the years, but also recently, to try to help them confront this threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>So the President is very well-aware of exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President and the rest of his team are very concerned about the dire humanitarian situation that exists in the short term -- or I guess I should say in the immediate term.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re also very concerned about Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s capability to deal with the longer-term problems that we see there.\xc2\xa0 And that concern rests on an important principle, which is that there is no American military solution to that problem, but rather Iraqi political solutions and decisions that will be required.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you at least concede what appears to be the obvious, that these consultations and this decision, whatever it comes down to, is going to have to be made separate of the U.S. desire for a unified, inclusive government in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Because even if there was one, that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to bring water and food to 40,000 people stranded on a mountain surrounded by ISIL -- that that decision, whatever you -- I mean, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything to those people.\xc2\xa0 It could be a unified, non -- or a unified Iraqi government tomorrow, and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give them any help.\xc2\xa0 Someone is going to have to help these people.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to concede that the decision of whether or not this government is going to help them or not is utterly separate from whatever political calculations are made in Baghdad.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start -- I think I slightly disagree with the premise of your question, because I think that the dire humanitarian situation that exists on Sinjar Mountain is a consequence of a broader failure by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that would unite that country to confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to separate these two things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s cold comfort to people who need shelter and water right now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a theoretical point, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t care.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a theoretical point because it is -- this helps uncover why it is so important that we address the root of this problem.\xc2\xa0 And the root of this problem is that we have not seen an inclusive Iraq government that has unified the country.\xc2\xa0 We have not seen an integrated Iraq security forces that is capable of confronting a threat as dangerous as ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the United States military work closely with Iraq security forces to provide what\xc2\xa0 -- to try to provide support.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President and the Vice President spend a lot of time working to encourage Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to pursue this kind of inclusive governing agenda.</p>\n<p>That ultimately -- if we want to prevent these urgent humanitarian situations from occurring in the first place, we need to move the Iraqi people -- and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders, most importantly -- in the direction of confronting the root cause of all of this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, I began my remarks today in answering Josh\xe2\x80\x99s first question by highlighting how seriously concerned we are about this urgent humanitarian situation that exists in this region.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing Christians be persecuted.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing these other religious and ethnic minorities be persecuted just because of their identities.\xc2\xa0 That is barbaric.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting. And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re deeply concerned about and very closely monitoring.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, if you say the Iraqi government is in as bad a shape as you lay out, aren\xe2\x80\x99t these ethnic minorities crying out for American leadership, leadership from America and its allies right now?\xc2\xa0 Because the Iraqi government in the short term can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen some important steps from the Iraqi government that -- we have seen the appointment of a new Kurdish president and an Iraqi speaker who is Sunni.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, long term, medium term.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying you\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing the Iraqi government in Baghdad, the central government, have the ability to go in and get people food and water.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen efforts that have been undertaken by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces and Kurdish security forces to try to address this situation.\xc2\xa0 They have not been successful so far.\xc2\xa0 But the United States is acting in support of those security forces in those efforts because we are concerned about this dire humanitarian situation.</p>\n<p>But I do want to point out, Ed, that the failure of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political system early on is what led to this situation where we saw ISIL make such significant gains on the ground, and we saw that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of capability to withstand that assault because they were not integrated with the rest of the population.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so there are two things at play here.\xc2\xa0 We want to try to address the root causes of this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on political reform.\xc2\xa0 That is ultimately what\xe2\x80\x99s going to address the broader problems and the broader challenges that Iraq is facing right now.\xc2\xa0 But we do have this dire humanitarian situation that\xe2\x80\x99s underway, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re making a fair point that there\xe2\x80\x99s bigger problems in Iraq, you can\xe2\x80\x99t solve those.\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 But it seems like a disconnect that you\xe2\x80\x99re laying out yourself from the podium that there\xe2\x80\x99s about to be a possible genocide of 40,000 people and you\xe2\x80\x99re saying we\xe2\x80\x99re seriously concerned, we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring it.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that seem like a disconnect?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, Ed, because this is something that we are closely watching, and it is something that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But closely watching -- people might be slaughtered.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is we are actively supporting the Iraq security forces and Kurdish security forces to try to confront this problem both in the short term, but also working closely with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership so that we can address the root cause of this over the long term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last one on this.\xc2\xa0 I think it was in answer to Jon, when asked about America\xe2\x80\x99s core interests, you were saying we decide these on a case-to-case basis, case by case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think he was asking about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Core interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, he was asking about specific humanitarian situations.\xc2\xa0 And we evaluate on a case-by-case basis what implications those humanitarian situations have on core American national security interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to put a finer point on it, perhaps, is preventing a genocide in America\xe2\x80\x99s core interests?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that that is an important question is that we have seen a couple of different situations where there have been urgent conditions where innocent civilians were under extreme duress and at a heightened risk of slaughter, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the answer?\xc2\xa0 Is preventing genocide in America\xe2\x80\x99s core interests?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty basic question.\xc2\xa0 Is preventing genocide in America\xe2\x80\x99s core interests?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, and what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is that each of these instances is evaluated on a case-by-case basis in terms of what the United States of America can do to influence those situations.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the United States has been and will continue to be a beacon of freedom and respect for basic human rights around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And that is a core founding principle of this country, and it is one that American men and women have fought and died to protect.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to be -- stand up for that value.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I remember the President putting out a very emotional statement, I believe it was April, the anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda.\xc2\xa0 Just a few months ago, he put out a big statement about how we can\xe2\x80\x99t let this happen again.\xc2\xa0 And here, we\xe2\x80\x99re confronting the possibility of 40,000 people facing genocide and I\xe2\x80\x99m still not hearing -- is preventing genocide in America\xe2\x80\x99s core interests?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I am saying is that each of these situations is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 The principle of basic respect for human rights and the protection of communities that are threatened only because of their religious or ethnic identity is something that the United States cannot abide.\xc2\xa0 The question is what and how the United States can intervene to mitigate that situation.\xc2\xa0 And those kinds of decisions are the kinds of decisions that are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question on -- yesterday, the President at his news conference on another subject was asked about political prisoners and freedom of press, but also trying to free political prisoners in particular.\xc2\xa0 And next week, we\xe2\x80\x99re coming up on the anniversary of two different Americans who have been held for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Warren Weinstein is in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 He is an American contractor, I believe, who was working with USAID.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got a heart condition.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen pictures of him.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been in terrible shape.\xc2\xa0 And Austin Tice, who was an award-winning journalist trying to cover the war in Syria, has also been a captive.\xc2\xa0 The anniversary of both of them being kidnapped is coming up next week.\xc2\xa0 Is this on the radar?\xc2\xa0 The President talked yesterday about how important it is to try to free these kinds of folks who were held for so long.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 These kinds of situations are on the radar of the American foreign policy and national security apparatus here in the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President on a regular basis is updated on.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to spend a great deal of time and effort and resources to safely recover or ensure the return of those American citizens who are being held hostage around the globe.\xc2\xa0 That is something on which the President\xe2\x80\x99s advisors spend a lot of time, and it continues to be a high priority, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, also yesterday, during the press conference, the President was asked if he would consider sending lethal aid to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And he said that we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet, that essentially if you start seeing an invasion by Russia, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a different set of questions.\xc2\xa0 Given that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Russian troop buildup almost double in the past week, what does the President need to see happen before he starts to consider sending lethal aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that we are concerned about the buildup of Russian troops on the border.\xc2\xa0 Those forces are serving to facilitate the transfer of arms, materiel, and fighters across the border, as well as provide training to separatists.\xc2\xa0 The buildup of these forces and the exercises they are supposedly there to support also represent Russian attempts to intimidate Ukraine.</p>\n<p>As the President said directly to President Putin in a phone call six days ago, the United States would like to see this crisis resolved diplomatically, but we are concerned about the ongoing troop buildup on the Russian side of the border, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s continuing support for the separatists, and we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned that Russian forces appear to continue shelling Ukrainian positions from inside Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that we are concerned about Russian statements indicating that they may send what they described as \xe2\x80\x9cpeacekeepers\xe2\x80\x9d to help secure the crash site.\xc2\xa0 Russia has a track record of abusing the term \xe2\x80\x9cpeacekeeping\xe2\x80\x9d as a cover for unlawful military intervention and occupation.\xc2\xa0 Given its unlawful attempted annexation of Crimea, which I mentioned earlier, it is deeply troubling to hear any discussion of Russian \xe2\x80\x9cpeacekeepers\xe2\x80\x9d being sent to Ukrainian territory.\xc2\xa0 These statements are destabilizing and unhelpful.\xc2\xa0 And Russia should anticipate that any such move would be met with condemnation and result in further economic cost and political isolation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you talk about the concerns, is it accurate to say that sending lethal aid is something that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table that he would consider?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President acknowledged yesterday that there are wide-ranging discussions that the United States has engaged with --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that yes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- the Ukrainians, political leadership and with their military leadership.\xc2\xa0 And so we certainly value that relationship, and the United States I think has demonstrated pretty clearly our support for the Ukrainian people as they confront the destabilizing activities of Russia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more on immigration.\xc2\xa0 The President seemed to signal yesterday that he is considering extending work permits to those who are here illegally.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify his comments?\xc2\xa0 He said that he was going to have to make choices on how to allocate resources.\xc2\xa0 What specifically does that mean?\xc2\xa0 And I guess bottom line, can we expect him to announce that more people will be granted work permits to stay here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President was talking about, in terms of the deployment of resources, he was referring to Congress failing to act to ensure that the federal government has the necessary resources to deal with the situation at the border.\xc2\xa0 This administration, four or five weeks ago now, laid out a very specific plan, a list, if you will, of specific line items indicating the resources that are necessary to deal with the problem of unaccompanied children and adults who are traveling with children who are apprehended at the border attempting to illegally enter this country.\xc2\xa0 Congress left for their five-week August recess without acting on that request.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it means that this government and this administration will have to confront that situation without all of the resources that we would like to deal with this challenge.\xc2\xa0 So what that means is, it means that the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of HHS, even the Department of Defense will have to evaluate what resources are on hand and can be used and deployed to address this specific situation.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen steps taken by HHS and DHS to announce the reprogramming of funds.\xc2\xa0 This means that they will take money, resources that are currently being used in other areas and directing them to confront the situation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at the border.\xc2\xa0 Those are difficult choices.\xc2\xa0 That money was originally targeted toward things that would -- that could be described as priorities, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be diverted to confront this urgent priority simply because Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t do their job.</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of actions that have to be considered by the executive branch when the legislative branch utterly fails to fulfill their basic responsibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just -- but going back to the initial part of the question, is he leaning towards granting work permits to those who are here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said that he is leaning toward considering is the array of options that are available to him under the law for trying to fix some of the problems created by a broken immigration system that House Republicans have stymied, if you will.</p>\n<p>There is a common-sense proposal that was passed on a bipartisan basis in the Senate that House Republicans are continuing to block.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has said is, he said, let me consider and let me have my Attorney General and my Secretary of Homeland Security consider what options are available to me under the law to try to address some of these problems that Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t even attempt to solve.</p>\n<p>And in terms of what those options are, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about them here because, frankly, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are still in the midst of a review to determine what options are available in the first place.\xc2\xa0 Once that review has been concluded and they have identified some available options, then we can talk about which options the President may be considering.</p>\n<p>Steven.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the words, \xe2\x80\x9cnew Iraqi prime minister\xe2\x80\x9d earlier, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the United States would like to see Maliki go.\xc2\xa0 Given all the problems that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with his ability to unify that country, does that country need a new prime minister?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It sounds like I may have been using some imprecise language earlier, before.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of decisions about who should be prime minister of the nation of Iraq will be made solely by the people of Iraq and by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders.\xc2\xa0 So it is not the position of the United States that one person or another should be the prime minister of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Rather, what we have said is that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders should choose a prime minister that will pursue a governing agenda that is inclusive of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.\xc2\xa0 So we have not weighed in or endorsed a candidate, if you will.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separately, on Afghanistan, Speaker Boehner issued a statement after Harold Greene\xe2\x80\x99s death, saying that the President should reassess, essentially, his strategy for withdrawing from Afghanistan, and that if he does the Speaker will have his back. And his big concern is that Afghanistan will go the way of Iraq, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave too soon.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this attack changes the President\xe2\x80\x99s calculus on Afghanistan at all.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Steven, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me describe the attack as one that we were saddened by.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the thoughts and prayers of the President and First Lady and everybody here at the White House go out to the family of the General, of General Greene, who was killed in that attack.\xc2\xa0 Our thoughts and prayers are with those soldiers who were wounded in that attack and are currently recuperating and -- in the same way that our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all of those who have been killed in Afghanistan throughout that prolonged military conflict there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to a strategy in Afghanistan that he laid out in May is unchanged; that we have laid out very clearly that at the end of this year, the presence of American military forces will have been reduced, and they will be on a steady decline over the two years after.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What, however, is required is for the new President of Afghanistan, when one has been selected, for them to sign on to a bilateral security agreement that was brokered over the course of a year and has basically been sitting on the desk of the Afghan President for a number of months now.\xc2\xa0 But upon the signing of that bilateral security agreement, we can execute a strategy that the President has laid out that will draw down American troops, that will wind down our role in that conflict but in a way that continues to support the Afghan people as they take responsibility for their own security and as they stand up for the kinds of civil institutions that are necessary to govern that country.</p>\n<p>We will also have in place, at least for the next couple of years under this strategy, forces who could conduct counterterrorism operations as necessary; if we detect that there are terrorists that are using Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks either against the Afghan people or anywhere around the world, that we\xe2\x80\x99d be in a position to support the Afghan security forces as they confront those terrorists.</p>\n<p>So the President has a sound strategy that we believe reflects the best interests of the Afghan people, but also will ensure for the protection of core American national security interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you get a lot of questions before the President goes out of town about his capabilities.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t confirmed the launch of airstrikes or humanitarian aid, but can you confirm for us that the President, when he\xe2\x80\x99s on Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, will have the ability to launch, monitor, and command anything, including airstrikes or humanitarian aid to the northern area of Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say, as a general matter, that whenever the President travels anywhere -- and this will be true when the President travels to Massachusetts at the end of this week -- that he travels with an array of communications equipment and national security advisors that will allow him to perform all of the functions that are required of America\xe2\x80\x99s Commander-In-Chief.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true of any trip that he takes, and it will be true of the trip that the President takes this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President were to launch a military strike against any country, including Iraq, would he feel it would be appropriate to do it from Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, or would he return to Washington?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just a hypothetical that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think would be appropriate for me to engage in this setting on this particular day.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say who President Obama would be meeting with when he returns during the middle of his Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard trip.\xc2\xa0 Can you say what the subjects of those meetings might be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t at this point, but you can check back next week and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can provide you some additional insight into those meetings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he just want to meet with somebody?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Presumably if he just wanted to meet with somebody he could probably find people in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard who would meet with him.\xc2\xa0 But this is an opportunity for the President to meet with some of his White House staff who will be remaining in Washington, and it will be an opportunity for him to consult with them in person.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it address or reflect a sensitivity about the optics of a two-week vacation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does not.\xc2\xa0 There have been questions raised by some of our critics about the optics of two- and three-day travel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- that the President\xe2\x80\x99s engaged in.\xc2\xa0 The President recognizes that he is President of the United States 24 hours a day, seven days a week, wherever he happens to be.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be in a position to fulfill the core functions of the Commander-in-Chief and ensure for the safety and security of the American people wherever he travels.\xc2\xa0 That will be true when he travels at the end of this week.\xc2\xa0 That will be true for the entirety of his time that he is in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 On the immigration situation, because in mid-September the President is going to be and the administration will be thinking about a continuing resolution and funding after the end of the fiscal year, to what extent does the CR negotiations open up an opportunity to try to build in more money for the border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately, discussions around a continuing resolution will be driven by congressional preferences.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, it is their responsibility to determine what should be included in those budgets.\xc2\xa0 The need for additional resources to confront the challenges at the border will remain.\xc2\xa0 They will be here when Congress returns from their five-week August recess.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to be encouraging them to take the kinds of steps that are within the basic responsibilities of the United States Congress to ensure that the federal government has the necessary resources to deal with priorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in this case, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a rather urgent priority as it relates to the situation in one sector of the southwest border with Mexico.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq, I wanted to follow up to what Jon and others were asking you.\xc2\xa0 Because the humanitarian or genocide situation is of international concern, can you say whether the President or his advisors have been reaching out to heads of state or countries beyond the Iraq government to discuss what\xe2\x80\x99s the appropriate thing to do?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific calls from the President to read out.\xc2\xa0 We are working closely with humanitarian organizations, including those organizations that are affiliated with the United Nations, NGOs, and other local and international humanitarian partners to meet the most pressing needs of affected populations in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That includes providing shelter, food and water, blankets and basic medicine.</p>\n<p>The international community is poised to do whatever is possible to come to the assistance of vulnerable Iraqis in dire need of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that is an effort that is being closely coordinated with U.S. efforts to try to meet the needs of these populations that are under siege by terrorists right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And U.S. military action, the President would inform Congress before that was embarked upon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 From the very first time that the President spoke publicly about the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed to Iraq by ISIL, the President committed to closely consulting with Congress and those consultations continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other quick follow-up to what Anita asked.\xc2\xa0 Because information derived from torture or coercion is not admissible in military commissions, to what extent is the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive summary of the report pending in the Senate undermine or in any way affect ongoing military commissions or trials?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the executive summary is something that was written by the committee themselves --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, his executive summary was we \xe2\x80\x9ctortured some folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments about this -- about the report?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, the conclusion.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to give you an assessment of what impact that may have on that broader policy,\xc2\xa0 but I will see if I can get somebody who is better versed in that issue and could give you an update of whether or not the release of that report would have an impact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I understand some things that you said when talking about Iraq during --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said a lot today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you said a lot, so let\xe2\x80\x99s go over a few things.\xc2\xa0 You said that military action would be dependent upon an inclusive government.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I said -- and this is a principle that the President has laid out --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he met all those criteria, you mentioned earlier, it still is dependent on an inclusive government.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try to clarify that because I think that is in need of some clarification.\xc2\xa0 The President has not been shy about his willingness to use the might of the American military to protect core American national security interests.\xc2\xa0 That\'s true in Iraq; that\'s true in countries all around the globe.\xc2\xa0 Those priorities include things like ensuring for the protection of American personnel.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there is American military and diplomatic personnel in Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that -- their safety is something that we are very carefully monitoring.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also talked about -- and it has been even the source of some controversy -- is the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to use American military might to disrupt the planning of terrorist organizations that have designs on attacking either the American homeland or American interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 That is another instance where the President has deployed and made a decision to commit to military action to provide for the protection of core American national security interests.</p>\n<p>Now, as it relates to decisions about military action in Iraq, what the President has said is, sort of setting aside examples like counterterrorism or the security of American personnel -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 This goes back to -- this is the other principle I was articulating, which is that there are a lot of challenges in Iraq, but those challenges cannot be solved just through the American military.\xc2\xa0 Those solutions only exist through the reform of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political system.</p>\n<p>So there are some in Iraq and even other places around the globe who have called for more robust American military intervention in Iraq to deal with some of these underlying problems.\xc2\xa0 And the concern that the President has is ensuring that any sort of military action in support of the Iraqi government is coordinated with the kinds of reforms that are necessary to address this root problem that we see in Iraq.</p>\n<p>And we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a situation -- I think the President has articulated this as well -- where you essentially have an Iraqi government that is relying solely on American military might to remain in power.\xc2\xa0 The way that the Iraqi government should be able to build up their power is by inspiring the confidence of the people that they were elected to lead.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to see a government that has an inclusive governing agenda that inspires the confidence of the population that the government has their best interests in mind and can unite the country to face some of the difficult threats that they face right now including the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>Is that clarifying?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It does help, actually, because you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- so the American -- the core American interest would be stability in the region, and you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be addressed without an inclusive government -- I\xe2\x80\x99m analyzing this, I understand.\xc2\xa0 You\'re not saying that directly.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I want to reconcile that against the idea, too, that you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- you said we have seen some steps towards inclusive government.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we have not yet seen an inclusive government, which makes me wonder how far, like, in terms of days or weeks, how far away do you think, in the best-case scenario, the Iraqi government is from being where you want them to be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, some of that is because they have not yet formed the -- they have not formed a new Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 They had elections a few months ago and that sort of resulted in a process that allowed for the election of a new president, a new speaker, a couple of deputy speakers that do reflect the diversity of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s population.\xc2\xa0 That is evidence of some progress.</p>\n<p>But we have not yet seen the appointment of a prime minister. \xc2\xa0And once that prime minister is in place, there will then be a fully formed government that can then pursue a governing agenda, we hope -- what we would like is for them to pursue a governing agenda that reflects the best interests of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at is by whatever criteria you\xe2\x80\x99re operating, is this -- are we days or weeks away from achieving that point where you have -- where it has met the President\xe2\x80\x99s threshold?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell because ultimately this is a decision -- again, the decision about who will be the next prime minister is a decision that the Iraqi people and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders will have to make.\xc2\xa0 Once that decision is made, then we will evaluate the kind of governing agenda that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s government pursues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me just ask this one other question.\xc2\xa0 Dropping humanitarian aid on that mountain is not a military action in the sense that you\xe2\x80\x99re defining it today -- defining military action today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the American military has some unique capabilities and unique assets.\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m primarily referring to is the kind of kinetic military action that would involve the firing of weapons, taking out targets, and other sort of military action that would be coordinated with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces to try to beat back the advance of ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I want to clarify one point coming off of what Christi said.\xc2\xa0 The President has also articulated one other rationale for the use of American military force, which he did in Libya, which is to avert an imminent humanitarian catastrophe when U.S. action, on a limited basis, could achieve that goal.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how he justified the NATO bombing campaign.\xc2\xa0 Does the humanitarian circumstance you\xe2\x80\x99re describing on that mountaintop meet that definition?\xc2\xa0 Can the U.S. avert it?\xc2\xa0 And is it an imminent humanitarian catastrophe?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right, Mark, that is an example that I raised even in answering Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question of a specific situation where the President did conclude that acting to avert a humanitarian disaster was in the national security interest of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 The point that I tried to make to Jon is that each of those situations is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and they\xe2\x80\x99re evaluated both for their impact on core American national security, they\xe2\x80\x99re also evaluated for what sort of impact could American action have on that situation.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re also evaluated based on what are the potential consequences of taking an action.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why each of these situations is considered on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to describe to you any conclusions that have been reached by the President or anybody else in the administration about the national security implications for the United States of this specific humanitarian situation other than to say it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we condemn and are very concerned about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But were you to make that conclusion, all of this discussion we\xe2\x80\x99ve had about the need for political transition -- none of that would pertain because the President\xe2\x80\x99s rationale in the Libya case didn\xe2\x80\x99t hinge on the political process, it hinged purely on averting a humanitarian catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 Correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is correct, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that there are different reasons that military action could be ordered.\xc2\xa0 So one would be to, as the example in Benghazi, was to avert a humanitarian disaster.\xc2\xa0 There have also been situations where the President has ordered military action to protect American personnel and assets.\xc2\xa0 There have been other situations where the President has ordered military action to disrupt terror plots.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are also situations -- and this is what is being contemplated by some -- is that the President would order military action to beat back the advance of ISIL in order to shore up Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been clear that he is unwilling to commit to that kind of military action without a corresponding effort on the part of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to pursue the kinds of reforms that are necessary to inspire the confidence in that government of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:02 P.M.
