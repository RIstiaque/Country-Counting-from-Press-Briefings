MDT</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  Q\xc2\xa0Start with something easy like Burma.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Burma?\xc2\xa0 What do you want to know about Burma?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0What\'s your reaction?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we gave a few of you all a statement earlier.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to go past that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen the reports; we\'re monitoring the situation and hopeful of the release, and we\'ll have more to say about it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Did you all know -- I mean, did you all coordinate with him ahead of time?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not going to get into details right now.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this was something that he did independently.\xc2\xa0 As we talked about on Friday, he was briefed before he left by the State Department.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Has the President spoken to Senator Webb today?\xc2\xa0 You haven\'t?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0But you are hopeful for his release?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re hopeful for the American citizen\'s release, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Have you got confirmation he\'s actually been released at this stage?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I read the news reports, that won\'t happen until sometime later on Sunday their time.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0So what do you think you\'ve accomplished this trip on health care reform?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think these are excellent opportunities to talk to people about what is involved in health care reform and what isn\xe2\x80\x99t involved in health care reform.\xc2\xa0 I think the President addressed both of those subjects today and in the Montana town hall meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve proved we can have a civil town hall meeting.\xc2\xa0 I\'d point out that Grand Junction is a place where we got about 35 percent of the vote out of 100, so it\'s not exactly Austin, Texas.\xc2\xa0 So I think it proves that people want to have a genuine discussion about the issues.\xc2\xa0 I know the President was happy with both events and felt like it gave him an opportunity to talk about what\'s at stake.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0It seemed like, when the President invoked his grandmother\'s story at this past town hall, that he really sort of matched the emotion more than he had previously in some of the protesters that we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about that approach, that strategy?\xc2\xa0 Why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he come out with that kind of emotion earlier?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- look, obviously there has been a tremendous amount of misinformation.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure some of it is logically explained.\xc2\xa0 I think some of it is, as I\'ve said many times before, perpetuated on purpose despite the fact that people know the truth by people who ought to be smarter than that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the President invoked the image because, as he said in the answer, it\'s ludicrous to think somebody who had struggled with losing a grandparent, one that meant so much to his development and upbringing, only a day before -- only hours before he\'s elected President -- the notion that he would then go around proposing something as has been discussed by people who know better is crazy.\xc2\xa0 So I think it gave him another opportunity to discuss it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Can we expect to see the President on the road even more in September pushing health care?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\'ll spend a decent amount of time on the road, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Looking towards the VFW speech on Monday, how much of a component of this speech will the Afghan strategy be?\xc2\xa0 It seems that -- will he be talking to this group about the drawing down of Iraq troops and increasing U.S. presence in --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\'s certainly going to talk about the commitments that the men and women of our Armed Forces have made in Iraq and Afghanistan, their contributions to the betterment of those two countries.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll obviously touch on what we\'re accomplishing, what we hope to get out -- what we hope to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 He won\'t get into specifics beyond the -- as you know, General McChrystal is working on a plan that will be sent to the President after the elections that, as Secretary Gates said, will not include troop adjustments in that report.\xc2\xa0 But he\'ll talk about where we are currently in both those two conflicts.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about what we owe the men and women in uniform, and talk about the choices that we\'ve had to make over the past few months about precious resources in our budget and whether or not we\'re going to fund expensive weapons programs the Pentagon says we don\'t need, or give our men and women fighting in those two dangerous places in the world and other places the resources they need.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0On Afghanistan, will he be talking about the strategy overall, whether it\'s working or not, whether -- what you see going forward?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect the President is going to lay out a detailed sort of where we are in Afghanistan, but certainly a little bit -- a less technical update on what\'s happening.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Will he talk about the election there this coming week, or will he just want to stay clear of that to not seem to be interfering?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The latest draft I saw did not have him getting a ton into that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\'s something that we and the rest of the world are watching and will watch.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Did you guys put anything out today on the blast right outside the -- why am I blanking here --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On the embassies --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0-- right, the embassies and NATO?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the President is aware of the situation.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think, as many of our folks have said -- General McChrystal and others have said -- and you\'ve seen what the Taliban has said -- they want very much to disrupt the first election that will be conducted by the Afghan people.\xc2\xa0 And we will -- obviously we\'ve got tremendous resources there to ensure that there\'s a security situation that allows the Afghans to choose their leaders and we hope and expect to see a good, free and fair election and one that hopefully comes off without violence and bloodshed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0On Monday -- can you give us a week-ahead before he goes on vacation?\xc2\xa0 What\'s he got planned next week?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we did a little on Friday.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll do some of this off the top of my head.\xc2\xa0 Tuesday I believe Mubarak is in town from Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Wednesday is the rescheduled NASCAR event.\xc2\xa0 Thursday he\'s at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And at some point on Friday he\'ll leave to go to Camp David.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0On a lighter note, how do you think Obama is doing in terms of being kind of an outdoorsy guy this weekend?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know he had a tremendous amount of fun at Yellow Stone.\xc2\xa0 You know, Governor Schweitzer from Montana had told him he\'ll never -- he said, you\'ll never forget the look on your girls\' face when they see Old Faithful go off.\xc2\xa0 And so I think he was looking forward to that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously -- we were talking about this on the drive back -- and he remembers coming -- when he was 11, his first trip to the mainland, they went to -- his family went to Yellow Stone, they went to the Grand Canyon.\xc2\xa0 So in a number of ways, I think he wants very much to see and share the outdoors and some of the beautiful places in the country with his daughters.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Was Maya there also?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume she was, but I will ask that specifically.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0He told Letterman last September that she was there and so was his grandmother and his mother.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0It\'s been interesting to me to watch him, not being from the great American West, and how much time he\'s been spending at Camp David -- do you think the family in general has developed more of an appreciation for -- I don\'t know -- the outdoors way of life, hiking?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think he\'s always tremendously enjoyed being outside with his family.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can remember him telling stories about -- during the campaign and in the months before the campaign, the summer before the campaign, one of the things he said he would miss the most was riding up and down Lake Shore with his girls on their bikes.\xc2\xa0 Look, he was dying to come here and go fishing.\xc2\xa0 Literally, we -- every time we\'d been to Montana -- the primary, the general election -- every time we went he said, I\'m going to come back here and learn how to fly fish.\xc2\xa0 He was dying to do that, and finally got a chance to do that, though was a bit frustrated he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to hold one of the fish.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Our driver from Montana said the Montanans consider Yellow Stone part of Montana.\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to wade into this controversy?\xc2\xa0 Is it in Wyoming or is it in Montana?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, best I can read the map, there appears to be parts in both states, as well as, from what I can see, some of Idaho.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0What is he doing at the Grand Canyon tomorrow -- any special endeavors?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re going to go for a little bit of a hike.\xc2\xa0 I think the girls are going to do some stuff with the rangers, so they\'ll get a chance to go outside and -- I know he\'s excited about showing them the park.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll get you a little bit more of a download on what specific activities they\'ll do.\xc2\xa0 And I know, as I said -- I think maybe Katie told you all -- Michelle and the girls picked the peaches while we were at the town hall.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0So did they end up going whitewater rafting, or not?\xc2\xa0 Because there was some --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They did.\xc2\xa0 They did.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Okay, so that was what the press saw when they went down?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes -- I guess there was some rumor that the President had been whitewater rafting, but, no, he did not go.\xc2\xa0 But they went for about an hour and a half yesterday and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0In the rain?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, in the rain.\xc2\xa0 The rain and, I\'m told, in the hail.\xc2\xa0 I\'m told there was hail on the helmets as well.\xc2\xa0 But they had a blast.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Do you know what his plans are tonight?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re going out to -- they\'re probably going to go out to dinner with the family.\xc2\xa0 But other than that I don\'t know.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0On the grounds of the hotel?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All of a sudden, I\'m seeing facial expressions change.\xc2\xa0 I think that has very little to do with his enjoyment of the outdoors.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that is an integral part of the pool report.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0There\'s a great restaurant in there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No reason to leave.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this is the same place we stayed on the book tour a few years ago, which was -- it\'s a nice place.\xc2\xa0 But I will check on exactly where they think they\'re going to go to dinner.\xc2\xa0<br/>  \xc2\xa0<br/>  Q\xc2\xa0And if there is a motorcade necessity.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 I think I\'m on to where you\'re going with this stuff.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Just wonder for logistical reasons.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Tomorrow do we actually expect another camera spray of some sort?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\'s the plan, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Anything else we should be expecting or watching for tomorrow in terms of news developing, or is this truly a family day?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Almost entirely a family day.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously if something were to require it we\'ll do it, but I think he\'s looking forward to spending some time outside with the girls.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0What\'s the message we\'re going to hear from your surrogates on the morning shows tomorrow?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\'m one of them so --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0Oh, really?\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t even look at the list.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll spend most of our time talking about health care and the economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0It was interesting, both Valerie and Podesta have made a comment recently in which they said they thought that the ultimate product was going to -- I believe this is what they said -- it was going to end up being more centrist than to the left in terms of the legislation that would come out.\xc2\xa0 I might be misinterpreting that, but the implication was that it was going to appeal to the moderate -- the more middle of America position on health care.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the comments, I don\'t know what John or Valerie said.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you\'re going to get a health care plan that -- well, as the President said today, you start with about 80 percent of agreement on what\'s going on in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the plan that went through Energy and Commerce on the House side did so after quite a bit of negotiating and bargaining with Blue Dog Democrats on Capitol Hill, and we\'re -- I know the President spent some time with Senator Baucus yesterday talking about seeing if the Finance Committee can also get an agreement before the 15th of September.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 I will find out the logistical question on your dinner.\xc2\xa0 Hold, please.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  6:54 P.M.
