Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:40 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us for a slightly early White House briefing.\xc2\xa0 I hope that you\xe2\x80\x99ve all been able to stay dry in the midst of the wet weather outside.</p>\n<p>As you can see, joining me is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top economist, Jason Furman.\xc2\xa0 As you know, on nearly every economic measure, our economy is stronger today than it was the day that President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 Even when it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t popular, the President took steps, like rescuing the auto industry, instituting strict new rules for Wall Street, and passing the Recovery Act to lay the foundation for a more durable economy.</p>\n<p>Now, 2014 was a milestone for economic progress in the United States, but there\xe2\x80\x99s much more work to do.\xc2\xa0 This year, America\xe2\x80\x99s businesses added jobs at the fastest rate since the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 The most interesting statistic I\'ve seen on this is that we\'ve now had 10 consecutive months of more than 200,000 job created in the private sector in each of those months.\xc2\xa0 That is the longest streak in nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 And while many of these good, full-time, middle-class jobs and wages have begun to rise, it\'s still too hard for many middle-class families to get ahead. And while gas prices have fallen as we\'ve produced more oil, and the growth of health care costs has slowed as the Affordable Care Act has been implemented, it\'s still too hard for many middle-class families to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>So our task now that we\'ve recovered from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression is to build on the momentum of the last six years so the economy grows, jobs grow, and wages grow.\xc2\xa0 Our work will not be done until the middle class is thriving and anyone who works hard and plays by the rules has a fair shot.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, with that, let me turn it over to Dr. Furman to give us sort of a little overview, and then he\'ll stick around and take a few questions.</p>\n<p>So, Jason.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. economic recovery took a major step forward in 2014.\xc2\xa0 This is the year in which we broke the record for the longest streak of private sector job growth, now 57 consecutive months and counting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you see in the first slide here, the pace of job growth has picked up every single year in the economic recovery, going from 194,000 jobs per month in 2013 to a pace that is currently 241,000 jobs per month on average for this year.\xc2\xa0 As a result, in just 11 months of the year, we\'ve exceeded any full calendar year of job growth since 1999.\xc2\xa0 That\'s also true on a percentage increase basis.</p>\n<p>This job growth brought the unemployment rate down below 6 percent.\xc2\xa0 The decline in the unemployment rate was nearly the largest in 30 years.\xc2\xa0 And if you step back, it\'s really remarkable -- as recently as 2013, if you asked economists, how long would it take to get the unemployment rate below 6 percent, they would have told you not until 2017.\xc2\xa0 It happened three years ahead of what was broadly expected.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it\'s important to understand that this improving economy is true if you look at some of the underlying numbers in the labor markets and what labor markets are actually doing for workers.\xc2\xa0 The participation rate has stabilized over the past year.\xc2\xa0 The broader measures of unemployment and underemployment have fallen by even more than the unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 A disproportionate fraction of the fall in the unemployment rate is long-term unemployment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we see in the next slide, the job creation has entirely been full-time jobs over the course of the recovery.\xc2\xa0 There are still more people working part-time; we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see that coming down.\xc2\xa0 But the recovery has been moving that very strongly in the right direction.</p>\n<p>You see it in the quality of jobs, which you see in the next slide here.\xc2\xa0 Some of the biggest pickup in job growth has been in areas like manufacturing, construction, information technology, which are among the higher-wage sectors in the economy.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s only three industries that saw slower job growth in 2014 than they saw in the previous year -- they still saw job growth, but slower job growth -- and those also happen to be the three industries with the lowest average wages, including the temp industry is one of the few that slowed down in 2014.\xc2\xa0 That, of course, would be, in that case, good news.</p>\n<p>This improvement in the quality of jobs translates, as we see in the next slide, into an increase in real wages.\xc2\xa0 We\'re about to have second year in a row in which wages have increased faster than inflation.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, the pace of wage growth over the past two years exceeds the pace of wage growth that we had seen in the previous recovery.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d still like to see more wage growth.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot to overcome in terms of decades of stagnation in wages, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of ideas we have for that, but it\'s important to understand it is translating.</p>\n<p>Part of why all this is happening -- shown in the next slide -- in 2014, for the first time, the United States is now exceeding both Saudi Arabia and Russia in oil production.\xc2\xa0 Earlier, we came to exceed both of them in natural gas production.\xc2\xa0 That combination of an increase in production -- a total of 3.5 million barrels per day, the equivalent to discovering a new Iraq here in the United States -- has combined with the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re using less oil.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re using 1.8 million barrels per day less.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the equivalent of no longer needing the oil from an Angola or a Norway -- has contributed to the fact that global oil prices have fallen more than 40 percent, something that\xe2\x80\x99s also helping the U.S. economic recovery.</p>\n<p>That trend has been very widely noted in energy.\xc2\xa0 Less noted -- as shown in the next slide -- is what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in health care, which is, thanks to the Affordable Care Act -- which, based on new data that came out just last night, has covered 10 million people with insurance who didn\xe2\x80\x99t previously have it -- at the same time, the Affordable Care Act has contributed to a trend of slowing health cost growth.\xc2\xa0 Ten, 15 years ago, you saw double-digit premium growth.\xc2\xa0 You saw businesses warning about the threat that health costs had to America\xe2\x80\x99s competitiveness, to our economy.\xc2\xa0 Now you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the slowest health cost growth in 50 years, premium growth dramatically slowing from what it was before.</p>\n<p>Finally, I just wanted to put all of this in a little bit of international context.\xc2\xa0 The next slide shows you GDP growth around the world -- around advanced economies.\xc2\xa0 And you see the United States\xe2\x80\x99 recovery is far exceeding and outpacing that of our advanced economy peers.\xc2\xa0 And the slide after that gives you another context -- something you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say -- that more than half of the jobs added by advanced economies have been in the United States despite the fact that we have less than one-third of the population.</p>\n<p>The last slide -- I just wanted to briefly say this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an accident.\xc2\xa0 Countries around the world were hit by a similar set of shocks.\xc2\xa0 In some ways the United States\xe2\x80\x99 financial system was worse hit and worse affected in 2008 than many other economies. But we had a very robust fiscal response -- not just the Recovery Act, but the subsequent fiscal measures like the payroll tax cut. We had a very robust response to the financial crisis, including what we did -- autos and housing.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act is contributing to that trend of slower health growth I talked about.\xc2\xa0 The all-of-the-above energy strategy contributing both to greater production but also less use, both of which are helping us.\xc2\xa0 Catalyzing technological innovation with patent reform, spectrum, significant investments.\xc2\xa0 And finally, doing all of this with nearly $4 trillion of deficit reduction from the Budget Control Act, the Affordable Care Act, and the tax deal, which, together with a stronger economy and slowing health cost growth, has brought the deficit down by about two-thirds.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to rest here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot we need to do, both domestically in terms of wages, internationally, working with our partners to strengthen their economies.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is focused on everything from investing in infrastructure, reforming the business tax code, immigration, expanding overseas markets for our goods, and investing in education here in the United States.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions now.\xc2\xa0 Major, you want to go first?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Center for American Progress noted in a recent study that the average family of four earns $10,000 less than it did -- or the cost of living has gone up $10,000 from 2000 to 2012.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times noted that the average family earns less now than it did 15 years ago.\xc2\xa0 I know you noted some nominal improvements in wages, but this is the biggest lagging indicator in the economic recovery, is it not?\xc2\xa0 That wages simply have not grown at anywhere near the rate needed to compensate for what was lost during the Great Recession.\xc2\xa0 When is that going to change?\xc2\xa0 And why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it changed already?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 So let me just take a step back, which is we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a challenge in this regard for decades.\xc2\xa0 That challenge became particularly acute from 2001 to 2007, when we saw reasonably strong economic growth, but median incomes actually fell over the course of that expansion.\xc2\xa0 So that was the first economic expansion in which it didn\xe2\x80\x99t translate into rising incomes for households.\xc2\xa0 Then at the end of that expansion, you had this terrible recession, the worst since World War II, and so you had this blow to incomes when the economy was growing.\xc2\xa0 That blow got even worse when the recession hit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99re not all the way there in digging out of that combination of the longstanding trend and the deep recession.\xc2\xa0 As I showed you, though, we have now had two straight years of wage growth that exceeds inflation.\xc2\xa0 The numbers I was showing you were above and beyond inflation.\xc2\xa0 So wages are growing at about I think 2.5 percent a year.\xc2\xa0 Inflation is a little bit less than 2 percent a year, so those gains are outpacing it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Family incomes also depend on people working, not just that they have wages, and so those job gains will see help as well.\xc2\xa0 So the last census numbers on income we have were for 2013 -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the 2014 numbers, and I expect those to be considerably better.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we won\xe2\x80\x99t get them until next August or September.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you that the currency declines that Russia is experiencing could eventually spill over into the U.S. economy and begin to affect some of the gains that you just talked about?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 If I was chairman of President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s council of economic advisers, I would be extremely concerned.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re between a rock and a hard place in economic policy.\xc2\xa0 The combination of our sanctions, the uncertainty they\xe2\x80\x99ve created for themselves with their international actions, and the falling price of oil has put their economy on the brink of crisis.\xc2\xa0 That gives you only bad choices.\xc2\xa0 You can raise interest rates to defend your currency as they\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and that will contract and hurt your domestic economy, which will further undermine confidence, or you can not do that and allow more of a collapse.</p>\n<p>So I think they are facing a very serious economic situation, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious economic situation that is largely of their own making and largely reflects the consequences of not following a set of international rules.</p>\n<p>In terms of the U.S. economy, we have enormous domestic strengths in terms of our consumers, their confidence, their increased spending, in terms of our businesses investing.\xc2\xa0 Only one-tenth of 1 percent of U.S. GDP is exports to Russia.\xc2\xa0 And I think ultimately a world in which nations around the world are abiding by rules is one that is in our economic interest as well. So I think bringing about a return to that will ultimately be good for the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on Darlene\xe2\x80\x99s question, you say that the U.S. has sort of limited exposure to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0 But what about the potential for the crisis there affecting other partners that the U.S. has to deal with, and sort of affecting the global economy at large?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Even if nothing was going on in Russia, there are a number of challenges that a number of our trading partners are facing -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s something I showed you a little bit in some of those slides with GDP.\xc2\xa0 So the Japanese economy has contracted in three out of the last four quarters.\xc2\xa0 That has little, if anything, to do with the Russian economy, but that does act as a headwind to the U.S. and the trading relationship we have.\xc2\xa0 Growth in Europe has slowed nearly to a halt, and the IMF has put the odds of another recession at 40 percent for Europe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, their analysis and a lot of other analysis, that\xe2\x80\x99s not primarily because of Russia; that\xe2\x80\x99s because of weak domestic demand in the eurozone and the need for both some combination of fiscal and monetary policy to address that weak demand.\xc2\xa0 A number of emerging markets have also slowed -- places like China that are much bigger trading partners for the United States and much more important in the global economy than Russia is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I certainly think the U.S. economy does face a challenge and a headwind from slowdowns around the world; I just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t locate that primarily in Russia.\xc2\xa0 And the answer to that is to continue to strengthen ourselves domestically while engaging, as you saw the President do at the G20, to help our partners strengthen their economies.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I see you\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined some impressive statistics and record-breaking private sector job growth.\xc2\xa0 Why is it that most people don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be feeling it?\xc2\xa0 You see pessimism reflected in the polling.\xc2\xa0 People are pessimistic not only about their own economic prospects but the prospects for their children, consumer sentiment.\xc2\xa0 Why is that not breaking through?\xc2\xa0 And what you do you think it will take to make that breakthrough?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was hoping someone would say consumer sentiment, because the people in charge of polling that consumer sentiment, the University of Michigan -- they do a regular poll on that -- I just wanted to read from their press release from just last week.\xc2\xa0 They said, \xe2\x80\x9cRecord numbers of consumers spontaneously reported hearing about recent gains in employment and falling gas prices in early December.\xc2\xa0 More importantly, expected wage gains rose to their highest level since 2008.\xc2\xa0 And consumers voiced the most favorable buying attitudes in several decades.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This is their poll on consumer sentiment, not mine.\xc2\xa0 Continuing to quote:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, consumers held the most favorable long-term expectations for the economy in the past decade.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>You see that in a number of different measures.\xc2\xa0 The sentiments are now higher than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been at any point since the recovery began.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still substantial challenges.\xc2\xa0 And it goes back to what Major said.\xc2\xa0 You saw a decade in which incomes didn\'t rise.\xc2\xa0 You saw another huge blow to incomes in the recession.\xc2\xa0 You see us digging out of that but not all the way dug out of it, so that people are still feeling challenges, that people are still feeling not all the way there.\xc2\xa0 And our motivation to continue to help, but I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate to say that you\'re not seeing this translate into sentiment.\xc2\xa0 Every economic measure I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen has improved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s morning in America?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s morning in America.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re digging our way out of a really deep hole, and we\'re still not all the way out of that hole.\xc2\xa0 The unemployment rate at 5.8 percent is not all the way to where the unemployment rate should be.\xc2\xa0 Wages are certainly not all the way to where they want to be, but absolutely moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh.\xc2\xa0 What about these falling oil prices, though, that you mentioned, that people do appreciate seeing low prices at the pump, but Wall Street has been feeling some jitters.\xc2\xa0 The Dow has plunged nearly a thousand points in the last week or so. That might translate into people being concerned about their 401(k) plans and maybe not spend as much during the holidays.\xc2\xa0 What do you make of that?\xc2\xa0 Are you spooked at all by these gas prices that have dropped so dramatically?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Most of the independent estimates of gas prices track our own analysis, which is that the reduction in gas prices is a net positive for the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 The International Monetary Fund, for example, said they expect to see advanced economy growth rates on average rise by about eight-tenths of a percentage point as a result of the lower price of oil.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re talking about a very substantial tax cut that goes directly into your pockets, and goes there this week, next week, the week after from that.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s winners and losers in the global economy from these changes in gas prices and that that is creating -- that\'s contributing to some turmoil in the global economy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the biggest risk to the U.S. economy is the impact the rest of the world could have on our economy because we have such strong domestic strengths.\xc2\xa0 On balance, this is definitely a positive, but we\'re certainly monitoring both sides of the ledger.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know Major tried to ask you this and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you actually answered it, but if the problem is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had growth but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t widely shared and the average family\xe2\x80\x99s income I don\'t think has gone up since like 1989, when do you expect that to change?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you actually --</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean you saw median income go up in 2013. We don\'t have the numbers yet for 2014, but I expect them to go up there.\xc2\xa0 We have a quarterly wage series called Usual Weekly Earnings, which gives you wages at different points along the income spectrum.\xc2\xa0 Interestingly, in the last two years, wages for workers that the 10th or 25th I think even 50th percentile have risen more quickly than wages for those at the 90th percentile.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is wages the same as average family income?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, we just get wages every quarter and we get income every year.\xc2\xa0 And the income, we, unfortunately, need to wait until eight or nine months after the year ends to find those numbers.\xc2\xa0 So income is the more comprehensive measure, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the less timely one, which is why I was switching back and forth.</p>\n<p>But I think, as I said, the job quality -- we have a lot of challenges in our economy longstanding in terms of job quality, in terms of polarization and losing jobs in the middle and getting jobs at either end.\xc2\xa0 But the strengthening economy that we saw in 2014 meant that all that got better in 2014; meant that real wages went up -- not close enough to make up for the challenges -- for the problems that we saw before that.\xc2\xa0 We still have a long way to go in terms of wages and income.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the strengthening economy translate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t solved all our economic problems yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a prediction to make about when?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a prediction to make about when, but we would -- we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing what you expect to see, which is in the early stages of recovery the unemployment rate falls, and then that starts to translate into wages.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve now seen two years in a row where wages are exceeding inflation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other question.\xc2\xa0 One of the kind of political problems for the administration has been that even though there is all this good economic numbers, people don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it -- partially because average American incomes haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone up, but also because big-ticket items, despite low inflation elsewhere, have been going up really fast -- like the cost of college and health care.\xc2\xa0 So what is the better measure of how the average person experiences the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of people have wrestled with exactly that question.\xc2\xa0 The CPI is the accurate measure in that it reflects the proportion of spending you have on college, the proportion on health care, the proportion on food -- which tends to go down -- the proportion on gas.\xc2\xa0 There are certainly some things which tend to be more salient.\xc2\xa0 Certainly when gas prices are increasing, even if overall inflation is low, you often -- consumers, they see that big sign every week and they feel it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously going the other direction right now.</p>\n<p>You cited health care.\xc2\xa0 Health care, the slowest growth we\xe2\x80\x99ve had on record in this country -- and the data goes back to 1960 -- was in 2013.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, after tremendous --</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Right, after tremendous increases, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And health costs are still high.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 After the passage of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Health costs are still high.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no dispute over that.\xc2\xa0 But the growth rate is -- again, the growth rate is slowing to a degree that almost no one expected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, can I follow on health care?\xc2\xa0 You obviously have a better story to tell as well about healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s not completely your area, but since we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about health care --</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s working well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my area.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then you like it.\xc2\xa0 Quick question.\xc2\xa0 The insurance industry is saying maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a glitch, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a bigger problem, where when people are trying to renew, people who signed up for the first time last year, this is the first time they can renew, and there is some difficulty between the government and the insurance industry in terms of communicating from a technological standpoint, and there is some concern some people who have paid their premiums won\xe2\x80\x99t be covered.\xc2\xa0 How confident are you that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to fix that?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I would want people who are working on the website to answer those types of technical questions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 David, did you have your hand up?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Pardon me if this has been asked before, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, I mean, how big a factor were the sanctions contributing to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economic problems?\xc2\xa0 Is it second to the oil price situation?\xc2\xa0 How much has the U.S. and its allies caused what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Russia now?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think there are three things that have contributed.\xc2\xa0 I think sanctions have contributed, and we\'ve targeted -- when we went beyond the individuals which affected key supporters of the regime to the sectoral sanctions and focusing on the energy industry, which is central to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy, on the financial industry, which is central to any economy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to function, and on the military industry -- that had a substantial impact on their economy.\xc2\xa0 The uncertainty they\xe2\x80\x99ve created has reduced both foreign investment and domestic investment and they\xe2\x80\x99re not the partner that most companies around the world want to have economically right now, given the way they\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then, finally, the oil prices obviously layer on top of that.\xc2\xa0 But even before this decline in the price of oil, just a few months ago, their economy was in a much worse shape than it had been before Crimea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the U.S. deal with the fallout from Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economic problems?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 In terms of our domestic economy, I already cited it\'s one-tenth of 1 percent of our GDP.\xc2\xa0 I think the global economy is a headwind for the U.S. economy, but I think that, as I said before, is more places like Japan and Europe and China that are slowing for reasons largely unrelated to the Russian situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, when you were talking about wages earlier, you said there are a lot of ideas that we have for that, suggesting that the President has obviously new initiatives to talk about in the Supreme Court or whatever, going forward.\xc2\xa0 And on your list that you had on your slide you included, of course, trade and business tax code reform.\xc2\xa0 Thinking about wage gain as the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal maybe for the end of his tenure as President, which of those -- business tax code reform or trade, which he could work with Republicans on in the final years -- would deliver the most for wage gains in the short term?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a \xe2\x80\x9cthis one is more\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthis one is less.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I tend to think as the challenge of family incomes is an interplay of three factors:\xc2\xa0 One, what the productivity growth of the economy is; two, the ability of workers to connect with that productivity growth, so inequality; and three -- and The New York Times has been doing a good series on this -- people that actually get jobs and be employed.\xc2\xa0 And those three efforts complement each other.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of steps, like education, that can enhance productivity growth, reduce inequality and help more people have jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so we want to be working on all three of those overarching economic goals simultaneously.\xc2\xa0 And everything I listed there would help.\xc2\xa0 You want -- something like business tax reform helps your productivity growth.\xc2\xa0 But you want to take other steps to make sure people can take advantage of that -- be more educated, more skilled, raise the minimum wage so that when a company is expanding people are also getting paid more.\xc2\xa0 So these steps all work together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- send any ripples through the economy, or do you believe this is the time when that can -- that has already ended at the end of October and will not have any noticeable --</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a comment on the Fed or a prediction of the impact of it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s over.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is will that change the way the economy has performed -- because you have something that was in the economy for a considerable amount of time that kept interest rates low that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer there, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about Fed policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The only observation I\xe2\x80\x99d make is the 10-year Treasury right now is lower than where it was three months ago, and consumers are substantially deleveraged, are seeing real wage gains.\xc2\xa0 Business investment has picked up over the last year.\xc2\xa0 And so I think we have a lot of domestic momentum in our economy right now.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jason.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll be having a short economics quiz after today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Darlene, we can go back to regularly scheduled business if you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us if the President will sign the spending bill, the government bill today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As of latest report earlier this morning, the White House had not yet received the enrolled version of the bill, but once the President -- once the White House has received that enrolled version, the President will sign it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that in order to prevent a government shutdown, that would need to be signed before the end of the day tomorrow, and I would anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99d be able to meet that deadline.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it will be today or tomorrow, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it done in order to avoid a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you all know when it\xe2\x80\x99s done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then to go back to the Russian currency decline.\xc2\xa0 Can you say if what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Russia would make the President more or less likely to sign the sanctions bill that Congress -- that cleared Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Darlene, as you know, the United States and the Obama administration have been working very closely with our allies to implement a sanctions regime against Russia that has had, as Jason was describing, a devastating impact on their economy.\xc2\xa0 It has also isolated them from the global community on a variety of fronts, including in the area of the economy.</p>\n<p>So the success that we have had in implementing this sanctions strategy has depended on a lot of flexibility.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is we have -- as Jason mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s not significant U.S. exposure to the Russian economy, that they only consist of one-tenth of 1 percent of our GDP in terms of U.S. exports to Russia.\xc2\xa0 But some of our partners in Europe have a much bigger impact on the Russian economy, and by being able to work in close concert with those European allies, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to maximize the impact of our sanctions strategy against Russia.</p>\n<p>And what we have tried to do is we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to optimize the impact on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy while at the same time mitigating the impact of the sanctions regime on American businesses.\xc2\xa0 We certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want American businesses to be held at a significant competitive disadvantage as a result of this strategy.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also tried to mitigate the impact on the broader global economy to make sure that, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re targeting the impact on the Russian economy in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have dramatic spillover effects into the broader economy.\xc2\xa0 You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t eliminate that entirely, but you can ensure that the focal point of the impact is on Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we have succeeded in doing that.</p>\n<p>That all being said, the President does intend to sign the piece of legislation that was passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 But we do have some concerns about that legislation because while it preserves flexibility, it does send a confusing message to our allies, because it includes some sanctions language that does not reflect the consultations that are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Typically, the kinds of consultations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had that have allowed for the successful implementation of the strategy have allowed us to have private conversations with our European allies about our strategies and next steps forward.\xc2\xa0 This obviously is a rather public airing of other elements of our strategy that we prefer not to have.\xc2\xa0 That said, because it does preserve the President\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility to carry out this strategy, he does intend to sign the bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of how soon he will sign it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the end of the week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that it would get done before the end of the week.\xc2\xa0 Again, that will be contingent on, however, the receipt of the fully enrolled version of the bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one last question.\xc2\xa0 Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy has been having a difficult time for some time, and President Putin hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed his behavior towards Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The current currency situation, do you think that will finally get him to change his behavior toward Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, he\xe2\x80\x99s the only one that knows.\xc2\xa0 But what is I think crystal clear to everybody around the world is that what we have said about this strategy has come to pass.\xc2\xa0 We have suggested that the longer the sanctions regime is in place, the more isolated the Russians would be and the greater the impact it would have on the broader Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And every week and month that goes by that the sanctions regime is in place we see that the toll that is being taken by the Russian economy grows.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re now starting to see -- as is clear from the extraordinary action that was taken by the Russian government overnight, Russia time, to dramatically increase the interest rate is an indication that the bite on the Russian economy is only becoming stronger.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, though, it will be up to President Putin to decide whether or not these economic costs are worth it to him and are worth it to the Russian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has been very clear, and the President was clear about his even at the news conference that he did at the NATO Summit, where this was obviously discussed in some detail, that the President and our partners stand ready to begin to roll back the sanctions regime against Russia as soon as Russia demonstrates a clear commitment to implementing the kinds of commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made to deescalate the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 But we have not seen Russia follow through on those promises and, as a result, that sanctions regime has remained in place.\xc2\xa0 And as long as that sanctions regime remains in place, the cost on the Russian economy will continue to increase.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. prepared to do, if anything, to address the school attack in Pakistan or provide assistance in the wake of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, you saw the statement from the President that went out earlier today.\xc2\xa0 And what he said is something that I will repeat, which is that the United States condemns these attacks in the strongest possible terms, and our hearts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true of the First Family and that\xe2\x80\x99s also true of everybody here at the White House today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s also emblematic of a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The depraved decision that one has to make to storm a school of innocent children and open fire on them I think is a testament to how cold-blooded these extremists are.\xc2\xa0 It also is a clear indication of something that we have said on a number of occasions, which is that many of these religious extremists are carrying out attacks that have a substantial impact, in terms of the number of victims, on Muslims.\xc2\xa0 And I know that many of these extremists like to characterize their struggle as a struggle of Muslims against the Western world, but that clearly is not true if the largest number of victims that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing are actually Muslims. And that makes this situation all the more heartbreaking and all the more tragic.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that, through a variety of channels, the United States has been in touch with Pakistan officials to offer assistance.\xc2\xa0 Much of this outreach has been driven by U.S. Ambassador Olsen in Pakistan to arrange with Pakistani officials. I know that Ambassador Olsen actually traveled with a senior Pakistani official to go donate blood at the Pakistan Red Crescent today.\xc2\xa0 That is emblematic of the kind of support that we here in the United States have for the people of Pakistan as they confront this terrible act of violence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So beyond donating blood and thoughts and prayers, are there concrete actions that the United States can take to assist or to respond to this attack?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that that kind of assistance that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to has been offered.\xc2\xa0 But this is a situation that\xe2\x80\x99s only very recently been resolved and I anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be in touch with Pakistani leaders in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, does this attack in Pakistan cause any concern on the part of this administration that perhaps this withdrawal from Afghanistan is wise?\xc2\xa0 I know that the President authorized more troops, a thousand more troops, roughly, than was previously planned for next year and that those soldiers may be engaged in counterterror operations.\xc2\xa0 Is that capacity preserved only for Pakistan -- or only for Afghanistan, or might it also be applicable in Pakistan as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, this troop commitment that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, this thousand troop commitment, is merely a bridge through the end of this year as our NATO allies and other partners in this conflict in Afghanistan make their troop commitments and deploy them to the region.\xc2\xa0 So this is only a temporary expansion of the previous policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President does believe -- the President is committed to ensuring that we remain on track for the responsible drawdown that the President has outlined in terms of our military presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And the strategy -- or the mission that our troops in Afghanistan are pursuing right now is one that is focused on counterterrorism in a way that will ensure -- assist the Afghan government but also ensure the protection of American personnel that are still in that country.</p>\n<p>It also will entail training Afghan security forces so that they can continue the process of taking responsibility for the security situation in their country.\xc2\xa0 I do think that this scenario and this terrible event that occurred in Pakistan sort of highlights the violent tendencies of some of these extremist groups, which, in turn, underscores the need to do all that we can to strengthen and support Afghan security forces as they try to protect their country and their citizens from some of these extremist groups that aren\xe2\x80\x99t just carrying out acts of violence against Muslims in Pakistan, they\xe2\x80\x99re also carrying out acts of violence against Muslims in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this neighborhood will soon be on its own, essentially.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States is going to continue to stand with our partners in Afghanistan in the same way that we stand with our partners in Pakistan as well.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 One is we obviously are very closely invested in the stability of Afghanistan and continuing to work with the central government that is making some important decisions that will preserve that security and making the kinds of investments that are critical to maintaining that stability.</p>\n<p>The United States is also invested in continuing to work closely with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We have a very important counterterrorism relationship with Pakistan, and I would anticipate that that relationship will endure, primarily because it significantly benefits the citizens of both Pakistan and the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So these kinds of relationships and our involvement in these areas will continue and will endure because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the American people and our national security.\xc2\xa0 What will change, however, is the kind of military footprint that\'s been in place in Afghanistan for more than 13 years now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask you about the omnibus?\xc2\xa0 I know some of this got covered last week, and you mentioned that the President was not really happy about that provision that loosened some of the regulations in Dodd-Frank.\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve probably seen some of the talk about that revision and how it was slipped in by Congressman Yoder, and the claim has been made in news reports that Citibank wrote that provision.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- do you know for a fact whether Citibank, word for word or nearly word for word, wrote that provision that\'s in this bill?\xc2\xa0 And I know you said the President is not happy about this provision, but does that response really match some of the disgust that is out there with respect to this provision?\xc2\xa0 Because people are sort of -- this is sort of an outrage to a lot of people that allegedly Citibank just wrote a provision weakening Dodd-Frank regulations in this bill.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, this was a bill written by Congress.\xc2\xa0 And whether one element of that bill was plagiarized by a member of Congress from a Citibank lobbyist is something that you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask a member of Congress.</p>\n<p>The White House was certainly in the loop as the discussions about these provisions took place.\xc2\xa0 But the White House -- regardless of who wrote the provision -- strongly opposes it and doesn\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea because it does water down one element of Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that we should actually be implementing Wall Street reform in a robust way that will ensure that American taxpayers and American businesses and American middle-class families have the kinds of protections that they need to ensure that taxpayers are no longer and never again on the hook for the risky bets that are made by Wall Street firms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not sure whether Citibank or people at Citibank wrote that provision?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 Again, Congress was responsible for drafting this legislation, so you should ask somebody in Congress who wrote it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And speaking of the omnibus and what happened over the weekend, Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s office appears to be thanking Ted Cruz for I guess delaying the debate or prolonging the debate on that to the extent that it allowed the Senator to bring some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees forward for a vote.\xc2\xa0 And in the spirit of the holidays, are you sending the Senator a fruitcake or -- (laughter).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I saw Dan Pfeiffer\xe2\x80\x99s tweet last night.\xc2\xa0 Are you essentially saying that Ted Cruz is responsible for the Surgeon General getting through, and Tony Blinken?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert in Senate floor procedure. I can tell you that this White House has worked very closely with Senator Reid and other Senate Democrats to ensure the prompt and fair consideration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s highly qualified nominees for a variety of important positions across the United States government.\xc2\xa0 And we are gratified that some of these nominees are finally moving forward.</p>\n<p>Dr. Murthy is a tremendous example of this.\xc2\xa0 This is an individual who was eminently qualified for this position and I think will stand to offer quite a bit to the American people in service of his country in this role.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re gratified.</p>\n<p>As it relates to Senator Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s role, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me -- again, because I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert in Senate procedure -- how responsible he is exactly for this.\xc2\xa0 I do understand, based on the news reports that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, that some of the shenanigans that he carried out on the Senate floor did create an opening and additional time for these highly qualified nominees to be confirmed.\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then it may be an indication that Senator Cruz doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know much more about Senate floor procedure than I do, but we certainly are pleased with the outcome.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s deadline day for the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Do we have any -- do we know up to this point what signups look like, what demographics look like, how old, how young, need subsidies, don\xe2\x80\x99t need subsidies -- any stats at all that you can share?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any statistics at this point.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- what I can tell you is just as a general matter that volume on the website was rather high.\xc2\xa0 It was high at the call center as well.\xc2\xa0 This is typical of what we saw around deadlines last year during the open enrollment period.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are gratified that the website performed as expected, which is something that came as a big relief to everybody here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 It also is something that significantly enhanced the convenience of people across the country who took advantage of the opportunity to consider the options that were available to them and to choose an option that was in the best interest of their families.\xc2\xa0 So we are pleased with the way that that process has been carried out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re still going through the numbers in terms of determining exactly how many people did benefit from this just here in the last few days, but when we have additional data to share on this -- I anticipate it will come from HHS -- but we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that all of you get it as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that the President last week, and I guess this week too, has spent a lot of time trying to reach out to younger demographics -- Colbert\xe2\x80\x99s show, Ryan Seacrest\xe2\x80\x99s show.\xc2\xa0 Is that an indication that the under-30 crowd is still lagging in signups and enrollment from your perspective?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that really the target audience still, moving forward?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99d say about that is I think the way that I would describe it to you is that certainly young adults -- many of whom are starting out in their career -- have the most to gain, that they stand to benefit from the kind of strategy that we have put in place for making sure that people have access to quality and affordable health insurance coverage.<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have tried to be very clear about the benefits that are available to them just by going to the website.</p>\n<p>It certainly is not just young people who can benefit from this, but they are certainly a group of people who are least likely to be able to get coverage through their employer because they\xe2\x80\x99re at the beginning of their career.\xc2\xa0 And so many of them are in a position to, for the first time, because of the Affordable Care Act, actually have another option.\xc2\xa0 And that means that they can go on the Affordable Care Act website and allow for insurance companies to compete for their business.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of competition drives down prices.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you need more of those folks in there, right, because of the risk -- you just talked about, to bring -- to keep prices low?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly welcome participation from everybody, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard to make sure that everybody is aware of the options that are available to them from the website.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that a substantial number of young people in this country have some tremendous benefits awaiting them if they go online and shop for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the ruble crisis.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the ruble has been down -- the last time I looked, about 19 percent in the past two days.\xc2\xa0 Lavrov is talking about maybe moving nukes into Crimea.\xc2\xa0 There are Russians scrambling to buy any hard goods they can today because they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of hyperinflation.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. concerned that our efforts to punish Russia over Ukraine have gone too far, with the plunge in the ruble, and that there may be some geopolitical risks here -- that there could be some fallout that could be disruptive?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I think what I would say is that the most substantial geopolitical risk associated with this situation is the Russian regime continuing to trample on the basic international rules that large countries all around the globe should accept.\xc2\xa0 They should be respecting the basic territorial integrity of their neighbors, particularly their smaller ones.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is a widely accepted international norm.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- the international community is going to hold, and has held, Russia accountable for blatantly violating them.\xc2\xa0 And that is a substantial -- allowing that kind of inappropriate interference across the border with Ukraine without any consequences would have significant geopolitical downside.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is you have weighed this and you believe that -- not you, personally, but the United States has actually weighed this and we don\xe2\x80\x99t think, the U.S. government, that there\xe2\x80\x99s too much geopolitical risk with creating -- by putting Putin\xe2\x80\x99s back to the wall and the specter of hyperinflation in his country today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be as direct as I can about this, which is that the reason that we have acted in the first place and the reason that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the United States work so closely with our allies in Europe and around the world to isolate Russia is because we are concerned about Vladimir Putin and the Russian regime blatantly violating generally accepted international norms.\xc2\xa0 They have done this by inappropriately interfering with their neighbors across an internationally accepted border.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the international community respond in coordinated fashion because they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about demonstrating to Russia and to other countries in the world that may be considering similar actions that the international community will not stand for that kind of blatant violation of international norms and rules.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last follow-up -- would you say that this plunge of the ruble and the scrambling around the country, people trying to buy hard goods, is a sign of success of U.S. policy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is a sign of the failure of Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s strategy to try to buck up his country; that right now, he and his country are isolated from the broader international community.\xc2\xa0 They are taking desperate actions to try to shore up the strength of their currency.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re enduring significant downgrades as it relates to their credit worthiness and as it relates to longer-term economic projections about their growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is Vladimir Putin actually is the person in the world with the most consequential role to play in trying to reverse this trend.\xc2\xa0 If merely he will live up to the kinds of commitments that he\xe2\x80\x99s already made in the context of the Minsk negotiations, you could see the international community start to relax these sanctions in a way that would relieve the pressure on the people of Russia and on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And that would be good for the world.\xc2\xa0 It would send a very clear signal that respecting these basic international norms is important, and it would also allow President Putin to demonstrate to his people that he\xe2\x80\x99s actually concerned about their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Jon.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on that -- and this, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting at here -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a risk that the success of the sanctions, as you put it, combined with what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the oil markets and what\xe2\x80\x99s happened to Russia, that it will have the exact opposite effect of what U.S. policy is trying to do, which is to get Putin to back down?\xc2\xa0 What if it provokes Putin to act in a more aggressive way?\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen some signs of this -- the aggressive actions, I would add also, of the Russian air force in recent days.\xc2\xa0 And what do we do if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case?\xc2\xa0 I mean, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve done the sanctions thing.\xc2\xa0 You certainly aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to hurt the Russian economy any more.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think --<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or are you?\xc2\xa0 I mean --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 I think that the -- once again, going back to where we were, the consequences of allowing Putin to send the army, or at least Russian military personnel across the border into Ukraine to support the activities of the separatists in eastern Ukraine, allowing that to go without consequence would send a very dangerous signal to President Putin.\xc2\xa0 It would also send a very dangerous signal to other countries around the world that may have designs in improperly interfering with some of their neighbors as well.<br/>\n\tSo seeing the international community act in coordinated fashion to counter those steps I think does send an important signal and does ensure that U.S. interests and our broader interest in a peaceful world are advanced.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt -- the second thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is this:\xc2\xa0 As the sanctions regime remains in place, the impact it has on the economy in Russia continues to grow.\xc2\xa0 There haven\'t been substantial increases in our sanctions regime in the last couple of months, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that as the weeks and months roll by, the impact on the Russian economy continues to bite even harder.<br/>\n\tAnd that is a testament to the way in which Russia is isolated, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the kind of risk that President Putin runs when he fails to live up to the kinds of commitments that he\xe2\x80\x99s already made, because the international community has said once you demonstrate a willingness to start living up to these commitments and respecting basic international norms, we can start to relax our sanctions regime in a way that will relieve the pressure on your economy.<br/>\n\tSo again, it is President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make here about what he wants to do that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of his people and the country that he leads.\xc2\xa0 And this is the same fundamental question that President Putin faced this spring.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same question that he faced this summer as the sanctions regime was put in place.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same question that he faced this fall as the sanctions regime was increased.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the same question that he faces this winter as the sanctions that are in place start to clamp down even tighter on the Russian economy.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you see a possibility that the decision he will make will be to act more aggressively and more dangerously?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is that if the international community were to turn a blind eye to his blatant violation of the border with Ukraine, that would only encourage him to take more aggressive action against other countries along his border.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody has stood up here and suggested that putting in place the sanctions regime would automatically make Vladimir Putin a model citizen.\xc2\xa0 That was never the prediction, and that certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the aim is to get him to back down.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The aim is to sharpen the choice that he faces.\xc2\xa0 And that choice between interfering in Ukraine and looking out for the economic wellbeing of the people of his country does come into more sharp relief every single day.<br/>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Josh, one more question along those lines.\xc2\xa0 Is there a danger that the real pain that average Russians are feeling that they will respond to it as they have frankly responded to some of the earlier layers of sanctions, and that\'s to rally around Putin even more and maybe fan the flames of Russian nationalism and some would say xenophobia?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no expert on Russian public opinion or Russian politics.\xc2\xa0 My predecessor certainly had more experience in this area.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that in the same way that there is a choice that\'s facing President Putin, the Russian people are acutely aware of that choice too.\xc2\xa0 They understand very clearly that the decisions that President Putin is making as it relates to their foreign policy in Ukraine is having an impact on their economy.\xc2\xa0 And it ultimately will be up to their leader to decide if he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to roll back some of those decisions so that he can try to protect the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic wellbeing.</p>\n<p>I think that fundamental choice is well known among the Russian people.\xc2\xa0 There is an analogy here, and I always hesitate to draw analogies between different situations, and I often am in a position of encouraging you not to do so, but I will just hesitatingly wade into this and suggest that the sanctions regime that the United States worked with the international community to put in place against Iran did have the effect of compelling Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regime to come to the negotiating table with the international community.\xc2\xa0 And that was at least in part based on some public pressure that the Iranian political leadership was feeling, because they understood -- the Iranian population understood that the kinds of foreign policy national security decisions that the Iranian leadership was making was having a very negative effect on their economy.</p>\n<p>The same dynamic is in play in Russia -- that the decisions that are being made by the Russian regime in terms of flouting generally accepted international standards and Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty is also having a negative impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 So Russia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders understand that.\xc2\xa0 Russia\xe2\x80\x99s citizens understand that too.</p>\n<p>Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert in terms of trying to figure out or predict exactly what their reaction will be.\xc2\xa0 But based on the reaction that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a similar situation in Iran, and I think based on the fact that there is a lot of transparency about what exactly is happening here, I do think that the logical conclusion of many Russian citizens would be to say, hey, it sure would be nice for us to have more influence on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Ukraine, but, gee, it also sure would be nice to have some confidence that the value of my retirement savings is not going through the floor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you think they see that choice despite the pretty iron control of the state-controlled media and what the average Russian sees when they turn on the TV or even --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do, primarily because I think that as much as that regime tries to limit the access to information of the citizens, I think that the extreme economic consequences of this decision are readily apparent to every Russian citizen, even those who are not consuming state media.</p>\n<p>Juliet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the question of nominees, as you mentioned earlier, you\'re clearly making some progress in moving some of those through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But, of course, next year you face a Republican-controlled Senate and different rules.\xc2\xa0 How confident are you that the President can get the nominees he wants, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the executive or judicial branch, to really implement policy and achieve the goals that he\xe2\x80\x99s worked on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would anticipate that there will be some members of the United States Senate on the Republican side of the aisle who will attempt to capitalize on their new majority to prevent the President from appointing highly qualified individuals to serve the American people.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is a strategy that will lead to long-term political success for the Republican Party or even for individual members of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 I could be wrong about that, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll hazard that guess here at the end of this year.</p>\n<p>The United States Senate -- and I think this is generally understood by the American people -- has a responsibility to give careful consideration to individuals that the President believes are highly qualified to serve the American people in senior federal government positions.\xc2\xa0 The American people understand that the Senate has a responsibility to consider those nominees carefully and to vote on them.</p>\n<p>And that certainly is the expectation that this administration has had of Democratic-led Senates, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an expectation that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have of Republican-led Senates too.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, let me reverse the question on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 What would it take for the United States to be amenable to reducing the sanctions if, in fact, Russia began to economically --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It would take President Putin and the Russian regime living up to the kinds of commitments they made in Minsk, and it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to reflect a genuine commitment to respecting the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the nation of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would that entail, the second part, giving out -- giving back Crimea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard, again, to sort of lay out an exact prescription, but there are specific commitments that President Putin did make to the Ukrainians and to the international community in the context of the Minsk talks.\xc2\xa0 And there are some basic things that they can do as it relates to the movement of personnel, the movement of equipment and materiel across the border.\xc2\xa0 Those are things that we have pretty loudly complained about, and we have done so because that violates a basic international norm.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t just send your military personnel or your -- or military equipment to citizens of another country against the will of the host government.</p>\n<p>So we have made very clear to President Putin -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean not just the United States but I mean the international community made very clear about what our concerns are about their behavior and what are the kinds of steps they can take that would precipitate at least the relaxing of some of these sanctions that have had such a terrible toll on their economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could some sanctions be released even with Russian forces dominating Crimea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to negotiate it out here.\xc2\xa0 We certainly are very concerned about how Russia has attempted to annex Crimea, and we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about their activities there as well.\xc2\xa0 But there are specific commitments that have been made in the context of the Minsk talks that would -- that if they lived up to them and we saw a corresponding commitment to these basic international norms where I think you would see the international community -- this is a commitment that the President made right after the conclusion of the NATO meeting -- to start to relax some of these sanctions in a way that would relieve at least some of the pressure on the Russian economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned a few moments ago that the White House, the administration was in the loop as discussions took place on this particular provision, taking away some component of Dodd-Frank.\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9cin the loop\xe2\x80\x9d as the discussions took place, I take it to mean the administration aware of and did not strongly object.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 When I said \xe2\x80\x9cin the loop,\xe2\x80\x9d I meant on the discussions about the writing of the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 I have declined to get into sort of the details of the many conversations that took place across many different open channels, open lines of communication between the administration and Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me discourage you from so declining.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Was the administration blindsided by this provision?\xc2\xa0 Or did it have some visibility, some awareness that it was in the omnibus and, considering all the other things that were in there, not objectionable enough to issue a veto threat?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for specific provisions based on specific conversations, primarily because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to steer you wrong.\xc2\xa0 We had multiple officials at the Treasury Department, multiple officials here in the West Wing of the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t say you were blindsided?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say is that certainly no one is surprised by the fact that the President is strongly opposed to this specific provision, because when it was moved through the House of Representatives as a standalone measure, we articulated our strong opposition to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know as well as I do that there are things in the context of those negotiations in which you drew very strong objections to and did not end up in the bill, the things you pushed for and sent signals about that did end up in the bill. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find out where this fell in that continuum of negotiations.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a worthy pursuit.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not one I\xe2\x80\x99m able to assist with.\xc2\xa0 But I would concede the broader point that you\xe2\x80\x99re making, which is this is a compromise and it did mean that the administration was in a position and the President is in a position where he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to sign a piece of legislation that includes some things in it that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xc2\xa0 But it is the essence of the kind of compromise, an attempt to find common ground in pursuit of a broader goal, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be critical to our country\xe2\x80\x99s success and certainly the success of the next Congress over the next two years.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just back on what Mr. Acosta was asking earlier about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday said basically the war in Afghanistan is coming to an end at the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 And then hours later, the Taliban goes into Pakistan, goes into a school, and kills over 140 people -- mostly kids.\xc2\xa0 Is the Taliban sending a signal that the war is not over, and once we leave this is going to be a replay of Iraq -- we pull out, ISIS fills the vacuum?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, this is the Pakistani Taliban that has claimed credit for this particular attack.\xc2\xa0 And what they said was that they were --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And attacks from the Taliban on the Afghan side have been increasing in recent days as well.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but as it relates to this specific school, what the Pakistani Taliban -- again, they claimed credit or responsibility for this attack.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to say from here exactly who was responsible.\xc2\xa0 This is something that, as you would expect, Pakistani authorities are looking into.</p>\n<p>But what those who claimed responsibility for this attack have said is that they were reacting to the latest Pakistani military offensive in this restive region of the country.\xc2\xa0 But to your more broad question about the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because the President himself yesterday said it\xe2\x80\x99s not a great situation in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He was honest about that, so that\xe2\x80\x99s my question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good one, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that our military and the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team as a whole has been very focused on.</p>\n<p>That is why the enduring mission of our military men and women who continue to serve in Afghanistan is focused on two things.\xc2\xa0 One is the kinds of counterterrorism activities that will benefit American national security, first and foremost, but also have a benefit on the stability of the central government in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They will also be engaged in an ongoing effort to train and advise and assist Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 This has been a long-running effort.\xc2\xa0 And there is no doubt -- and I think everybody even at the Pentagon would concede -- that there have been fits and starts associated with this training program.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt -- or there is no denying the fact I think at this point, however, that substantial progress has been made, that we have seen the capability and competence of Afghan security forces improve rather significantly over the last several years.\xc2\xa0 And their continued improvement continues to be in the national security interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to see a sustained commitment to that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t we hear the same from the President, though, at the end of 2011?\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe\'re leaving behind a [sovereign], stable self-reliant Iraq\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d -- almost the same words he just said about Afghanistan -- and then it collapses, ISIS goes in and fills the vacuum.\xc2\xa0 How worried are you we\'re going to have a replay?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But, Ed, I do think this highlights a key difference from the strategy that this President has pursued from the strategy that was pursued by the previous administration:\xc2\xa0 No longer can the United States be in the situation where we\'re doing it for the host country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In the situation with Iraq, they were left a stable and peaceful country.\xc2\xa0 This is a sentiment that even Senator McCain himself acknowledged was the case.\xc2\xa0 What we saw, however, was a failure by the central government of Iraq to unite that country to confront the threats that they face.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the lynchpin of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for confronting ISIL was based on the success of the central government in Iraq actually governing in an inclusive fashion that would inspire the confidence of the people of Iraq that they should unite together to face down this common threat.</p>\n<p>So the point is we\'re employing a similar strategy in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We want to see the Afghan government govern in a way that is genuinely inclusive.\xc2\xa0 And we are encouraged by the early reports of this newly formed government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This democratic transition that we saw over the course of the fall was historic for Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time we\xe2\x80\x99d seen the peaceful, democratic transfer of power in Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 So there are certainly challenges that they face and will face, and there will be setbacks.\xc2\xa0 But the United States of America remains committed to standing with our partners in Afghanistan as they try to rebuild and strengthen their country.</p>\n<p>We will stand with them not by committing a substantial number of American military personnel to serving on the ground in that country.\xc2\xa0 But we will stand with them when it comes to counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 We will stand with them when it comes to training their security forces.\xc2\xa0 We will stand with them as it relates to broader national security agreements that are beneficial to American national security and beneficial to the security of that country.\xc2\xa0 And there are also important economic and diplomatic investments that will endure as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick ones on CIA interrogation.\xc2\xa0 James Mitchell -- who you\'ve probably seen, was one of the contractors who was involved in putting together the interrogation program -- did an interview last night with Megyn Kelly and said that the Senate panel\xe2\x80\x99s report, which you supported the release of -- they put it out, but you supported it -- he claims that\'s put his life in jeopardy, that the police called him last week and said, you got to get your family out because this report has stirred people up and you\'re going to be blamed for it.\xc2\xa0 And he claims it\xe2\x80\x99s put his life in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 What do you say?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I can tell you that the administration has been very focused on ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the necessary steps around the world to ensure the safety of U.S. facilities and personnel around the world.\xc2\xa0 There was an assessment from the intelligence community that we could see acts of violence occur in response to the release of this report.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the administration had put in place a plan that was executed over a number of months to prepare for the day in which this report would be released.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about specific measures that were taken either to protect the security of any individuals or specific individuals or specific American facilities around the globe.\xc2\xa0 But the security risk associated with the release of this report is something that the administration has been mindful of for months now, and we continue to be mindful of it even now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that the other thing you notice that\'s on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule today is a briefing that\'s he\xe2\x80\x99s receiving from his national security team.\xc2\xa0 This is about terror threats around the globe.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President typically does around this time of year, that around the holidays when more people are traveling, that the President gets a full briefing on the terror threats that are -- what we\'re monitoring and, in some cases, even countering around the globe.</p>\n<p>And part of that meeting will be devoted to the ongoing efforts to ensure that our personnel and facilities around the globe are addressing the risk that is posed by the release of this report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 When the report came out, you also said that the practices that were outlined in that report were un-American, the interrogation practices.\xc2\xa0 James Mitchell says that the way it\xe2\x80\x99s been set up by the administration, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has an ability to answer the charges against him -- a terrorist can answer the charges against him.\xc2\xa0 But James Mitchell didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get a chance to respond to the Senate intelligence report -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t call him, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get his side of the story.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort of un-American?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, it does seem to me that Dr. Mitchell has availed himself of a number of American media outlets to make his case, and he certainly is entitled as an American to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a terrorist has rights, and the Senate committee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reach out to him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the Senate committee about whether they talked to him.\xc2\xa0 I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t, frankly, know whether or not they did.\xc2\xa0 If he says that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to contradict him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to anyone at the CIA.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the cromnibus for just a second, because beyond Dodd-Frank and campaign finance there are a number of Democrats who have expressed concern about some other I guess you would call them smaller provisions that retracted guidelines for I guess actually regulations that force a certain number of hours for truckers to sleep; IRS gets less money for enforcement.\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is, is this also part of what the President would see as the kind of compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to get this passed?\xc2\xa0 Or is there sort of a larger issue of process that certainly has been criticized in years past about things getting put in the bill at the last minute?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to the process, the administration -- one of the reasons the administration and the President made the decision to sign this piece of compromise legislation into law is that it does fund the vast majority of the federal government through the end of September.\xc2\xa0 And the process that we have complained about the most over the last several years is that frequently we saw Congress pass a series of stop-gap spending measures that would essentially set up a variety of deadlines that Congress struggled to meet, and that careening from crisis to crisis was something that was not in the best interest of our economy.</p>\n<p>So one element of this legislation, for all its flaws, is that it does endow our economy with a certain level of certainty. Over the course of the next nine months, the government will be funded at levels that are appropriate -- the vast majority of the government will be funded at levels that are appropriate for the successful implementation of the kinds of responsibilities that the government has.</p>\n<p>That said -- and I know you hear this from leaders in both parties in Congress, that we would welcome a return to the more conventional appropriations process, where individual appropriations bills are debated at the subcommittee level of the appropriations committee and advanced through the process in that way -- we certainly would welcome that kind of return.\xc2\xa0 But the process surrounding this omnibus proposal is a significant improvement that will have some significant -- or will at least have some economic benefit for the country because it does lock in these spending levels for the next nine months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The confirmation of Vivek Murphy -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been without a surgeon general for I think about 500 days, and many people see this as just largely a ceremonial role.\xc2\xa0 How does the President view his role in the administration, and would he, for example, have made it possible not to have had Ron Klain come in and be an Ebola czar?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how it would have made a difference in the past.\xc2\xa0 But certainly looking forward, the President is pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have somebody with the kinds of credentials that Dr. Murphy has to communicate with the American public about important public health issues.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Ebola or the Affordable Care Act or getting a shot around flu season, Dr. Murthy is somebody that has the right combination of medical training and communication skills that will serve the country and this administration very well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So kind of a communications/PR role.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that traditionally is the role that\xe2\x80\x99s been filled by the Surgeon General.\xc2\xa0 There are other important responsibilities that he has, but that is certainly one very good example of the way that he can serve the American people in a way that will have health care benefits for people all across the country.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about dropping oil prices.\xc2\xa0 If I\xe2\x80\x99d gotten this from my editor when Jason was here, I would have asked him.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a shot.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House considered stockpiling more oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to take advantage of the falling prices, or do you just think that the falling prices are such an unmitigated positive thing that that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Typically, I get questions about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when the oil prices are really high.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of symmetry associated with you asking it now.\xc2\xa0 I will give a similar answer to the one that I\xe2\x80\x99ve given in the past, in an era of higher oil prices, which is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about any actions that may or may not be under consideration as it relates to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\xc2\xa0 I will note one thing, though -- that the reserve was created to address interruptions in supply and not intended as a way to affect the price of oil on the global market.</p>\n<p>But as it relates to anything that\xe2\x80\x99s under consideration, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that much that I can offer on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you see the falling oil prices as an unmitigated positive?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously it causes disruption to American fracking efforts and things like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the thing that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m no economic expert, Jason is, but I think that even I would conclude, based on hearing Jason speak in public settings like this and in private meetings, that there is nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s ever considered an unmitigated positive when it comes to our economy. And I think that the kinds of decisions, however -- or the kinds of assessments that people like Jason draw, however, are rooted in trying to determine whether the net impact is positive.\xc2\xa0 And I think as Jason made pretty clear in his presentation, he does believe that, on balance, the net impact of these lower oil prices is positive for the U.S. economy and positive for the vast majority of middle-class families in this country.</p>\n<p>Justin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Fed\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today -- Jason obviously got a little shy when we asked him about it, but somebody else in the administration, Labor Secretary Perez, was not as shy when The New York Times asked him about it.\xc2\xa0 He said that -- he was asked if the Fed should move sooner rather than later on raising interest rates -- that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reject that in stronger terms. So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is that the position of the administration, of the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The position of the White House is that we will not comment on Fed policymaking decisions, even ones that are only being contemplated and not yet announced.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the Labor Secretary get over his skis a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the entirety of his remarks so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to evaluate that from here.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody that speaks in public with some frequency and has a pretty good track record of doing so, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to comment in response directly to his comments.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sort of adopt Jason\xe2\x80\x99s strategy here and sort of decline to interfere with the independent process that\xe2\x80\x99s underway at the Federal Reserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask really quickly about the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill.\xc2\xa0 It was something that I know you guys have encouraged Congress to pass, but Tom Coburn blocked it last night.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering both for your reaction, but also since obviously the President and Tom Coburn have a close friendship, and this is an issue that the President has spoken pretty passionately about in the aftermath of things like the Fort Hood shooting, if this was something that they had spoken about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it is.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the White House was pleased to see that the Republican majority in the House joined with Democrats to pass the Clay Hunt suicide prevention for American Veterans Act.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to urge the Senate -- Senator Coburn\xe2\x80\x99s objection notwithstanding -- to do exactly the same thing because of the support that it would offer up to our veterans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is a critical issue, and the President believes that we owe it to our veterans to do everything we can to give them the support and the resources that they need.\xc2\xa0 Ensuring that veterans have access to timely and effective mental health care is a top administration priority.\xc2\xa0 This bill would move us in a step in the right direction, and it complements the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions, to improve mental health care for servicemembers, veterans and their families.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good afternoon.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:58 P.M EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
