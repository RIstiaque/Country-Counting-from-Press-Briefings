ICT</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Your Excellency, President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the leaders of the party state and the people of Vietnam, once again I\'d like to warmly welcome President Barack Obama and the high-level delegation of the U.S. government on your official visit to Vietnam.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. President and I had a very productive talk on bilateral relations, regional and global issues of common interest.\xc2\xa0 We discussed the implementation of the joint statement on Vietnam-U.S. Comprehensive Partnership signed in July 2013, and the Joint Vision Statement between the two countries in July of 2015 concluded between the high-level leaders of the two countries.\xc2\xa0 We agreed that important progress in bilateral relations have been made in recent years.\xc2\xa0 Both sides committed to implementing the principles of respect for each other\'s independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring President Obama\'s official visit, Vietnam and the U.S. agreed to a joint statement on strengthening the comprehensive partnership with added substance, depth, and effectiveness.\xc2\xa0 Both sides agreed to place development cooperation at the center of the bilateral ties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn this occasion, important deals were also reached in terms of trade, health care, humanitarian assistance, education and training, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges, as well.\xc2\xa0 Both sides agreed to give higher priorities to addressing war legacy issues and committed -- continue to work together in this regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. will work with Vietnam on the passing of Bien Hoa Airport after both sides successfully conclude the cleanup project at Danang Airport.\xc2\xa0 Vietnam very much appreciates the U.S. decision to completely lift the ban on lethal weapon sales to Vietnam, which is clear proof that both countries have completely normalized the relations.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama and I also discussed the future direction of bilateral ties and measures to further deepen bilateral cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We underscored the importance of confidence-building and priority for development cooperation in trade and investment, science and technology, human resource development, and addressing climate change.\xc2\xa0 Both sides reaffirmed the commitment to promptly ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, or TPP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to regional and global issues, President Obama and I agreed that we should set up collaboration at regional and international forums, and that the U.S. will support Vietnam in successfully hosting the 2017 APEC Summit, as well as participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also exchanged views on recent developments in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 We reiterated continued cooperation on addressing climate change and sustainable use of the Mekong River water resources.\xc2\xa0 We believe that promised growth in Vietnam-U.S relations not only brings about benefits for each country, but also contributes to peace, stability, cooperation and development in the Asia Pacific and world, and the ASEAN-U.S. relationships as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to thank President Obama personally, the American leadership, and people and American friends for their goodwill and significant contributions to the normalization and the continued development of the Vietnam-U.S. relations.\xc2\xa0 I wish President Obama and the members of your delegation a successful visit to Vietnam with fond memories of our country, culture, and hospitality of the Vietnamese people.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce again, thank you very much for the presence of American and Vietnamese press and media here today.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Xin ch\xc3\xa0o.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, President Quang, for your generous words.\xc2\xa0 And let me thank you and the government and the people of Vietnam for the sincere welcome and hospitality that has been extended to me and to my delegation.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the past century, our two nations have known cooperation and then conflict, painful separation, and a long reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 Now, more than two decades of normalized ties between our governments allows us to reach a new moment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear from this visit that both our peoples are eager for an even closer relationship, a deeper relationship.\xc2\xa0 And I was moved to see so many people lining the streets as we were driving into town today.\xc2\xa0 I bring greetings and friendship of the American people, including some outstanding members of Congress who are joining me on this visit, and so many Vietnamese Americans whose families bind us together and remind us of the values that we share.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ve indicated before that one of my highest foreign policy priorities as President is to ensure that the United States continues to play a larger and long-term role in the Asia Pacific, which is vital to our security and to our prosperity.\xc2\xa0 We believe the people of this region should live in security, prosperity and dignity.\xc2\xa0 In pursuit of this vision, we\xe2\x80\x99re more deeply engaged across the Asia Pacific than we have been in decades, and that includes our Comprehensive Partnership with Vietnam.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you consider where we have been and where we are now, the transformation in the relations between our two countries is remarkable.\xc2\xa0 Over the past two decades, our trade has surged nearly a hundredfold, supporting jobs and opportunities in both countries.\xc2\xa0 Since I took office, we\xe2\x80\x99ve boosted U.S. exports to Vietnam by more than 150 percent.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re now the single largest market for Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s exports.\xc2\xa0 American companies are one of the top investors here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith our Fulbright programs, thousands of our students and scholars have studied together.\xc2\xa0 And more than 13,000 young people across Vietnam are learning new skills as part of our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative.\xc2\xa0 Vietnam has become one of the top 10 countries with students in the United States.\xc2\xa0 This year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve welcomed nearly 19,000 -- the most ever.\xc2\xa0 And last year, Vietnam welcomed nearly half a million American tourists to this country -- and I will assure you that more are on the way.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur two governments are also cooperating more closely than ever.\xc2\xa0 As part of our engagement with ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, we\xe2\x80\x99re working together to advance regional security and stability.\xc2\xa0 Vietnam has welcomed American navy ships to your ports.\xc2\xa0 Our militaries are conducting more exchanges and partnering on maritime security.</p>\n<p>\n\tTogether, we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- not only to support trade, but to draw our nations closer together and reinforce regional cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing more to meet global challenges, from preventing nuclear terrorism to promoting global health security, so that outbreaks of disease don\xe2\x80\x99t become epidemics.\xc2\xa0 And with this visit, the United States and Vietnam have agreed to a significant upgrade in our cooperation across the board.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re taking new steps to give our young people the education and skills that they need to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased that, for the first time, the Peace Corps will come to Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 Our Peace Corps volunteers will focus on teaching English, and the friendship that our people forge will bring us closer together for decades to come.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmerican academic and technology leaders -- including Intel, Oracle, Arizona State University and others -- will help Vietnamese universities boost training in science, technology, engineering and math.\xc2\xa0 Harvard Medical School, Johnson &amp; Johnson, GE and others will join with Vietnam universities to improve medical education.\xc2\xa0 And now that the government of Vietnam has granted the necessary license, we can say that Fulbright University Vietnam -- this country\xe2\x80\x99s first nonprofit, independent university -- can move forward and open its doors and welcome its first class this fall.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re increasing trade.\xc2\xa0 With Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on multiple entry visas, it will be easier for Americans to come here and do business and travel.\xc2\xa0 President Quang and I just attended a signing ceremony that many of you saw, where American and Vietnamese companies are moving ahead with the new commercial deals worth more than $16 billion.\xc2\xa0 Boeing will sell 100 aircraft to VietJet.\xc2\xa0 Pratt &amp; Whitney will sell advanced engines.\xc2\xa0 GE Wind will partner with the Vietnamese government to develop more wind power.\xc2\xa0 Deals like these are a win for both of our countries -- helping to fuel Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth and supporting tens of thousands of American jobs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe agreed to work to ratify and implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership as soon as possible, because it will support vital economic reforms here, further integrate Vietnam into the global economy, and reduce tariffs on American exports to Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 And we discussed the high standards that Vietnam has committed to meet under TPP on labor, the environment and intellectual property.\xc2\xa0 And I conveyed that the United States is prepared to offer technical assistance to Vietnam as it works to fully implement these standards so that TPP delivers the benefits that our peoples expect.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regard to security, the United States will continue to do our part to address the painful legacy of war.\xc2\xa0 On behalf of the American people, including our veterans, I want to thank the government and the people of Vietnam for the many years of cooperation to account for Americans missing in action -- solemn efforts that we\'ll continue together.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to help remove unexploded landmines and bombs.\xc2\xa0 And now that our joint effort to remove dioxin -- Agent Orange -- from Danang Airport is nearly complete, the United States will help in the cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to continue deepening our defense cooperation, including patrol boats and training for Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s Coast Guard, and to work more closely together in responding to humanitarian disasters.\xc2\xa0 And I can also announce that the United States is fully lifting the ban on the sale of military equipment to Vietnam that has been in place for some 50 years.\xc2\xa0 As with all our defense partners, sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights.\xc2\xa0 But this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 It also underscores the commitment of the United States to a fully normalized relationship with Vietnam, including strong defense ties with Vietnam and this region for the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore broadly, the United States and Vietnam are united in our support for a regional order, including in the South China Sea -- where international norms and rules are upheld, where there is freedom of navigation and overflight, where lawful commerce is not impeded, and where disputes are resolved peacefully, through legal means, in accordance with international law.\xc2\xa0 I want to repeat that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, and we will support the right of all countries to do the same.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven as we make important progress in the ways that I\xe2\x80\x99ve just described, there continue to be areas where our two governments disagree, including on democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 And I made it clear that the United States does not seek to impose our form of government on Vietnam or on any nation.\xc2\xa0 We respect Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and independence.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we will continue to speak out on behalf of human rights that we believe are universal, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the right of citizens, through civil society, to organize and help improve their communities and their country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe -- and I believe -- that nations are stronger and more prosperous when these universal rights are upheld, and when our two countries continue to discuss these issues as part of our human rights dialogue in a spirit of constructive and cooperative effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, the United States and Vietnam are expanding our cooperation in ways that benefit the world.\xc2\xa0 Under our growing climate change partnership, we\xe2\x80\x99ll support Vietnam as it works to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement.\xc2\xa0 Because our two countries and others have committed to joining the agreement this year, we\xe2\x80\x99re within striking distance of it entering into force before anybody expected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99ll help communities in vulnerable regions, like the Mekong Delta adapt to a changing climate and assist Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s transition to a low-carbon economy.\xc2\xa0 And that includes the low-carbon energy that will come from our cooperation on civil nuclear power.\xc2\xa0 And as Vietnam prepares to deepen its commitment to U.N. peacekeeping, the United States is proud to support Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s new peacekeeping training center.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, President Quang, thank you for your hospitality. Thank you for our work together.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to the opportunity to visit with the Vietnamese people.\xc2\xa0 Maybe I will enjoy some c\xc3\xa0 ph\xc3\xaa s\xe1\xbb\xafa \xc4\x91\xc3\xa1.\xc2\xa0 I believe that the relationship between the Vietnam people and the United States can be one of the most important in this critical part of the world.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that the upgrade in our ties that we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved today will deliver greater security, prosperity, and dignity for both of our peoples for many decades to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tXin c\xe1\xba\xa3m \xc6\xa1n.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m from the Vietnam News Agency.\xc2\xa0 I have a question for President Quang.\xc2\xa0 Your Excellency, could you advise us and make some comment on the notable advances in Vietnam-U.S. relations over the past two decades?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your question.\xc2\xa0 I want to affirm that over the past two decades, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in July 1995, Vietnam-U.S. relations have made great strides in many fields.\xc2\xa0 In terms of politics and diplomacy, Vietnam and the U.S. are former enemies turned friends.\xc2\xa0 And now we are comprehensive partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe high-level leaders of the two countries often pay a visit to each other, and the relations have grown very well bilaterally and multilaterally.\xc2\xa0 We share the common interests regarding the regional and international issues.\xc2\xa0 And our common interests grow day by day, particularly in relation to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to economic cooperation, I\'m very pleased to inform you that the two-way trade has grown 130-fold to U$S 44.5 billion last year.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. is currently the seventh-largest investor in Vietnam, and I hope that the U.S. will soon become the biggest investor in Vietnam, as Ambassador Ted Osius once mentioned.\xc2\xa0 The bilateral trade between the two countries has enormous potential to grow, particularly once the TPP enters into effect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding education and training cooperation, we have obtained many important progression.\xc2\xa0 Take, for example, the Fulbright University in Vietnam has recently received its operating license.\xc2\xa0 The number of Vietnamese students studying in the U.S. has grown 56-fold to 28,000 students -- the highest number among the ASEAN countries.\xc2\xa0 And our cooperation on defense and security continues to grow in line with the needs of both sides.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cooperation in remedying the war legacy is now growing more substantively.\xc2\xa0 The two countries have recently completed the phase one of environmental cleanup at Danang Airport, and we will continue to implement the second phase of the project at various other sites, including Bien Hoa Airport.\xc2\xa0 Together with the progress in bilateral ties, Vietnam and U.S. are working together and enhancing the collaboration on regional and international issues of common interest in international forums.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe advances in the bilateral relations stems from the fact that we increasingly share common concerns and interests.\xc2\xa0 And both side fully realize the (inaudible) to respect each other\'s independence, sovereignty, political regimes, and legitimate interests.\xc2\xa0 The visit of President Barack Obama this time to Vietnam will surely create stronger momentum for the development and promotion of Vietnam-U.S. relations in the future contributing to maintenance of peace stability, cooperation and development in Asia Pacific and the wider world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question for both Presidents about the lifting of the arms embargo.\xc2\xa0 To what extent do you see the need to build up Vietnam\'s military deterrent against China\'s behavior in the South China Sea as part of this decision?\xc2\xa0 Could this include expanded U.S. access to Vietnamese ports, including Cam Ranh Bay?</p>\n<p>\n\tDirectly for President Obama, to what degree will the U.S. decide on weapons sales based on human rights considerations?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for President Quang, how do you respond to the U.S. push for improved human rights situation in Vietnam?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, Matt, the decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations.\xc2\xa0 It was based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam -- a process that began with some very courageous and difficult conversations decades ago, including led by our current Secretary of State John Kerry, and Senators Tom Carper and John McCain, and a whole bunch of other Vietnam veterans, as well as their counterparts in the Vietnamese government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd over time, what we\'ve seen is a progressive deepening and broadening of the relationship.\xc2\xa0 And what became apparent to me and my administration at this point was, is that given all the work we do together across the spectrum of economic, trade, security and humanitarian efforts, that it was appropriate for us not to have a blanket across-the-board ban.\xc2\xa0 Now, every sale that we make to everybody is viewed as a particular transaction, and we examine what\'s appropriate and what\'s not, and there\'s some very close allies of ours where we may not make a particular sale until we have a better sense of how that piece of equipment may end up being used.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to continue to engage in the case-by-case evaluations of these sales.\xc2\xa0 But what we do not have is a ban that\'s based on an ideological division between our two countries, because we think, at this stage, both sides have established a level of trust and cooperation, including between our militaries, that is reflective of common interests and mutual respect.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, one of the things that happened through this Comprehensive Partnership is a dialogue between the U.S. and Vietnamese military that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen in a very long time.\xc2\xa0 And we already have U.S. vessels that have come here to port.\xc2\xa0 We expect that there will be deepening cooperation between our militaries, oftentimes around how do we respond to humanitarian disasters in this region.\xc2\xa0 There may be occasions in which that means that additional U.S. vessels might visit, but I want to emphasize that we will do so only at the invitation and with the cooperation of the Vietnamese government, fully respecting their sovereignty and their sensitivities.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, there is, I think, a genuine mutual concern with respect to maritime issues between the United States and Vietnam, and I\'ve made no secret of that.\xc2\xa0 Vietnam, along with ASEAN, met at my invitation in Sunnylands, California, and we put forward a very close statement that it is important for us to maintain the freedom of navigation and the governance of international norms and rules and law that have helped to create prosperity and promoted commerce and peace and security in this region.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s my belief that, with respect to the South China Sea -- although the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support any particular claim -- we are supportive of the notion that these issues should be resolved peacefully, diplomatically, in accordance with international rules and norms, and not based on who\'s the bigger party and who can throw their weight around a little bit more.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, as I indicated in my initial statement, the United States is going to continue to fly and set courses for our ships as international law allows.\xc2\xa0 Our hope is that, ultimately, various claimants and various disputes can be resolved, and we\'ll do everything that we can to promote that.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, part of our cooperation with Vietnam is to improve their maritime security posture for a whole host of reasons.\xc2\xa0 But I want to emphasize that my decision to lift the ban really was more reflective of the changing nature of the relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last point, with respect specifically to human rights, as I indicated in my opening statement, this is an area where we still have differences.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been modest progress on some of the areas that we\'ve identified as a concern.\xc2\xa0 TPP actually is one of the things that\'s prompting a series of labor reforms here in Vietnam that could end up being extraordinarily significant.\xc2\xa0 But that is not directly tied to the decision around military sales.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for the question.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make some comments on the human rights cooperation in the general relations between the two countries.\xc2\xa0 Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the consistent position and viewpoint of the Vietnamese state and government is to protect and promote human rights.\xc2\xa0 This is clearly codified and stipulated in the national constitution of Vietnam in 2013.\xc2\xa0 We are now institutionalizing all the regulations into our laws and -- documents to respect and promote the human rights in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the past 30 years of reform in Vietnam, Vietnam has achieved remarkable progress in socioeconomic development, defense and security, especially in protection and promotion of human rights and the rights of every citizen in Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 Those achievements have been highly recognized and officiated by the international community.\xc2\xa0 One of the examples -- very good examples to showcase Vietnam\'s progress, that Vietnam has been elected as a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2016.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs President Obama mentioned earlier, between the two countries, Vietnam and the U.S., we do have some differences in some fields, and it is very easy to understand, particularly on human rights.\xc2\xa0 We are of the view that based on the respect and the spirit of mutual understanding, we need to work closely together and expand our dialogue together.\xc2\xa0 And by so doing, we can narrow the gap in understanding and narrowing the differences between the countries, especially on human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the floor is still open.\xc2\xa0 I invite other questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 You have visited over 50 countries during your term as U.S. President, and Vietnam is among the last ones on the list.\xc2\xa0 So what does that say about the Vietnam-U.S. relation?\xc2\xa0 And how important does the U.S. view Vietnam in its foreign policy?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would have liked to have gotten here sooner.\xc2\xa0 And maybe one of the ways of thinking about it is, we have an expression in the United States -- we save the best for last.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a remarkable country.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a beautiful country.\xc2\xa0 And I told the President that, unfortunately, when I visit, I\'m usually in meetings all day long.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully, when I\'m no longer President, I can come here with my family and I can spend a little more time, and travel the country a little bit more, and get to know the people and eat the food, and have a more relaxing schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the reason I\'m here is because Vietnam is extremely important not just to the region, but I think to the world.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think highlighting the changes that have taken place between our two countries, how just a generation ago we were adversaries and now we are friends, should give us hope, should be a reminder of the ability for us to transform relationships when we have a dialogue that\'s based on mutual interests and mutual respect and people-to-people exchanges.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, Vietnam is a large, vital, growing country in a large, vital, and growing region of the world.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said this before:\xc2\xa0 The Asia Pacific region is growing as fast as any place around the world.\xc2\xa0 It is a young and dynamic region.\xc2\xa0 It is full of entrepreneurial spirit, and you\'re seeing new companies and new jobs being created constantly.\xc2\xa0 So the United States wants to be a part of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we, historically, have had good relations with many countries in this region.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that as Vietnam grows and becomes more prosperous and achieves greater opportunity, that the young people of Vietnam have a chance to partner with the young people of the United States -- trading, exchanging ideas, working on scientific projects, starting businesses together -- because I think that will be good for both countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we think that it is important, from my perspective, that as a leader in ASEAN, that we engage Vietnam bilaterally because we want to continue to strengthen our cooperation with the multilateral organizations like the East Asia Summit and ASEAN where we think we\'ve seen some very real progress over the last several years -- on everything from commercial issues to disease control to humanitarian issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that we increasingly discover is it\'s harder and harder to solve problems by ourselves.\xc2\xa0 It\'s much easier for us to be able to tackle big problems like climate change, or the outbreak of disease, or responding to humanitarian disasters when we have an architecture of cooperation already established.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo on all these fronts, we\'ve seen remarkable progress.\xc2\xa0 The announcements that we\'re making today I think should give people an indication of the next stage of the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship.\xc2\xa0 These are big deals, all the things that we mentioned here today.\xc2\xa0 And it indicates a broader and deeper relationship that I\'m confident will continue to grow in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 President Obama, the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems fairly stalled in Congress, and other countries are looking to follow the U.S. lead in terms of how they advance their approval of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 With the deals today announced for Boeing and GE, and your visit here to Vietnam, are you looking to change your strategy in how you seek approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Congress?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that the agreement should be amended to address currency manipulation?</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, President Obama, can you comment on the killing of Taliban leader, Muhammad Mansour, and on Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s concern about that strike happening on its soil?\xc2\xa0 Can you also comment on whether this signals a new offensive in Afghanistan and whether you\'re concerned that an even more hardline leader might take his place?</p>\n<p>\n\tFor President Quang, are you concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the U.S. Congress and what that means for the deal in the end?\xc2\xa0 And how do you respond to China\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of the U.S. pursuing what China says is a one-sided, selfish agenda in Asia that risks regional peace?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, on TPP, Angela, I haven\'t been around as long as Senator Carper or Secretary Kerry, but I\'ve spent enough time in the Senate to know that every trade deal is painful, because folks are always seeing if they can get an even better deal.\xc2\xa0 And especially when you have multiple parties involved, folks are going to be scrutinizing it, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be debating it, and in an election year, you can anticipate that some folks are going to try to score political points off it.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, I remain confident we\'re going to get it done.\xc2\xa0 And the reason I\'m confident is because it\'s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good for the country.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good for America.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good for the region.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good for the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know I\'ve said this to you before, but let me reiterate:\xc2\xa0 This is the fastest-growing part of the world.\xc2\xa0 This represents an enormous market for the United States.\xc2\xa0 Most countries here already sell their stuff to the United States, and we have relatively low tariffs.\xc2\xa0 In other words, we put relatively low taxes on goods that are coming into the United States.\xc2\xa0 In contrast, tariffs are significantly higher for United States goods being sold here.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo a deal that gets rid of 18,000 taxes on U.S. goods into the largest, fastest-growing markets of the world -- that\'s a good deal for American businesses and American workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber two, one of the biggest complaints about trade deals historically has been that it opens up our markets to countries with lower wages, harsher labor practices, less environmental regulation.\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\'re signing up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you are making commitments that are enforceable to raise labor standards, to ensure that workers have a voice to attend to environmental problems.\xc2\xa0 And so this gives us the ability to engage with a country like Vietnam and work with them on all those fronts -- the precise things that people, in the past, have been concerned about when it comes to trading with other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I have not yet seen a credible argument that once we get TPP in place we\'re going to be worse off.\xc2\xa0 We are demonstrably better off.\xc2\xa0 American workers and American businesses are better off if we get this deal passed.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident we will get it passed.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the politics of it will be noisy.\xc2\xa0 That was true when I, for example, inherited the Korea Free Trade Agreement, or the Colombia and Panamanian Free Trade Agreements when I came into office.\xc2\xa0 But we got them done.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident that we\'ll get them done this time, as well, although there will be ups and downs and bumps along the way.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to currency manipulation, we have provisions in TPP that advance the transparency and reporting functions that allow us to monitor whether we think that currency manipulation is taking place.\xc2\xa0 One of the debates that took place -- and there have been some who argue that we should have enforceable provisions that if you see a currency going down too far that we should be able to impose tariffs on that country.\xc2\xa0 The problem is, is that it\'s very hard to sort out sometimes why a currency is going down and whether it\'s actually being manipulated.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, for us to bind other countries to commitments about their monetary policy would mean we were also binding our Federal Reserve to the claims of other countries in terms of how it implements our monetary policy, and that\'s not something that we would do.\xc2\xa0 We would not give up sovereignty with respect to our monetary policy in that way.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we have strengthened a number of the provisions that are already contained in TPP that will allow us to put on notice folks who we think are engaging in competitive devaluations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, on the Taliban leader, Mr. Mansour.\xc2\xa0 It has been confirmed that he is dead.\xc2\xa0 And he is an individual who, as head of the Taliban, was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who were there as part of the mission that I\'ve set to be able to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance and training to the Afghan military forces there.\xc2\xa0 So this does not represent a shift in our approach.\xc2\xa0 We are not reentering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 Our job is to help Afghanistan secure its own country, not to have our men and women in uniform engage in that fight for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, where we have a high-profile leader who has been consistently part of operations and plans to potentially harm U.S. personnel, and who has been resistant to the kinds of peace talks and reconciliation that ultimately could bring an end to decades of war in Afghanistan, then it is my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief not to stand by, but to make sure that we send a clear signal to the Taliban and others that we\'re going to protect our people.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly the message that has been sent.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Let me respond to this question concerning the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- TPP.\xc2\xa0 In our view, TPP is a significant trade and economic linkage, contributing to sustaining the dynamism and the role as a driver for economic growth in our country, as well as in the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 And for Vietnam, TPP and Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s participation in TPP is one step undertaken by the Vietnamese government in our process of extensive international integration.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, sorry to interrupt.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not getting a translation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tINTERPRETER:\xc2\xa0 Testing one, two, three.\xc2\xa0 Can you hear, Mr. President?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Because I\'m sure that he was saying something very wise and important, and we want to make sure that we all heard it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 So I am glad to add that Vietnam, together with other TPP countries, have been making efforts to narrow differences, to promote cooperation in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual respect.\xc2\xa0 And we try to reduce differences in a spirit of constructiveness and understanding, and paying attention to one another\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interests.\xc2\xa0 And the finalization of TPP is also the successful outcomes of all 12 members of the TPP, rather than any individual effort.\xc2\xa0 And we are prepared to ratify TPP, and we stand ready to implement all the commitments under TPP.</p>\n<p>\n\tMODERATOR:\xc2\xa0 Your Excellency, now we have a technical problem with the translation system.\xc2\xa0 So, Mr. President -- President Quang, could you please repeat again your answer?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Yes, I want to redirect my comments on TPP. \xc2\xa0In our view, the TPP is a very significant trade and economic linkage contributing to the sustainment of dynamism and the role as a driver of economic growth in Asia Pacific region.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for Vietnam, TPP is a one step forward in implementation of the country\xe2\x80\x99s deep and comprehensive international integration policy, which aims at promoting the national economic growth of Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 Vietnam has worked together with other member countries to narrow the differences in the spirit of constructiveness, understanding, and playing new attention to one another\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interests.\xc2\xa0 The finalization of TPP is also the result of the endeavors from 12 members of the agreement, rather than the individual effort of any single country.\xc2\xa0 And Vietnam is now very actively promoting and accelerating the ratification of the TPP, and Vietnam is committed to fully implementing all the policies and provisions of the TPP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMODERATOR:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, President Tr\xe1\xba\xa7n \xc4\x90\xe1\xba\xa1i Quang, and President Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLadies and gentlemen, with that, I declare the press conference adjourned.\xc2\xa0 And please stay in the room for the departure of the two Presidents.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:44 P.M.
