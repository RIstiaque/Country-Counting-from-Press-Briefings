EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Remember this?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the record, Jay Carney is holding up a sign that says \xe2\x80\x9cCongress To-Do List.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a handy pocket-sized graphic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it because you need a reminder?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s because Congress needs a reminder.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder to you that that\xe2\x80\x99s our focus this week on the economy, is the need for Congress to act on these items on its \xe2\x80\x9cTo-Do\xe2\x80\x9d list to reward American jobs, not outsourcing; refinancing for responsible homeowners; tax credits for small business jobs; clean energy manufacturing; and veterans job corps.\xc2\xa0 Those are the items on the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTo-Do\xe2\x80\x9d list for Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I get started with your questions I wanted to note that today the White House announced a new executive order, making it a continuing obligation of our government to scrutinize rules on the books to see if they really make sense -- the five final rules that will save nearly $6 billion in the next five years by eliminating outdated requirements and unjustified costs; a report from the Council of Economic Advisers examining the regulatory look-back that President Obama ordered in 2011.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think this is an important and underreported fact that the President has been extremely aggressive in ordering his administration in an unprecedented way to look back at regulations, eliminate those that are no longer necessary, reduce the burden of those that need to stay on the books but can be adjusted so that the burdens are reduced.\xc2\xa0 And that has produced significant savings, and the President wants that effort to keep up.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, as we make our way to the great state of Washington, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, today the Obama campaign put out a web video that\xe2\x80\x99s attacking Romney on his stance on rights for same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 Given that the President just came around on this, on the issue of gay marriage yesterday, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that seem hypocritical and politically motivated more than anything?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the campaign to talk about ads or videos that they put out.\xc2\xa0 The President noted in his interview when it came up yesterday with Robin Roberts of ABC, that his opponent, Governor Romney, has a starkly different view of these issues, and a starkly different view of the policy issues, even prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement yesterday that he had come to the conclusion that he personally supports same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>\n\tGovernor Romney is for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would enshrine discrimination into our founding legal document.\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 So their positions were starkly different before yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The campaign or the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you want to ask the campaign about its tactics I think you ought to ask the campaign about its tactics.\xc2\xa0 The President was very clear in his interview with Robin Roberts about what his personal beliefs are.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s record on these issues of supporting LGBT rights is long and impressive and clear, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to fight to expand and protect the rights of all American citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whom -- after he gave his interview, to whom has the President spoken personally, both on the gay advocacy side, and also perhaps on the other side in terms of any religious leaders or people who might want to get an explanation from him about his stance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations of the President to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 The President had quite a busy day yesterday, and it continued to be busy after his interview.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you suspect that at any point he would just point that out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t predict on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President excited to talk about this issue tonight now that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing a fundraiser in California among probably a lot of people who are very supportive of gay marriage?\xc2\xa0 This is sort of the first chance he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to talk about it since revealing his view.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has always been clear about his support for LGBT rights and the actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken, including repealing "don\'t ask, don\'t tell"; the fact that he has long opposed the Defense of Marriage Act; the fact that he and the Attorney General, and therefore the administration, have deemed Section 3 of DOMA to be unconstitutional, and therefore the decision not to continue to defend it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus, as I think he also said yesterday in his interview, has been and will continue to be on jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been the -- creating greater security for a middle class in this country that has been under stress for a long time, even predating the Great Recession, has been number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 It was his number-one priority when he ran for office, for this office, and it has been his priority since he took the oath of office.\xc2\xa0 And I think you will hear him focus on those issues just as he has -- going forward, just as he has in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he move to repeal DOMA officially, and have pro-gay marriage language in the Democratic national platform?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, party platform issues are for the party to decide.\xc2\xa0 That process is underway, and I refer you to the DNC on the question about the platform.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that DOMA ought to be repealed is well stated.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the status of the legislative efforts aimed at repeal, but the President certainly supports that and has for quite a long time.\xc2\xa0 I would note that he opposed DOMA back in 1996 and has opposed it ever since.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not repeal it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He believes it should be repealed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he push to repeal to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said it every time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on the Defense of Marriage Act.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not\xe2\x80\x9d question, it\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cyes, we know\xe2\x80\x9d answer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President is saying that this is a -- and the White House is saying this is a states\xe2\x80\x99 issue now.\xc2\xa0 But will the President be outspoken when these issues come up in states about whether they should pass or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what he may say or statements he might issue.\xc2\xa0 He has on occasion made his position known on actions by individual states, most recently in North Carolina, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that continues to be the case.\xc2\xa0 That will continue to be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict when that will take place or with regards to what state issue.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it is a matter for the states.\xc2\xa0 He personally believes that gay and lesbian Americans ought to be able to -- who are in committed, loving relationships ought to be able to marry.\xc2\xa0 But he also -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note -- is respectful of those who disagree.\xc2\xa0 He, after all, traveled some distance to reach this personal decision, and he understands that the whole country has been considering this issue and struggling with it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a remarkable evolution in the broader public with regards to LGBT rights in general, and specifically with regards to same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if he respects people on the other side, why go after Romney?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can respect somebody and strongly disagree.\xc2\xa0 And he absolutely disagrees with efforts to -- this is the distinction, Jim:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s respectful of those who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him on same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 He vehemently disagrees with those who would act to deny Americans\xe2\x80\x99 rights or act to take away rights that have been established in states.\xc2\xa0 And that has been his position for quite a long time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President disappointed in Russian President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to go ahead and go up to G8?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel is it a setback in any sort of significant way for what could be accomplished there?\xc2\xa0 And are you satisfied with the explanation about other business in Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a number of questions, but the broad answer is no, we\xe2\x80\x99re not disappointed.\xc2\xa0 The President and President Putin had a very good conversation.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to meeting with Prime Minister Medvedev at the G8 and looks forward to meeting -- his first meeting with President Putin in one month.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if it will be a long time before they do actually get a chance to meet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Putin was just sworn into office and is obviously forming a government, and the President absolutely understands that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But President Putin knew he was going to be sworn into office around this time, and that meeting in the Oval Office has been on the books for some time.\xc2\xa0 So was it a surprise at all that he said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming?\xc2\xa0 Does it feel like a snub?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was not a surprise, and it does not at all feel like a snub.\xc2\xa0 It was something we understood and understand.\xc2\xa0 And again, the President will be meeting with President Putin in one month, which is not much time at all.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to that meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did it have anything to do with the possibility of Obama not going to the summit in Russia in the fall?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on Syria -- the breakout of further violence there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As we always do, we strongly condemn the attacks in Damascus.\xc2\xa0 And we -- just make sure I get the language right here, we -- one second.\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, folks.\xc2\xa0 There we go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAttacks like these that result in the indiscriminate killing and injury of civilians are reprehensible and cannot be justified.\xc2\xa0 They also remind us of the urgent necessity of achieving a political solution before it is too late.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it make it harder to sustain a coalition against Assad, to pressure Assad, if you\'re having -- like the other side adopting terror tactics?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do not believe this this kind of attack that you saw in Damascus is representative of the opposition.\xc2\xa0 There are clearly extremist elements in Syria, as we have said all along, who are trying to take advantage of the chaos in that country, chaos brought about by Assad\'s brutal assault on his own people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is Assad needs to abide by his commitments to comply with the ceasefire, to comply with the Kofi Annan plan to withdraw his forces.\xc2\xa0 We are very skeptical about his willingness to do that.\xc2\xa0 We have seen very little evidence about -- that suggests he will comply.\xc2\xa0 But we support that plan because it has brought about some decrease in violence, and because it will help lay the foundation for a political transition that will take place eventually.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you -- real quickly, could you talk to us about the President\'s relationship with George Clooney?\xc2\xa0 Does he expect to have any time with him alone today to discuss any policy matters?\xc2\xa0 What does he feel that George Clooney brings in terms of the President\'s ability to get out his message either to donors or to supporters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the campaign for questions specifically about the campaign.\xc2\xa0 The President has met with Mr. Clooney on some of the issues that he cares deeply about, in particular the Darfur region in Sudan.\xc2\xa0 And the President appreciates the work that George Clooney has done on those issues.\xc2\xa0 And as is the case with all those who have supported his campaign, the President is very appreciative of Mr. Clooney\xe2\x80\x99s support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on tomorrow, four years ago, Nevada was suffering from the recession -- housing foreclosures, construction workers out of work.\xc2\xa0 The President was able to take advantage of that politically as well.\xc2\xa0 You go back, four years later, the situation is still pretty dire in Nevada.\xc2\xa0 Is the President hurting in Nevada?\xc2\xa0 Or does he recognize that the state is in some real straits?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President absolutely recognizes that Nevada was hit extremely hard by the bursting of the housing bubble and by the crisis that befell the nation in 2008, causing the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Again, questions about his political standing, I would refer you to the campaign for answers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will focus tomorrow on the need for Congress to take up his refinance initiative to allow homeowners to have access to these historically low interest rates, to refinance their homes, to free up some capital, and ease some of the financial burden that they have endured.\xc2\xa0 This is an important step that would benefit Americans in Nevada, but Americans across the country in states like Nevada that were very hard-hit, but across the country.\xc2\xa0 And it is inexcusable for Congress to not take action on a measure like this that should garner bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly hopes that Congress will act on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Four years ago, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have responsibility for what had happened there.\xc2\xa0 But four years later, doesn\'t he bear responsibility for the continued problems in the state?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think this President has been very clear about his responsibility, which is to do everything he can, both working with Congress and acting with his administrative authority, to help the economy grow and to help it create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen he took office, we were in the worst economic free fall of our lifetimes, and we were only about halfway through the fall, as you remember.\xc2\xa0 The fourth quarter of 2008 saw the economy shrink, we now know, by almost 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 In January of 2009, when the President was sworn in, the economy lost roughly 800,000 jobs in that month alone.\xc2\xa0 Since the President\'s policies have been able to take effect, as I think is demonstrated in my handy-dandy insert that I had moments ago, you\'ve seen a dramatic reversal in the trend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHere is the last year of the previous administration -- a downward spiral in terms of jobs; hemorrhaging jobs.\xc2\xa0 President Obama takes office -- steady growth.\xc2\xa0 Out of the hole, and then beginning to create jobs -- 26 straight months of private sector job creation.\xc2\xa0 We are not there yet.\xc2\xa0 The recession was hideously deep and its effects profound across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact of the matter is, because of the policies that this President pursued, sometimes, against the advice of political observers, the economy has turned around, it is growing, it is moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 It has created jobs for 26 straight months.\xc2\xa0 It has been -- the GDP has been growing for 11 straight quarters, and we need to continue that work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, among other things, made a decision that was viewed as hugely politically risky to take action to ensure that General Motors and Chrysler were not liquidated and that a million or more jobs were not lost.\xc2\xa0 He took that action and now GM and Chrysler are in many ways stronger than they\'ve ever been, and GM is once again the largest car manufacturer in the world.\xc2\xa0 Others would have made a different choice, regardless of what they now say in an attempt at revisionist history.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Others" meaning Mitt Romney?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly Governor Romney has -- but many others took the position that Governor Romney did in opposition to the actions that the President took.\xc2\xa0 It is comical to assert that a plan that called for private investment rather than government assistance to save GM and Chrysler could have worked, because as all of you know, nobody was out there willing to help finance the managed bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf President Obama had not acted, GM and Chrysler would no longer exist.\xc2\xa0 And that is a simple fact.\xc2\xa0 It is widely recognized across the region that is so central to the production of American automobiles.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Governor Romney saying he should take credit for the auto rescue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the interview the President gave yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He was asked about this by Robin Roberts, and gave an answer that I could not improve on, although I just tried to moments ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you guys in a statement yesterday talked about the agenda for the NATO meeting.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what will be on the agenda for the G8?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is an important meeting every year.\xc2\xa0 There continues to be matters of global economic importance that are on the agenda as well as national security issues.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you with a further preview.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we know that the President issued a statement after the results in Indiana the other night, but has he actually spoken with Senator Lugar?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us anything about that conversation if it\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xc2\xa0 And then also, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get a gaggle tomorrow, can you give us any kind of week ahead now -- or weekend ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a week ahead or weekend ahead for you.\xc2\xa0 I will ensure that one of my colleagues provides that to you tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement regarding Senator Lugar speaks for itself, and his disappointment I think is clear from that statement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator Lugar has served this country admirably for many, many years.\xc2\xa0 And as a personal matter, the President appreciates the collegiality that Senator Lugar offered to him when he was first coming in as a senator and the wisdom that Senator Lugar brought to bear on all the issues of national security that he worked on.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the President has said, the President\xe2\x80\x99s very high priority initiative of securing nuclear weapons around the world has been very much guided by the work that Senator Lugar has done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you imagine a role for him, if there were a second term, in this Cabinet or his administration or on the commission?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from talking about personnel decisions like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said that they have not talked.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will have to check on whether or not the President and Senator Lugar have talked.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us -- did he mention anything this morning at all about how he felt about the announcement yesterday or the impact it\xe2\x80\x99s having so far?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out internal discussions, but I think the President was glad to have the opportunity that he had yesterday to speak to the country about his views on this matter and about the journey he\xe2\x80\x99s traveled on it -- about the profound importance of equality, about the underlying principle that guided him as he came to this decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe cited the Golden Rule and the need to treat others as you would have them treat you.\xc2\xa0 He spoke about sort of the three areas that affected him as he was dealing with this and thinking about it:\xc2\xa0 conversations with friends and family and staff members, some of whom are in committed same-sex relationships.\xc2\xa0 The effect that conversations he had with members of our armed services during the fight to repeal \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And certainly his observation of and consideration of the various ways that states have been grappling with this issue, which he spoke about during his interview.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think those -- all of those went into the process for him -- a process that was a very personal one, as he discussed yesterday in his interview.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President came to that conclusion?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we know he said to Robin Roberts in their interview that he had already decided to publicly take this position.\xc2\xa0 So did he come to the conclusion weeks ago, months ago?\xc2\xa0 When was that evolution complete?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date for you.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, this was a very -- this was not a policy debate within the White House or the administration.\xc2\xa0 This was a personal decision about his personal views.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that within the last several months he had come to the decision that he talked about yesterday and had concluded that he wanted to convey his views on this to the American people sometime in the next several weeks or months.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be this week, but because of the considerable focus on the issue this week, the President decided it might as well be this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What effect did your -- the grilling you got Monday at the briefing have on his sense of expediting this?\xc2\xa0 Did he say anything to you about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- part of my job, and I think it reinforced the fact that this had become an issue that was getting a great deal of attention and focus, but certainly not about me.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:07 A.M.
