(Local)</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 This is SAOs, so everyone knows -- SAOs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think you heard the Vice President talk about the importance of the relationship on a whole variety of dimensions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking a lot about the security dimensions during his visit, but of course a very important piece of the agenda is on economic and trade issues.\xc2\xa0 And maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the Vice President talk about how we have a stake in each other\xe2\x80\x99s success, about the need for practical cooperation that helps demonstrate to the American people and also to the Chinese people that this relationship is working, that this kind of a visit is generating and advancing the kind of cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do across the board, but especially in the economic and trade space.</p>\n<p>And in the course of this visit and during the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings, we\xe2\x80\x99re working on a number of issues on energy, on climate, on food and drug safety.\xc2\xa0 Coming out of these discussions, coming out of some discussions on the sidelines of the visit, we reached agreement on a number of things that my colleague will be able to outline in detail both what they are and the significance of them as you see in the fact sheet.</p>\n<p>But I guess the sort of broader point or just the sort of context-setting point is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking a lot on this visit about the ADIZ issue, about some of the security issues in the relationship, but I just sort of want to make the broader point that this is -- that this set of issues is actually a very big piece of business here.\xc2\xa0 And we are constantly trying to use visits like this to advance our agenda on a whole number of aspects.\xc2\xa0 And the economic and trade one is the way that we used part of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s time, but also in some of the discussions leading up to this visit.</p>\n<p>And this will continue past the visit.\xc2\xa0 We have our Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, which is where we have our top economic and trade negotiators getting together in just a week or so.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue that.\xc2\xa0 And the Vice President talked about some things with his Chinese counterparts that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to continue to work on over the course of the coming days and weeks.</p>\n<p>So why don\xe2\x80\x99t I turn to my colleague to talk a little bit about what we are announcing today.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 So just to start off on the climate side obviously is the two largest emitters -- we have a special responsibility and opportunity working together.\xc2\xa0 And today, we reaffirmed the agreements on the HFCs that the two presidents had reached in Sunnylands originally, and expanded in St. Petersburg.\xc2\xa0 We also reached agreement that China would work with us to design and then implement much more aggressive emissions controls and standards for vehicles -- low-sulfur fuel and vehicle emissions, known as the China VI standards, which is the first time that they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to that.</p>\n<p>We also reached agreement that there would be effort and resources devoted on both sides to the work of the energy -- the climate -- sorry, the climate working group that was set up, as my colleague mentioned, at the S&amp;ED.\xc2\xa0 And there were five areas in that to be looked at by that working group.\xc2\xa0 And it was agreed today that we would make significant progress, concrete progress by the next S&amp;ED, which is in the summer of 2014.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s really giving a push forward to that work.</p>\n<p>We also agreed to work together in the UNFCCC negotiations and to work in close cooperation and leader-level discussions.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re, as you know, moving towards the 2015 COP in Paris of the UNFCCC, so this is going to be a very important period going forward in the multilateral -- in those multilateral negotiations.</p>\n<p>On energy transparency, China agreed today to make important steps towards greater transparency by providing more complete and more frequent data releases on their energy situation -- production, consumption and stocks -- and to have stronger cooperation with this process called JODI, J-O-D-I, which is the Joint Organizations Data Initiative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, we reached agreement to information -- to cooperate basically on the management of strategic petroleum reserves with annual meetings and information exchanges.\xc2\xa0 We also -- China agreed to participate in a peer review of fossil-fuel subsidies, which is the next step in the implementation of the G20 commitment to phase out, and they reaffirmed the commitment to phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies.\xc2\xa0 This is all consistent with their move towards better pricing of energy.</p>\n<p>And finally, on energy, they agreed -- China agreed to\xc2\xa0 -- we agreed to work with them to open up their shale gas to investment and development.</p>\n<p>And then on the food and drug safety and innovation, we import a lot of food from China now and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for both parties that this should be safe, and we have some FDA inspectors on the ground in China, but not enough.\xc2\xa0 And China today agreed to increase the number -- increase the visas supplied for these inspectors, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll reach agreement in January 2014 on how that will be operationalized.\xc2\xa0 But I know that the FDA will be very pleased.</p>\n<p>We also reached an important agreement on things called APIs, which are these bulk chemicals that can be used in drug manufacture.\xc2\xa0 And China agreed to begin to develop a framework for -- a regulatory framework for these chemical compounds.\xc2\xa0 And there will be more work on that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an important step forward in drug safety.</p>\n<p>And then finally, on innovation, is this issue about patents for pharmaceuticals, that as technologies change, manufacturers want to add elements to patents.\xc2\xa0 And there was -- China affirmed that this kind of development of patents would be possible now, which supports drug innovation and will be an important win for our industry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the main items in those buckets.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask a very general question about TPP that just sort of interests me.\xc2\xa0 Did you get any sense from your conversations that the Chinese are viewing TPP less as a competing regional trade pact than as something that they might find attractive down the road?\xc2\xa0 In other words, has their sentiment toward TPP evolved?\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence of that?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t cover that in our discussions here.\xc2\xa0 There have been statements beforehand, in the recent past, about -- and I think you see in the region more interest, more openness to TPP, obviously with Korea\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of interest and some other countries.\xc2\xa0 So I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s some prospect that there\xe2\x80\x99s more growing acceptance that TPP will be an open architecture agreement that will provide rules and standards for the whole region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you guys get into any of the issues, kind of escalating concerns about WTO disputes that both had with each other on trade enforcement?\xc2\xa0 That would be one.\xc2\xa0 And second, since this was a pretty large portfolio being laid out, did you guys consider the sort of old model of what Ron Brown or Al Gore used to do of bringing either business leaders on the trip or NGO leaders?\xc2\xa0 This is a very sizable portfolio, but the constituencies that often were part of these sorts of delegations weren\xe2\x80\x99t on this trip.\xc2\xa0 Had that been part of any calculation?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, first of all, the Vice President spoke to a large --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 -- the AM Cham, the U.S.-China Business Council, two of the main business groups --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have, like, the CEO of GE or the CEO of Mylan, or who all are going to benefit from a lot of these -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not critiquing, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if it had\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not that important, but --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I guess I would just say that, I mean, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the delegation that we had on this trip.\xc2\xa0 The focus of these three areas that we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of working on really are sort of focused on regulatory and policy issues with China, and between China and the United States, that will obviously have an impact on our companies trying to do business in China, trying to improve this as --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the WTO disputes?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 On that, I would say in the discussions that the Vice President had during this trip, he raised a whole range of economic concerns that we have, as well as talked about opportunities for economic cooperation.\xc2\xa0 So the kinds of issues we just made -- we reached agreement on, are the kinds of things that were talked about in the meetings.\xc2\xa0 He also raised a number of other issues and concerns that we have across a range of issues, many of which he talked about in his speech, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t really repeat those.\xc2\xa0 But he talked about interest-rate liberalization, he talked about concerns we have around the WTO and some of the specific cases that we have concerns about.\xc2\xa0 He talked about some of the third plenum reforms that are suggesting things may be going in a positive direction, but the need to speed up implementations.</p>\n<p>So that was a kind of type of issues that he was talking about in the economic area across the meetings over the last couple of days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on that point, because it interested me in the briefing last night, it sounded like Xi laid out this very ambitious agenda, but said a lot of this won\xe2\x80\x99t really be feasible for 10 or 20 years, and the Vice President said, well, we need things that happen in the here and now.\xc2\xa0 Is that a question of selecting reforms that can be done immediately, or is he just simply saying to the President, you have to move faster, you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect us to wait 10 or 20 years?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a number of different areas that they talked about in terms of -- in the context of the third plenum reforms, both what Xi indicated he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on, but also some of the longstanding concerns that we have that the Vice President raised and discussed in his meetings with Xi and other Chinese leaders about some of the areas of reform, the concerns that we have and what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see going forward.</p>\n<p>In terms of the pace, obviously some of the issues on the agenda are large, structural changes that they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make in terms of rebalancing their economy that are pretty fundamental issues that are going to obviously take a long time to develop.\xc2\xa0 But I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to my colleagues as well on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out here is an example of the kinds of here-and-now issues that not only address specific concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to resolve today, but also connect to the larger structural issues that they were discussing in these meetings.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a linkage between the kinds of issues we\xe2\x80\x99re raising, the kinds of issues we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to resolve, the type of cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking, and the larger reform agenda that the two leaders were discussing in their meetings.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I agree with that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that I mentioned in the area of energy and climate, and the fossil-fuel subsidy review, and the vehicle-emission standards, part of that is support for the kind of shift in their economy that they\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out and that they want to do, and there are areas where we can work together on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To dovetail on Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question, the Vice President talked in this trip about the third plenum reforms really being things that the United States would like to see.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing the kind of commitment by China to make political reforms that the United States perhaps would like to see.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration think that the economic reforms can be carried out without political reforms happening at the same time?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, on that I would just point you to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s speech today, where I think he actually spoke directly to that connection and that issue.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go beyond what he said today, because I think he actually laid it out quite well.\xc2\xa0 He talked about the reform agenda, he talked about the kinds of things that have been laid out in the third plenum.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about whether one can be done without the other.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I would go to what he said, because he actually -- I thought he spoke pretty directly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question is, during the debt ceiling debate, Chinese government and central bank authorities began to sort of publicly criticize U.S. policy and responsibilities over the reserve currency status of the dollar.\xc2\xa0 Did that kind of thing come up?\xc2\xa0 Or was that a momentary impulse during the debt ceiling debate, and given the spate of things that you guys work on, that Chinese economic authorities didn\xe2\x80\x99t continue that complaint about the dollar and sort of responsible management of it?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there was general agreement that both economies were doing well, and there was notice that -- the Chinese noticed that our economy was growing, and unemployment was coming down, although of course we have more work to do.\xc2\xa0 So the other issue did not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) tone --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s interesting.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t7:00 P.M.
