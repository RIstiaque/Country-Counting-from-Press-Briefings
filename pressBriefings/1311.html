EDT<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions, a few on WikiLeaks.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction once he heard about the leaking --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I remember talking to the President sometime last week after discussions with news organizations that these stories were coming.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think our reaction to this type of material, a breach of federal law, is always the same, and that is whenever you have the potential for names and for operations and for programs to be out there in the public domain, that it -- besides being against the law -- has a potential to be very harmful to those that are in our military, those that are cooperating with our military, and those that are working to keep us safe.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, was he personally angered by this?\xc2\xa0 Did he demand answers or an investigation?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is an ongoing investigation that predated the end of last week into leaks of highly classified secret documents. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that the documents raise doubts about whether Pakistan is a reliable partner in fighting terrorism?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand a few things about the documents.\xc2\xa0 Based on what we\'ve seen, I don\'t think that what is being reported hasn\xe2\x80\x99t in many ways been publicly discussed either by you all or by representatives of the U.S. government for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 We have certainly known about safe havens in Pakistan; we have been concerned about civilian casualties for quite some time -- and on both of those aspects we\'ve taken steps to make improvements.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think just the last time General Petreaus testified in front of the Senate there was a fairly robust discussion about the historical relationships that have been had between the Taliban and Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence services.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no doubts about Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s trustworthiness or reliability?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, look, I think the President was clear back in March of 2009 that there was no blank check for Pakistan, that Pakistan had to change the way it dealt with us, it had to make progress on safe havens.\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the Pakistanis because we certainly saw last year those extremists that enjoy the safe haven there turning their eye on innocent Pakistanis.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Pakistan make progress in moving against extremists in Swat and in South Waziristan. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, even as they make progress, we understand that the status quo is not acceptable and that we have to continue moving this relationship in the right direction.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more quickly on this.\xc2\xa0 What do you think this says about the ability of the government to protect confidential information if a breach like this can occur?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there is no doubt that this is a concerning development in operational security.\xc2\xa0 And as we said earlier, it is -- it poses a very real and potential threat to those that are working hard every day to keep us safe.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you quickly about Congressman Rangel and the ethics charges that he faces.\xc2\xa0 Is it the preference of the White House that he reach a deal and put this behind him, put it behind --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben, I don\'t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on the WikiLeaks.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you worried that will be a distraction if it carries on to September?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- let me get some information on that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the WikiLeaks, one of the questions that this raises is whether it makes sense for the United States to continue to give billions of dollars of aid to Pakistan if they are helping the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\'s a concern and what you think.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I said a minute ago, on March 27, 2009, the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter years of mixed results we will not and cannot provide a blank check.\xc2\xa0 Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I am not going to stand here on July the 26th and tell you that all is well.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you that we have made progress in moving this relationship forward; in having the Pakistanis, as I said earlier, address the issue of safe havens, the issue of extremists operating in the country by undertaking operations, again, in Swat and in South Waziristan -- because over the course of the past more than year and a half, what the Pakistanis have found is that the extremists that once enjoyed complete save haven in parts of their country now threaten their country.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken steps.\xc2\xa0 We want to continue to work with them to take more steps.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We understand that we are in this region of the world because of what happened on 9/11; that ensuring that there is not a safe haven in Afghanistan by which attacks against this country and countries around the world can be planned.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re there and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make progress on this relationship.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A blank check is one thing, but is there enough progress there to justify the aid that is being given to them?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, look, we -- I think it was -- even if you look at some of the comments the Secretary of State made just last week in Pakistan, our criticism has been relayed both publicly and privately and we will continue to do so in order to move this relationship forward.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you\xe2\x80\x99re unhappy about the leak, but could you talk about how that part of the issue was characterized in the memos and whether you think it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s role.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I would point you to -- as I said a minute ago, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that what is being said or what is being reported isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been discussed fairly publicly, again, by named U.S. officials and in many news stories.\xc2\xa0 I mean, The New York Times had a story on this topic in March of 2009 written by the same authors.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shifting gears, I also want to ask you where things stand with the consumer regulator decision.\xc2\xa0 How soon is the President going to make a decision?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the timeline from last week in which I said I did not think that things were immediate. I know that the President will look at this job and at several other jobs that are created as part of this legislation and make an announcement.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what criteria is he going to be looking at?\xc2\xa0 I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk publicly about the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates, but --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a number of -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about here and with many of you on the phone, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got many good candidates.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think if you look back at the reason that the President and the team wanted to create a bureau that dealt with consumer issues, because even as we look back at the debate and look back at the issues that were involved in this debate, most people\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with the financial system is not on a Wall Street trading level.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in getting a loan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in getting the capital to create or expand a small business to buy a home.\xc2\xa0 And I think ensuring that there are protections for those on Main Street in order to interact on a daily basis with the financial system are tremendously important.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to Warren going to be weighed in the decision-making process?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said this last week and I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat it again. I think Elizabeth Warren is a terrific candidate.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any criticism in any way by anybody would disqualify her and I think she is very confirmable for this job.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert back on WikiLeaks.\xc2\xa0 A couple of times now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the last couple of moments that a lot of this information is not really new, that named U.S. government officials have said some of this same information publicly.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s -- yes, I said there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any new revelations in the material. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how does it harm national security if we\xe2\x80\x99ve known this already?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the content as much as it is their names, their operations, there\xe2\x80\x99s logistics, there are sources -- all of that information out in a public way has the potential, Ed, to do harm.\xc2\xa0 If somebody is cooperating with the federal government and their name is listed in an action report, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a stretch to believe that that could potentially put a group or an individual at great personal risk.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is part of the concern as well that this is going to embarrass government officials because maybe the war in Afghanistan is a lot worse off than this administration and the previous administration let on?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Ed, that\'s why I would go back to my first point, which is in terms of broad revelations, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any that we see in these documents.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s understand this -- when you talk about the way the war is going in Afghanistan, the documents purportedly cover from I think January of 2004 to December 2009. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nI can\'t speak for the conduct of that war from an operational perspective for most of that time.\xc2\xa0 I do know that when the President came into office in 2009, he, in the first few months, ordered an increase in the number of out troops -- having spent two years talking about how our efforts in Afghanistan were greatly under-resourced -- increased resources and troops to provide security for an election, and then, as you well know, conducted a fairly comprehensive and painstaking review of our policy, which resulted in December 1, 2009\xe2\x80\x99s speech about a new direction in Afghanistan. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would say this:\xc2\xa0 We came in talking about Afghanistan and Pakistan as a region, not as simply two separate and distinct countries, which put emphasis on our relationship and the actions of Pakistan.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but even if there was a new policy put in place in December of 2009, does that erase the mistakes that may have been made years in advance of that --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, of course not --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how can that -- but do these documents then suggest that this war is too far gone --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to turn around with one policy change?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t in any way suggest the documents suggest that and I haven\'t seen anybody to suggest that -- except to say this, Ed, we agree that the direction -- this administration spent a large part of 2007 and 2008 campaigning to be this administration and saying that the way that the war had been prosecuted, the resources that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been devoted to it threatened our national security. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nRemember, we had a fairly grand debate about whether or not the central front in this war was Iraq or Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We weighed in pretty heavily on Afghanistan because for years and years and years, more troops were needed -- more troops actually had been requested by the commanding general, but no troops were forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President increased our number of troops, heading into an important election period, and why we took steps through a, again, painstaking and comprehensive review, to come up with a new strategy.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even after that painstaking review, these documents are suggesting that the Pakistani government has representatives of its spy agency essentially meeting representatives of the Taliban, plotting to attack American soldiers and Afghan officials. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just make sure --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can that suggest the war is going well?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating about seven issues into one question.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, Ed.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- let me finish, let me finish --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Pakistani officials are working with the Taliban, how can the war be going well?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one question.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the war -- the direction of our relationship with Pakistan, based on steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked them to take, has improved that relationship -- right? <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, because last week Secretary Clinton said that the U.S. and Pakistan are \xe2\x80\x9cpartners joined in common cause.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Despite these documents, the U.S. and Pakistan are joined in common cause?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, in fighting, as I just mentioned a few moments ago, in fighting extremists that are within that border. Again, go back to last year, Ed.\xc2\xa0 Remember last year?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When those extremists decided that they were going to march on the capital in Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 That became a threat to Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 For the first time ever, you saw Pakistan fighting back against violent extremists that had otherwise enjoyed safe havens.\xc2\xa0 When General Jones refers to in his statement the actions that they took in Swat and South Waziristan, that\'s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nThe point I\xe2\x80\x99d make on the premise of your question, understand that the documents go through December of 2009.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you meant to conflate actions -- let\xe2\x80\x99s just say that the documents --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, have the actions stopped?\xc2\xa0 Do we know for sure that the Pakistani intelligence is no longer working --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, these documents --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- with the Taliban?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re making progress, and again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer to you --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Making progress but it has not ended even after December 2009?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I would you point you to the hearing that was conducted just a month ago, less than a month ago, with General Petraeus where this was talked about. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed, nobody is here to declare \xe2\x80\x9cmission accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard that phrase uttered or emitted by us as a way of saying that everything is going well.\xc2\xa0 Understand this, that we got involved in this region of the world after September 11th, and then for years and years and years and years, this area was neglected, it was under-resourced, it was underfunded.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what led the President to say that what we needed to do was focus on what was going on in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re here.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The first one is, given the apparent ease that Mr. Manning was able to obtain and transfer these documents, has the White House or anyone of the administration ordered any kind of immediate change to make sure that this is not --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the Department of Defense, that you should be able to discuss what changes they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in operational security.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any insight into what Mr. Manning may have been motivated by?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not personally, no.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the Department of Defense would have something on that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction, can you give us any kind of insight in terms of, was he angry, was he concerned, was he worried?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think any time in which more than 90,000 top secret documents, which are against the law for me to give to you, would -- I think it would be safe to say it\xe2\x80\x99s alarming to find 90,000 of them published on a website.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question, also on Ms. Sherrod.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you had any word on whether she\xe2\x80\x99ll accept the job that\'s been offered and if there\xe2\x80\x99s any time frame for that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a question for her.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on -- I think I know how you feel about this, but the conventional wisdom in Washington is that the White House is trying to keep the focus on the release of the documents rather than what\xe2\x80\x99s in the documents. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say the President is very concerned with this release, this breach of federal law.\xc2\xa0 But is he concerned with evidence in these documents about civilian casualties, about cooperation between the Taliban and the ISI?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 Again, the statements that the President made in March of 2009 very much understand the complicating aspects of our relationship with both of these two countries, the existence of, as I said, historical relationships between the Taliban and Pakistani intelligence.\xc2\xa0 And, look, during the recent debate about General McChrystal, remember a decent part of the Rolling Stone article discusses frustration within our own military about rules of engagement around civilian casualties. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nSo we\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to either conventionally -- through conventional wisdom trying to deflect anything.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m merely saying is that what has been, I think what is known, about our relationship and our efforts in both Afghanistan and Pakistan are not markedly changed by what is in these documents.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think if, again, you go back to March of 2009, what the President says, we are clearly taking steps to make progress in dealing with Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s safe havens; certainly dealing with civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 We all know that in efforts like this to win hearts and minds, you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not going to do that with innocent civilians caught tragically in the crossfire.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In reading these documents, if they\xe2\x80\x99re true, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help but be shocked by what you read in here about some of the horrible things that have happened.\xc2\xa0 Has the President read enough of it himself to be shocked and horrified by it?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- look, Chip, I want to be clear. The President does not need to read a leaked document on the Internet today to be shocked and horrified by unnecessary -- and every civilian casualty is unnecessary -- casualty of innocent life.\xc2\xa0 We can go back -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about them inside this briefing room for well over a year -- times in which our commander at that point, General McChrystal, Ambassador Eikenberry and former General Eikenberry had gone to see different places around Afghanistan that had seen horrific civilian casualties.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, each and every -- as I said, each and every casualty, innocent civilian casualty is a tragedy and it makes the job against the extremists much, much harder.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the -- does the President believe that the release of these documents has harmed or will harm the war effort overall?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think anytime in which you potentially put those that could be -- whose names could be in these documents, missions and operations -- Chip, documents are classified and rated secret for a reason.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the law.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a setback to the war effort?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s concerning that you have -- you certainly have operational security concerns.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think many of our challenges in both Afghanistan and Pakistan are the same today as they were last week.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would tell you that they anticipate that progress isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be slow and difficult in both of these two countries.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m still unclear on where you are on this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty fundamental question.\xc2\xa0 Do these documents constitute a setback to the war effort in Afghanistan?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they constitute a potential national security concern.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House has made a point to say that WikiLeaks is not an objective news outlet, but rather an organization that opposes U.S. policy in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I just wonder if you could explain how that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to the accuracy of the documents.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that the founder of WikiLeaks, if I read his interviews correctly today, comparing troops in Afghanistan to the secret East German police as -- certainly something that we would fundamentally disagree with and something that has -- somebody that clearly has an agenda.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That may be the case, but does that in any way impact the accuracy of these documents?\xc2\xa0 For example, are you suggesting they selectively held back documents that would be more favorable to the U.S.?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Savannah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not afforded -- nobody in this government was afforded the opportunity to see what they do or don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that that question is relevant for me as much as it is for him.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wondered if by making this point you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to I guess attack the credibility of the documents that are out there.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, other news organizations --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have not -- I certainly have not reviewed 90,000 documents.\xc2\xa0 This got brought to us late last week.\xc2\xa0 Again, the coverage I read off of the news documents doesn\xe2\x80\x99t I think materially change the challenges that we have in each of these two countries.\xc2\xa0 As I said a second ago, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the challenges that you would have listed on a piece of paper this time last week are, quite honestly, different based on what we read in this documents at this time this week. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nI think the challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had and the historical relationships with Pakistan intelligence and the Taliban were certainly something we were working to address.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- that in and of itself isn\xe2\x80\x99t a surprise.\xc2\xa0 Working on safe havens in Pakistan and their impact on our efforts in the war -- all of those things -- I think all of those things many of you all have covered.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration confident it has the leaker in custody?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into discussing the aspects of the investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you think -- do you have any comment on the position taken by the U.S. government in the letter written by Richard LeBaron, deputy chief of the U.S. embassy in London, eight days before the Megrahi release, wherein the U.S. supposedly preferred the use of compassionate release over prisoner transfer agreement, and do you have plans to release that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 One, I think the letter has been released by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Two, there was not a preference -- the preference that was enunciated in this letter, the preference that was enunciated in the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to Prime Minister Brown, the preference enunciated by John Brennan and others who contacted the Scots directly was that al-Megrahi should not be released.\xc2\xa0 We think that was the right decision not to -- we think the decision not to release him, we agree with that today; that\xe2\x80\x99s what we publicly stated prior to the release. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The letter says -- and I think this is borne out if you look at the pictures of what happened -- in the event that the Scots make the decision that we do not think they should make, whatever you do, do not let him travel to Libya.\xc2\xa0 Do not let him have a hero\xe2\x80\x99s welcome coming home.\xc2\xa0 We also -- and I think the letter clearly states -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure this was covered in the Sunday Times -- which was we asked for an independent medical examination of Megrahi to ensure that the medical representation about having only three months to live was indeed supported independently. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The preference enunciated by every level of this government was for him to continue to serve the sentence that he was serving until he died.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell me what effort the White House has made before the publication of the WikiLeak documents, and after, to try to contain any political fallout?\xc2\xa0 Any outreach to Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 Any efforts by General Jones or anyone else from the National Security Council --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, we certainly, when we learned of the story, notified relevant committees on Capitol Hill that these documents were about to go online.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I would -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put that under the rubric of containing political damage.\xc2\xa0 I would put that under the rubric of understanding that 90,000 documents dating back to January of 2004, which traditionally don\xe2\x80\x99t become public, were about to be, and Capitol Hill was notified.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what efforts -- I know that you met with the Times. What efforts did you make to try to get in touch with Assange or any of the WikiLeak people?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They are not in touch with us.\xc2\xa0 The only effort that I made in discussing -- the only effort that I made with the Times -- who I will say came to us, I think handled this story in a responsible way -- I passed a message through the writers at the New York Times to the head of WikiLeaks to redact information that could harm personnel or threaten operations or security.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s in their story, in the Times story today.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last question.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned at the beginning of this briefing an investigation into improper leaking of classified information.\xc2\xa0 Is WikiLeaks part of that investigation?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There is an ongoing investigation as to this leak, yes.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the Manning investigation?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.\xc2\xa0 Nice try.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did you try to get The New York Times not to publish?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, never asked them that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s understand a few things.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times didn\xe2\x80\x99t publish the documents; WikiLeaks published the documents.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, had only The New York Times had this story, would we have made a case and an effort, as we have with them and other news organizations, not to compromise security?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 But understand that the Times was one -- The New York Times was one of three news organizations that had access to these documents.\xc2\xa0 We got questions from -- I believe on Friday -- from Der Spiegel, and met with -- Tommy Vietor, Ben Rhodes, and I met with The New York Times on Thursday.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you talk a little bit about any White House concern about support for the war being possibly eroded by the leaks here?\xc2\xa0 Have you done any sort of assessment?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your thinking on that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, Roger, I go back to the point that I made to Savannah and others.\xc2\xa0 I think if you took out a piece of paper, certainly if -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s monthly AfPak reviews will happen on Thursday down in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m unaware of a list of concerns that would be different today than they were a week ago based on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see broad new revelations that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t either concerned about and working through this time a week ago.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll switch the topic.\xc2\xa0 BP.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been informed of corporate changes on their -- what can you say about that or --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would have you talk to BP about personnel changes that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make, if they make them.\xc2\xa0 I will say this:\xc2\xa0 The CEO of BP, the current CEO, Tony Hayward, if he makes the decision or the board makes the decision for him to leave, that\'s one thing.\xc2\xa0 What is clear is BP cannot, should not, and will not, leave the Gulf without meeting its responsibility to plug the well, to clean up the damage that\'s been caused, and to compensate those that have been damaged.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- that is the most important lesson out of here.\xc2\xa0 There are obligations and responsibilities as the responsible party that BP has.\xc2\xa0 And regardless of who leads the company, those obligations and responsibilities must be met.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have some doubt that they won\xe2\x80\x99t carry those out?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not ours to doubt.\xc2\xa0 It is ours to ensure that it happens.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of the spill, Robert, it was disclosed over the weekend that you -- the White House is sending some folks down to Florida -- one to Mississippi and I think one to Alabama --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those numbers are wrong.\xc2\xa0 I can get you better numbers.\xc2\xa0 We sent --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To improve intergovernmental relations and to improve -- I daresay I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten more than a few emails from your news organizations about the inability to get information from the Joint Information Center.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got people that are down at the Joint Information Center; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got people in each state. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nAnd, look, I think if you look at the progress of our response to the disaster -- go back a few weeks, and I forget the exact timeline, but oil gets into a bay that is shared by both Alabama and Florida, right?\xc2\xa0 The western -- or the easternmost county in Alabama, Baldwin County, is notified.\xc2\xa0 The westernmost county in Florida, Volusia is not -- okay?\xc2\xa0 A breakdown in communications from the incident command to the local level. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Out of that we put on-scene coordinators in each of the four affected states and have broadened our ability to ensure that what is happening at a Coast Guard level, what is happening at a direct response level, gets down to local elected officials.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the numbers are wrong?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can get updated numbers on where people went.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to WikiLeaks.\xc2\xa0 Is it your belief that the documents themselves, to the degree you\xe2\x80\x99ve either been briefed about them or they\xe2\x80\x99ve been described to you by people who know a little bit more than you do, are authentic?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve acted as if they were.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 There have been some who\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it and say these things should be viewed by the public as it, to the degree it does, goes through them with some degree of skepticism because they are, by nature, fragmentary.\xc2\xa0 They develop or talk about one certain episode or --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would you as spokesman for the White House advise the public who may be running through these things and taking them in, in some degree of interest --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what is your overall assessment of how much is true?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s not true?\xc2\xa0 Mostly true, mostly untrue?\xc2\xa0 How should they weigh this?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think these are -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99m, Major, not going to play that broad a role except to say that I think obviously this is on-the-ground reporting.\xc2\xa0 What is unclear, certainly, if you read through the stories, is whether some of the events that they think might happen happened.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nBut, again, I think the -- I would sum this up the way I summed it up a little bit ago, and that is that what -- the concerns that are in these documents -- and they\xe2\x80\x99re important concerns; they\xe2\x80\x99re concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly dealt with since the time we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here and certainly as it related to Afghanistan and Pakistan, what precipitated the administration from doing a comprehensive review about our policy in both areas. That is -- our goal is to get this right.\xc2\xa0 Our goal is to keep America safe and to ensure that -- and ensure the safety of those that are conducting these operations.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me take it from a different point of view.\xc2\xa0 There are some -- and this was part of the subtext or one of the subtexts of the Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy series last week -- that maybe too many things are kept secret.\xc2\xa0 Some might look at these documents and say do these all need to be top secret?\xc2\xa0 Is all this information really that vital, really that sensitive to American national security that these should all be top secret?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any evaluation of that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that is -- those are made on a document-by-document basis.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert in the classification process.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously if you -- I think the President would always lean on the American people knowing as much as they possibly can.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think if you --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not this time.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 Go back to the 12 or so meetings held in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 We announced every one.\xc2\xa0 We had readouts from every one.\xc2\xa0 Lord knows, you had readouts beyond the readouts from each and every one.\xc2\xa0 There were photos from each.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly have a cloistered evaluation of our policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve operated. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, and I want to make sure that I\xe2\x80\x99m clear on this -- based on the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no broad new revelations in this, our concern isn\xe2\x80\x99t that people might know that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about safe havens in Pakistan, or that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, as we are, about civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 Lord, all you need is a laptop and a mouse to figure that out, or 50 cents or $1.50, depending on which newspaper you buy.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is, in a sense, top secret.\xc2\xa0 But what generally governs the classification of these documents are names, operations, personnel, people that are cooperating -- all of which if it\xe2\x80\x99s compromised has a compromising effect on our security.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you explain the precipitating factor for the al-Megrahi letter? <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just have a copy of it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I assume -- look, at this point -- and this is some conjecture on my part -- at this point, this is a fairly public process.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what exactly lead to this letter.\xc2\xa0 I know the letter speaks quite clearly to our preference, strong preference, as communicated both in this letter and in conversations that we had directly with the government there, that Megrahi should not be released.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, take your premise that there is nothing really new in these documents that broadly says something different than what we already knew.\xc2\xa0 There are many examples in Washington where the same thing can be said and that a precipitating event like this causes political shockwaves that change the dynamic. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the media culture, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, perhaps.\xc2\xa0 But we know there\xe2\x80\x99s some interaction there.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is -- and it sort of goes back to Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you answered, which is are you all doing anything --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I answered Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s question.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You answered the first part, but not the second part, which was have you done anything since the documents -- since the documents were released this morning to try to assess whether or not these documents provide any ammunition to your critics, any political --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Critics like who?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there are critics of the Afghanistan war, increasingly people who are uncomfortable with it even in the Republican Party.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every call that\xe2\x80\x99s been made out of here.\xc2\xa0 What I was trying to do was decouple the fact that we notified Congress that 90,000 documents are about to be put on a website that were, up until the moment that they go live, were classified documents is part of what is generally assumed to be our notification process.\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of -- I certainly have not heard of a broad effort relating to what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99ll change the subject, too.\xc2\xa0 The President I guess is going to make a statement about the DISCLOSE Act today. And given that that\xe2\x80\x99s coming up in the Senate tomorrow and you\xe2\x80\x99re not expected to get 60 votes -- he campaigned a lot about corporate influence in elections and 527s and the like and for more disclosure -- do you feel like the administration sort of miscalculated or misunderestimated -- (laughter) -- the extent of opposition there would be to trying to crack down on corporate giving?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You mean from Republicans?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And?\xc2\xa0 Just Republicans?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the final vote will be tomorrow, but I know that if you had a sliver of Republicans that thought special interest giving and corporate influence in elections was part of the problem, then this bill would pass.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- alterations to the legislation sought by some groups on the left.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Pardon me?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been alterations to the legislation in the Senate and the House by some groups on the left as well.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a legislative process and then there\xe2\x80\x99s a vote, Major.\xc2\xa0 In a vote, you get to decide what side you\xe2\x80\x99re on.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of voting -- it\xe2\x80\x99s called choosing.\xc2\xa0 You get to decide whether or not you think there is too much --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but in the legislative process objections from the left did arise.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 Now we get to see --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After they got their --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Now we get to see who in the Senate is -- who in the Senate thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s too much corporate influence and too much special interest money that dominate our elections, and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it could be any clearer than that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, especially in the wake of Citizens United, when at the State of the Union speech and such, the President has made a big deal about this, did you -- did he underestimate and miscalculate just how hard this was going to be?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In your words, we might have misunderestimated that those in the Senate on both the Democrat and Republican side shared the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal -- mostly, if not completely, on the Republican side -- in protecting the corporate influence and the special interest donors that seek to not just influence elections but ultimately influence policy. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here in the last few weeks, governing is about choices, right?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re either going to extend unemployment insurance for those that have lost their job, or you\xe2\x80\x99re not for that -- okay?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re either for a small business -- increased money for small business lending, or you\xe2\x80\x99re not for that.\xc2\xa0 And in the next couple days, we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out who thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s too much corporate influence in our elections, and who\xe2\x80\x99s just fine with the corporate influence we\xe2\x80\x99ve got.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 WikiLeaks one more time.\xc2\xa0 To follow on Michael\xe2\x80\x99s question about the inflection points in public opinion in history, what do you make of the comparisons between these leaks and the Pentagon Papers?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the Pentagon Papers are different in the sense that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about policy documents.\xc2\xa0 These are sort of on-the-ground reporting of different events.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see how in any way they\'re really comparable, again, given the fact that -- go back and look at -- again, just in the past month I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the concern about civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not something that has been -- not something that we previously hadn\xe2\x80\x99t touched on that all of a sudden burst out into the public arena.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, as I said earlier, the historic relationships that have been had between the Taliban and the Pakistani intelligence services -- the headline in The New York Times story says -- basically attributes the headline of that connection to U.S. aid. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nSo, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to downplay the seriousness of those concerns.\xc2\xa0 They are serious.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken steps to try to improve that relationship, for the Pakistanis to take certain steps, so that we can build in Pakistan and in Afghanistan a situation that improves our security.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You probably could have said a lot of those things about the Pentagon Papers, too, a lot of those same concerns were raised before.\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is about the public opinion climate --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- does it change it?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the material that\'s in the Pentagon -- again, the Pentagon Papers is a fairly exhaustive policy review by the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 I think as Major said earlier, these are a series of one-off documents about an operation here or an instance there, or a -- they\'re not a broad sort of -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a broad review of aspects of civilian -- progress that we have or haven\xe2\x80\x99t made on civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just on-the-ground reporting on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\'t they kind of paint sort of a portrait, Robert?\xc2\xa0 I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the aggregation of these documents -- don\'t they sort of collectively paint a portrait?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But again, Glenn, you don\'t -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s only a certain time period and you don\'t know what was and what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t either leaked or posted, I think to say that you know everything is probably not the case.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you compare it to Abu Ghraib or at least the repercussions from the impact --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m always -- I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m always loath to look back and compare one event to something else when I just don\'t always -- I think we have a tendency to always want to compare it to something else rather than simply reporting out what -- but, again, Ann, I want to stress again that the notion that -- again, if you wrote down all of what our concerns in our relationship with Pakistan, if you wrote down what they were about our relationship and the challenges that we face in Afghanistan, I do not know that you would list one thing differently today as a result of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve read in these documents that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have already listed a week ago.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t -- and I think that\'s partly your answer to that, Mark, that you don\'t have some revelation that there\xe2\x80\x99s a systematic change of the course of events, that we have stepped up operations at a certain part in the war in Southeast Asia, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve escalated -- that\'s just not -- that\'s not what these documents are.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The head of WikiLeaks tells us that he won\xe2\x80\x99t identify the source of the material.\xc2\xa0 He actually says, we still don\'t know who the source is, but if it was Private First Class Manning, who is already in custody, the head of WikiLeaks says he\xe2\x80\x99s a hero.\xc2\xa0 What does the President say to WikiLeaks and those who believe that they are doing the right thing in outing a policy they disagree with?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are ways in which one can disagree with a policy without breaking the law and putting in potential danger those who are there to keep us safe. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, Ann, if I were to have handed one of you these documents, I would be breaking the law.\xc2\xa0 I think there are certainly better ways to discuss and register one\xe2\x80\x99s opposition rather than putting people in potential harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s Manning\xe2\x80\x99s status, do you know?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you talked about choices.\xc2\xa0 Is the President hoping to sway some choices on the DISCLOSE Act this afternoon or just shine a spotlight for the public on the choices that people make?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that those in the Senate listen to what the President says and take that into account before they vote. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Congressman Rangel, the President is obviously the head of the Democratic Party, and you yourself, when asked about Rangel in February --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to find some stuff on this, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say more?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the Shirley Sherrod case, she invited the President to come to south Georgia, lead him on a tour of some civil rights landmarks.\xc2\xa0 Also, others --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this.\xc2\xa0 Having listened to the call, she invited him broadly to south Georgia.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember them getting that detailed into what a visit or a tour might be.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, is there a moment where the -- is this a moment where the President might lead a national conversation on race?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect us to hear more from the President on this particular --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Peter, I said this certainly a lot last week.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have to look at the events of last week and need the President to lead that conversation.\xc2\xa0 I assume and I hope that, whether it was in the offices of this administration, whether it was in the offices of newspapers, television, radio, or whether it was in the homes of millions of Americans, that we learned a little bit about ourselves and about how we react to things.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President has to be -- as I said last week, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President has to be the teacher in every teachable moment.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Just a different question regarding personnel.\xc2\xa0 Two weeks ago, the Capitol Hill publication \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hill\xe2\x80\x9d reported that a top staffer on Senator Baucus\xe2\x80\x99s finance committee, Ms. Liz Fowler, was about to be named to a key position at the Department of HHS.\xc2\xa0 And Ms. Fowler is also a former vice president of the WellPoint insurance company.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that appointment, and would appointing someone of her position --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I hope you talk to HHS.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t get down to that level of detail.\xc2\xa0 I have not been given that level of detail on any potential impending announcement.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I ask you about the congressional briefings on WikiLeaks?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Richard, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back around.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow on WikiLeaks -- let me just follow on WikiLeaks for a second.\xc2\xa0 Even if there is nothing substantially new in these documents -- you\xe2\x80\x99re in the communications business\xc2\xa0 -- are you concerned that the public and, therefore, perhaps members of Congress will think that there\xe2\x80\x99s something new here, and that perception will drive reality and it will have an impact on your policy?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think inherently the last phrase of your question that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily enumerate was about the politics of all this.\xc2\xa0 The President made a decision to put almost 50,000 more troops in Afghanistan not based on the politics but based on what was right; based on what he believed was -- gave us the best chance at succeeding in Afghanistan, and in making the decisions that gave us the best opportunity to improve our relationship with Pakistan and create, as Ed pointed out, a partnership to go after those in Pakistan that sought to do Pakistanis harm or those in Pakistan and Afghanistan that sought to do Americans harm.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the filter by which the President went through the meetings.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the filter by which the President made that decision. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The politics of all of this stuff will settle out regardless.\xc2\xa0 The question the President asked himself and the question that the team asked themselves in making this decision is, what\xe2\x80\x99s the right policy for this country?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the right policy that keeps us safe, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the right policy that prevents safe havens from being recreated in Afghanistan, where planning can happen again, unfettered, to attack this country, as happened on September 11th?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow on that, please?\xc2\xa0 Is it unanimous among all the administration that this is the right policy, that it is keeping America safer?\xc2\xa0 And what is the U.S. policy towards the Taliban right now?\xc2\xa0 Are there U.S. troops protecting the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s crops?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DOD on that.\xc2\xa0 I would say this, that there was a very, very large, very, very extensive, with multiple inputs, review of where we were and what we needed to do going forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of implementing going -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of implementing that new strategy, evaluating that new strategy and moving forward.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is America really safer?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe America is safer, because if we were not to be in this area, if we were to -- if the Taliban were to come and overthrow a government and create a safe haven that allowed al Qaeda and its extremist allies to not have to plot in a cave but sit in the open and plot the next September 11th, our country would be much, much more dangerous, a much greater target.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has made the decisions that he\xe2\x80\x99s made.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one short question?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, granted documents in the WikiLeak date back to 2004, is this a direct slap in the face to this administration\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence efforts in Afghanistan?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think if it says anything, it speaks to some concerns about operational security.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s directed at us personally.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, and let me -- and also on that, on the intelligence, but more so on a broader scope on intelligence -- after 9/11 the Bush administration kept saying it was not about \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d but a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\xe2\x80\x9d another attack would happen on U.S. soil.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the case, as you deal with intelligence on a daily basis?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into discussing the same type of material I\xe2\x80\x99ve said I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t discuss here, we are -- there are a group of people within this government and within this White House that work each day to make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another -- wait a minute, on another subject really fast, the President is going to \xe2\x80\x9cThe View\xe2\x80\x9d this week to have a conversation with the women of \xe2\x80\x9cThe View.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s also going to be at the Urban League talking about education.\xc2\xa0 Last year at the NAACP, the President talked about education and he put in a lot of civil rights issues as it relates to education.\xc2\xa0 And then he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be talking on \xe2\x80\x9cThe View.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Will the issue -- will he have a cursory possibly conversation with the women of \xe2\x80\x9cThe View,\xe2\x80\x9d who have a tendency to be politically astute on matters in the news on some issues?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Will he have a conversation with them?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On race possibly.\xc2\xa0 Could he generate that --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, you -- I missed that word.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I thought you said, are they going to ask him questions, and I think I can confirm that, as a senior administration official, that that is entirely the case.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the matter of race.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, look, I have no idea what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask and I presume the President will answer their questions. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nLook, I know that we talked about last week that the President has long been scheduled to go the Urban League and will deliver again a speech about what has been done in this administration to change and improve the educational system in this country, and ultimately the opportunity that our children are given as a result of that, and the responsibilities that they and their parents alike have.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will civil rights be infused in that speech?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s safe to bet.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One short question?\xc2\xa0 Just one short --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Les -- Les, it\xe2\x80\x99s not your turn, buddy.\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Why is it your turn back there and I\xe2\x80\x99m up here?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because I said \xe2\x80\x9cSam.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said Sam?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said \xe2\x80\x9cSam.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You were too busy yelling, Lester.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is instructive.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll come back?\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Sam.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you all reached out to Congress last week, and I get that most of this information predates the President --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- honestly, I think that most of the outreach was probably done less last week and more, quite honestly, Sam, over the course of the last 24 hours.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the message that this -- that most of this information predates the President\xe2\x80\x99s new strategy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have gotten through to people like Senator Kerry, who said today that this information raises serious questions.\xc2\xa0 Are you all trying to tamp that down and make sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s a real --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, let me first be clear about -- I think it would be hard to identify anybody that has done as much as Senator Kerry has.\xc2\xa0 He was obviously intimately involved in, met several times with President Karzai around the election and the aftermath on that.\xc2\xa0 He has been -- he\xe2\x80\x99s traveled to both countries and I think has been an important leader in ensuring that our policy is the right one.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then he should know more than anybody that these aren\xe2\x80\x99t new concerns, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still saying it raises serious questions.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not minimizing that this information is out there.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying, Sam, is I think if you asked this of Senator Kerry, I think if you asked this of most on Capitol Hill -- and this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do with whether this stuff predates it.\xc2\xa0 I will say that, again, our concern about the direction of the war, the funding and the resources that were being given to it -- and, look, that is your strategy.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to fund your strategy or if you\xe2\x80\x99re going -- if your strategy is going to be predicated on 25,000 troops rather than 100,000 troops, that limits your ability to impact that strategy. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think Senator Kerry has been a leading voice on this and I think our responsibility and his responsibility as the leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to do all that we can to get this right. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam, we have weekly -- the President hears weekly from commanders on the ground in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and we have monthly meetings -- as I said, that will happen just this Thursday in the Situation Room -- to evaluate where we are and to make adjustments.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is writing -- nobody wrote anything in stone and is then just hoping that it all happens.\xc2\xa0 We will continually evaluate where we are, what needs to happen, how do we build Afghan capacity, how do we train up the Afghan national police and the Afghan national army as part of a comprehensive national security force that gives us the ability, once areas are cleared, to be able to transfer, again, both from a governance and a military perspective.\xc2\xa0 I think all of that is important, and all of that will be continually evaluated.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Just one short -- one short question.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What assurance has the President received from his Secretary of State that in 2012 she will not run for President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a brief question.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am unaware of any assurance that this President needs about his Secretary of State.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to run?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to the wedding?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:06 P.M.
