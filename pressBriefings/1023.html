Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t2:23 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the delay this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have with me the President\xe2\x80\x99s Chairman -- or rather the Chairman of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger, recently confirmed by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He is here to discuss with you the economic importance of the payroll tax cut, extending and expanding it into next year, as well as the importance it has had to our economy and to 160 million Americans this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I would like to do is have him go at the top, for you to address whatever questions you have on the policy issues to him.\xc2\xa0 You may have some political questions, which are more appropriately directed towards me; I will remain here to take them for you -- from you, rather.\xc2\xa0 And then I will let Alan go back to his important and difficult work, and then I will remain to take questions on other subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I give you Alan Krueger.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d say a few words about how the economy is doing and the importance of extending and expanding the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 This is a critical time for the economy, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a time where the economy can use more medicine to strengthen and sustain the recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, a year ago the Congress passed and the President signed a 2-percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 That tax cut has provided important support for the economy, especially at a time when the economy was hit with some shocks such as rising gasoline prices and supply-side shocks from the earthquake in Japan, problems in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has proposed expanding the payroll tax cut to 3.1 percent on the employee side, as well as cutting payroll taxes for employers, focusing the payroll tax cut for employers on small businesses and businesses that are expanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the economic argument for these proposals is quite compelling.\xc2\xa0 I think across the spectrum of economists you would find support for applying this type of medicine to the economy now.\xc2\xa0 The economy has been recovering; we\xe2\x80\x99ve had nine quarters of growth.\xc2\xa0 But the pace of growth has been moderate.\xc2\xa0 We still have a great many underutilized resources.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment rate is still 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 We still have underutilized factories and resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tFundamentally, the economy is facing weak aggregate demand.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s economist-speak for not enough spending in the economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think you can trace the reasons for the weak demand directly to the problems that caused the economic crisis:\xc2\xa0 Families borrowed too much in the run-up to the crisis -- they\xe2\x80\x99re now paying down debt; we had a severe bubble in the housing market; and residential construction has been quite flat in the recovery -- really unprecedented to have a recovery where residential construction has not been increasing.\xc2\xa0 And then on top of that, state and local governments, which retained employees when they were getting support from the Recovery Act, have been laying off workers.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think those are the reasons why the recovery has not been stronger, and at the same time, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to provide insurance for the economy against further shocks, possible shocks down the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the payroll tax is not extended, then the typical family with $50,000 in earnings would face a $1,000 tax increase starting in January.\xc2\xa0 What the President has proposed is extending that tax cut and expanding it so the typical family would have about a $1,500 tax cut, and as I mentioned, other components in the jobs act, the employer side, tax cuts, as well as extending unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take some questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Are you asserting that the extension of the cut would actually make the economy better, or are you just saying that allowing it to expire would make the economy worse?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I think both are true.\xc2\xa0 The President proposed extending and expanding the tax cut, so the beneficial effect that we saw from the last round would be larger.\xc2\xa0 I also think that the tax cuts on the employer side are particularly well designed.\xc2\xa0 The CBO has concluded that the type of incremental payroll tax that the President has proposed has pretty high bang for the buck, compared to other things that could be done to strengthen the economy.\xc2\xa0 And if the tax cut expires, as I said, that will be a $1,000 increase in taxes for the typical family, which would be a drag on economic growth going forward.\xc2\xa0 And you can see economists from across the spectrum who have noted that this could pose a severe drag for growth going forward if it\xe2\x80\x99s allowed to expire.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s extended at the same level, which is something that the Hill has talked about, 2 percent, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t actually do anything to increase demand, increase spending.\xc2\xa0 I mean, people are already getting that cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 Well, compared to letting it expire, it certainly would support the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of unemployment insurance, the extension that we just -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s the other part the President seems to be talking about -- failure to extend that, would that have a similar effect on aggregate demand?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 If you look at CBO\xe2\x80\x99s list -- I think they looked at 11 different policies that are currently being considered -- extending unemployment benefits, they concluded, had the biggest effect on the economy per dollar spent.\xc2\xa0 And the unemployed tend to have a very high propensity to spend their benefits, because they pay bills and little income coming in, running down savings.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think extending unemployment benefits as well would help to support the recovery going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senate Majority Leader Reid has said -- has warned that the failure to extend the tax -- the payroll tax cuts could push the U.S. economy into recession; some independent economists say the same.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree or disagree with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that extending the payroll tax cut will strengthen the recovery.\xc2\xa0 Without it, it will be a drag on economic growth.\xc2\xa0 The forecasts, if you look at private sector forecasts, are for fairly moderate growth, perhaps not strong enough to bring down unemployment without the extension of the payroll tax cut, which is why the President proposed extending it and expanding it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Enough to cause a recession or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 What I can say, from looking at the evidence, is that this is the medicine that we can use in the near term to help strengthen the recovery and to help to provide insurance against shocks that might be coming.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned the problems in Europe, obviously the eurozone debt problems.\xc2\xa0 How much of a drag on the U.S. economy and on GDP growth do you expect for the rest of this year as well as for next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 A number of economists have pointed out that the problems in the eurozone are a potential threat to the U.S. economy and economies worldwide through both financial channels and through our exports -- about 20 percent of our exports go to Europe.\xc2\xa0 I think if one looks at the potential problems for economic growth coming from Europe, it even strengthens the argument for strengthening our own demand here at home.\xc2\xa0 The payroll tax cut is I think an extremely sensible way of doing that.\xc2\xa0 So, looking around at the developments in the world I think helps to strengthen the argument for the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the payroll tax goes to the Social Security trust fund, are you not concerned at all, A, that this will have an effect possibly on the solvency of the Social Security trust fund?\xc2\xa0 And also, B, why do this every year?\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99re calling for -- what the President is calling for, the tax increase will just be delayed until January 2013.\xc2\xa0 Why not just do a whole structural change so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to have this same conversation every year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 Well, on your first question, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this jeopardizes the Social Security trust fund or the solvency of Social Security.\xc2\xa0 The trust fund is made whole by general revenues.\xc2\xa0 The Social Security chief actuary has stated that this does not affect the solvency of Social Security.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, the President proposed a way to pay for the extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut as well as the other components of the American Jobs Act, so over the 10-year period, the budget would be held neutral with respect to these cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the second question, looking at the pace of recovery, looking at the threats that we face today, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s critical that we extend the payroll tax cut and expand it.\xc2\xa0 Down the road, we expect that the economy will be stronger and that the natural process of recovery takes over --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 2013, do you expect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say that recovery has been more sluggish than one might expect coming out of a recession because of the nature of the problems that created the crisis -- because consumers built up so much debt that they\xe2\x80\x99re working their way down, because of problems in the housing market.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the economy heal; it\xe2\x80\x99s just not healing fast enough.\xc2\xa0 So these measures would help to sustain the recovery and, down the road, such measures won\xe2\x80\x99t be necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just do a quick follow-up?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 It seems the language that many in the White House and the administration are using about whether or not the payroll tax cut extension would be paid for is shifting a little bit in terms of how important it is that the pay-for is actually passed in combination with the extension.\xc2\xa0 Would the President sign legislation that extended the payroll tax cut if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t paid for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 The President proposed a way to do this and a way to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Democrats came up with an alternative way to pay for it, which the President has said that he could support.\xc2\xa0 I think both of those approaches are sensible approaches.\xc2\xa0 And I think what we need to do is look for a way to extend the proposal -- extend the tax cut, which makes economic sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, and then Mara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It appears the Joint Tax Committee has said that about a third of small businesses would be taxed additionally if you have the pay-for -- the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmillionaires tax.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be hurtful to the economy, that pay-for, in terms of it hurting small businesses in that way by taxing them additionally to pay for this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 The tax on incomes above a million dollars a year I think would hit very few small businesses.\xc2\xa0 The vast majority -- one figure I saw was 99 percent of individuals with small business income would not be affected by this.\xc2\xa0 So the vast majority of employers would be unaffected by what was proposed to pay for the payroll tax extension.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell has said that you\xe2\x80\x99re proposing to put a permanent tax on millionaires in exchange for this temporary tax cut.\xc2\xa0 What would be the effect of the surtax on millionaires, the economic effect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 Well, the way to analyze economic effect is to say, when does the tax cut take effect?\xc2\xa0 When does the tax increase to pay for it take effect?\xc2\xa0 Those are not at the same time.\xc2\xa0 The tax cut would be immediate.\xc2\xa0 It would be for virtually all working families, focused on families with moderate incomes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo then look at what\xe2\x80\x99s the marginal propensity to spend out of income for the different groups that are affected by the tax cut and the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for.\xc2\xa0 The families that would be affected by the tax cut tend to have a higher marginal propensity to spend, which would provide more support for the economy right away.\xc2\xa0 Those in upper-income groups with incomes above a million dollars a year tend to have a lower marginal propensity to consume.\xc2\xa0 So I think if you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about how is this going to affect the economy in the short run and the long run, this is the right fiscal path for strengthening the economy now and ensuring that it\xe2\x80\x99s done in a fiscally responsible way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you just clarify something?\xc2\xa0 You said it would be a $1,000 tax increase if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t passed, but it would be a $1,500 tax cut if it is.\xc2\xa0 How can that be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 The question is what baselines you use.\xc2\xa0 So if you compare the status quo, if the payroll tax cut is not extended, that would mean starting in January an increase in payroll taxes for virtually all workers of 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 For a family earning $1,000 -- earning $50,000, that equates to a $1,000 tax increase.\xc2\xa0 What the President has proposed is extending and expanding the payroll tax cut, so the 3.1 percent compared to if it\xe2\x80\x99s allowed to expire.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do Ed, then Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask -- the President wants to extend unemployment benefits.\xc2\xa0 You did a study a few months ago suggesting the longer people are out of work the less time they end up spending looking for work.\xc2\xa0 So how does that square with trying to give people more benefits and stay unemployed longer?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 And I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve read the study.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the entire --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was written about extensively.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of research on the effect of extended unemployment benefits, unemployment benefits more generally.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a fair amount of consensus in the economics profession that there are tradeoffs involved, that particularly if you look at normal times when we\xe2\x80\x99re close to full employment, that higher benefits or extended benefits do have some effect on search activity.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat effect is greatly reduced now when we have over four job seekers for every vacancy.\xc2\xa0 The effect of any individual perhaps taking more time to find a job that\xe2\x80\x99s suitable for him or her is going to have less effect when there are other job seekers available for those positions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s on the one hand.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, another effect of unemployment benefits is that it provides critical income support for families when they\xe2\x80\x99re going through a very difficult time.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned earlier that the unemployed tend to have a high marginal propensity to spend out of benefits that they receive to pay for their mortgages, and that helps to prevent foreclosures, and pay for food and so on, which supports the economy more generally.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe CBO, when it looked at this and weighed these different factors, came to the conclusion, which I think is a sensible conclusion, that extending unemployment benefits provides the biggest bang for the buck in terms of strengthening consumption in the economy and creating jobs, taking all of those factors into account.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question, which was whether the White House would accept a payroll tax cut or the UI extension without it being paid for.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President had a proposal and the Senate Democrats have a proposal and that they both make sense, but I think what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know is whether it would be okay to do it without either one of those and just -- would that be one acceptable outcome, given the economics involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into what might happen when the Senate still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t voted on the bill that Senator Casey has proposed; they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote on that later this week.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that from my perspective, and I believe from the administration\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, doing this in a way that makes economic sense is the way to proceed.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the President would consider whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a sensible economic strategy going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think it\xe2\x80\x99s first important that the Senate consider the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s before it, which does pay for this with a way that the Senate Democrats have proposed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some would say that it makes economic sense to -- in a recession to have some upfront spending, even if it does increase the deficit long term.\xc2\xa0 Would you agree with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 You know, I would need to look at what the proposals are and wait until that point.\xc2\xa0 But hopefully Jay can have me back.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely have you back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was what -- so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a perfect world, you don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, does it make sense in this economy to actually find a pay-for for this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into specifics about what kind of -- finding a pay-for.\xc2\xa0 Some pay-fors make sense, some don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is, I think at this point the right fiscal path for the country is to try to support the economy in the short run, and to do it in a fiscally responsible way, which is over a period of, say, a 10-year window -- which is common -- to have it be paid for.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has proposed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re open to not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re open to not paying for it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just take it.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten this, Alan\xe2\x80\x99s now gotten it three times.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to speculate about what might happen if Senate Republicans do not hear the call of the vast majority of the American people to vote in favor of extending and expanding the payroll tax cut, and paying for it in a way that is entirely economically responsible and broadly supported by the American people, Americans of all political persuasion.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that vote hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that enough senators vote for it, that it will then move to the House, pass there, and be signed into law by the President.\xc2\xa0 It would certainly be nice if a simple majority of senators were allowed to vote on this, pass it and send it to the President -- send it to the House and the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\xc2\xa0 We certainly know that a vast majority of the American people support it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to speculate about endgames if certain things do or don\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I got a couple more for Alan because I have a hard out for me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 Knew there was a reason you wanted me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the national debt?\xc2\xa0 It topped $15 trillion a couple of weeks ago, and it\xe2\x80\x99s now bearing down on 100 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0 Does that worry you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that we get on a sustainable fiscal path.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important we measure the debt in the right way, looking at net debt held by the public.\xc2\xa0 But hold that aside.\xc2\xa0 The President has proposed -- in September gave a proposal to the super committee or joint committee of Congress to help put us on a fiscally sustainable path.\xc2\xa0 And I think that as we strengthen the economy in the short run, we need to do two things at once:\xc2\xa0 We need to strengthen the economy in the short run, and we need to return to a fiscally sustainable path.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Congress just extends it at the 2 percent, would that lower the unemployment rate next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at independent estimates from across the spectrum, they would predict that extending the payroll tax cut or expanding it would lead to stronger economic growth and more employment than would otherwise be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just the extension, just the 2 percent, that would lower the unemployment rate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I think that that would create more jobs compared to the situation if it\xe2\x80\x99s not extended.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would that do to the actual rate?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 If you compare it to what the unemployment rate would be if it were not extended, I think because we would have more job growth by extending it, all else equal, it would lead to a lower unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 But the important thing is to compare it to how does it affect economic growth, how does it affect job growth, compared to extending it versus not extending it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me do one more.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on that then, would the White House consider, regardless of the pay-for, simply extending the payroll tax cut without an expansion?\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to rewind what Jay said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRUEGER:\xc2\xa0 The Senate is considering a bill later this week, which has a way to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 The President proposed a way to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re open to economically sensible ways of trying to strengthen the economy and do it in a fiscally responsible way.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Alan.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all.\xc2\xa0 I will now let Alan get back to his economic work, and will take your questions on other issues.\xc2\xa0 I, regrettably, have to leave here in about 15 minutes.\xc2\xa0 Before I take questions, I just wanted to note, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure all of you saw, that the Vice President landed in Baghdad earlier today on a visit, I think his eighth as Vice President, and an even higher number since he was a senator or in the last eight or 10 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tI just want to note that President Obama, when he was running for this office, made clear that if elected he would end the war in Iraq responsibly.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing happen in these final six weeks of the year is the fulfillment of that promise, where we\xe2\x80\x99re withdrawing the remaining U.S. forces from Iraq and we are ending that war responsibly and giving the Iraqi people the chance for a better future that they deserve and also maintaining an important strategic relationship with Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would note that having, as you know, worked for the Vice President during his first two years here, that it was a measure of the President\xe2\x80\x99s seriousness about Iraq and seriousness about fulfilling his commitment that he asked the Vice President to take on day-to-day management of this policy, which is why he has traveled, as you know, so often to Iraq over the last nearly three years.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from a lot of Democrats in the last few weeks who are concerned about President Obama possibly granting an exemption to Catholic churches, hospitals and universities from the requirement that all insurance plans cover contraception.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could shed any light on this decision.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has not yet made a decision, but I think these Democrats, a lot of them in the abortion rights community, are concerned that this is even being discussed.\xc2\xa0 Could you explain why the President is considering an exemption, and what\xe2\x80\x99s going into his decision-making?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, part of the process, Jake, as you know, was seeking and receiving public input before the guidelines that were announced by the Secretary of Health and Human Services would go into effect.\xc2\xa0 That process did result in public input, as well as resulted in numerous comments from various folks who have concerns about this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has -- this decision has not yet been made.\xc2\xa0 You can be sure that we want to strike the right balance between expanding coverage of preventive services and respecting religious beliefs.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the balance that will be sought as this decision is made.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Believe it or not, I had a quick follow-up on the payroll tax.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment about a Senate vote that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about that.\xc2\xa0 I understand your point on that.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is about the President\xe2\x80\x99s point when he unveiled the payroll tax at the end-of-September speech.\xc2\xa0 He said then that every idea in his plan will be paid for, and he has said it dozens of times since then.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if he stands by that, that he has proposals, including this payroll tax extension, he wants Congress to pass them and he wants them to be paid for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will repeat what Alan said and add a little bit to it.\xc2\xa0 As you noted, in September the President put forward a comprehensive proposal, the American Jobs Act, that included within it the extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans -- a tax cut that goes right to hardworking middle-class Americans, a tax cut that has given this year an average of $1,000 extra in the average family\xe2\x80\x99s wallet, and would, if expanded next year, result in a $1,500 tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s very important for those families, to help them make ends meet as we continue to emerge from the worst recession in our lifetime, since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the economy, because as Alan noted earlier, the payroll tax cut is widely viewed by economists -- independent economists and forecasters to have a very positive impact on economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that the best way to do this is the way that he put forward, with the pay-for that he put forward.\xc2\xa0 He also believes that the pay-for the Senate Democrats have put forward meets the principles that he laid out.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to the Senate voting on the proposal that Senator Casey has put forward later this week.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the responsible thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I think I noted the other day, if only Senate Republicans who say they will vote against this express as much passion about the need to cut taxes for the middle class as they express to protect tax cuts and protect the incomes of millionaires and billionaires, we might be able to get this done without much hullabaloo.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this after all -- is anyone here surprised that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a debate with Republicans about whether or not to cut taxes is the right thing to do for the middle class?\xc2\xa0 I thought they were for tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has put forward this tax cut and expanding it for the middle class, for 160 million working Americans, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a vote on that later this week.\xc2\xa0 And what you all are telling me is that Republicans are going to vote against it.\xc2\xa0 They have to explain that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote against it they say so far is because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to be paid for in a way that the vast majority of Americans support that asks millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit extra -- millionaires and billionaires who, as you know, based on the CBO study and many others, have done exceptionally well, have seen their slice of the American pie grow as the middle class has been squeezed.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly hope that Senate Republicans will hear the call of their constituents, reconsider their vote later this week, and pass this with more than 60 votes and send it to the House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing you just said responds to Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question, which was does he still stand by his statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is the President\xe2\x80\x99s preferred choice.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me -- if only it were the case that what this President wanted he got in whole and in full.\xc2\xa0 And certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s what we would ask of the Senate, that they would pass the American Jobs Act in its entirety as written by the President, proposed by the President.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, thus far, this has not happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have had one modest but important success working with the Congress on one element of the Jobs Act, and that was the assistance to veterans, to hiring veterans.\xc2\xa0 We hope that Congress will act on the payroll tax cut and expansion.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what Congress might do, and as Alan said, what pay-fors they might come up with if they vote this down, this very responsible provision or proposal that will come forward in the Senate later this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether the President would sign a bill that is paid for or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the end game is yet.\xc2\xa0 And there is no value in this process or ultimately for the American people who want and deserve this tax cut to negotiate an end game here before we\xe2\x80\x99ve even had a vote.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go any further on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You do it all the time.\xc2\xa0 You put out veto threats.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a bill -- the bill that Ben is talking about and others have now asked in a variety of occasions, a hypothetical bill that puts forward either an extension or an expansion of the payroll --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without a pay-for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- does not yet exist.\xc2\xa0 We put out SAPs when there are bills to put out SAPs on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the idea of rolling back the sequester --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is a bill on -- in the Senate that will be voted on later this week and we fully support that bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to make sure before we lose you, we get you reacting to Iran.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Security Council condemned the fact that the government there did not help secure the British diplomatic offices.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could react to that.\xc2\xa0 But also, has the President instructed any U.S. personnel to do anything with U.S. embassies around the world in other hot spots?\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern about U.S. embassies around the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcement to make with regard to the second part of your question.\xc2\xa0 You might want to check with the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything related to the events in Tehran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI put out a statement earlier today, as you know, saying that the United States condemns in the strongest terms the storming of the British embassy in Tehran.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIran, as every other country does, has a responsibility to protect the diplomatic missions present in its country, and the personnel stationed in them.\xc2\xa0 I would also note that Iran has a responsibility to protect diplomatic personnel -- not just to protect them, but not to try to assassinate them, which was another issue that we dealt with not too long ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior outside of international norms is well established, and this is another item in the catalogue of particulars -- particular transgressions that the Iranian regime has perpetrated over the months and years.\xc2\xa0 And we strongly condemn it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 You note the storming of the diplomatic offices, the embassy, but also the attempted assassination of the Saudi ambassador.\xc2\xa0 Does that not suggest that sanctions, while they\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt the Iranian economy, they have done nothing to stop Iran from operating outside international norms?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we know, Ed, is that we have built an unprecedented international coalition behind the effort to isolate and pressure Iran; to get it to change its behavior; to prevent it from pursuing nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 We have made, through that effort, the choice ever more starkly clear to the Iranian regime that faces them, which is further isolation, further pressure, further scorn in the eyes of the international community, or a decision to get right with the world, to live up to its international obligations and fulfill its responsibilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have recently, as you know, put forward even tighter sanctions on the Iranians -- so have other of our partners internationally -- and we will continue in that effort in a variety of means, not just through sanctions, to isolate and pressure Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President is now in a TV ad, speaking to camera, saying the 2012 campaign has begun.\xc2\xa0 And I know yesterday you guys were pushing back very hard on this concept of it just being a coincidence how many swing states the President has been.\xc2\xa0 But tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99re going to Scranton, Pennsylvania, a swing state.\xc2\xa0 How is this not just a straight-up political trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you are an expert, there is no question, Chuck, on how this works.\xc2\xa0 But we did win Pennsylvania by double digits.\xc2\xa0 I suppose that it might be a swing state next year.\xc2\xa0 You know more about this than I do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point I made yesterday, which I think bears repeating, is that Virginia is 10 minutes away from the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Every President, including this one, makes a lot of visits to Virginia to get out of Washington.\xc2\xa0 This President has.\xc2\xa0 Because he also happened to have won Virginia in 2008, it is now viewed as a battleground state.</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery President ought to be able to travel everywhere in the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of his responsibility, serving the American people, to get out and be among them and to speak with them about his agenda or her agenda.\xc2\xa0 This President will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also true that we are moving forward in what will be a Presidential election year.\xc2\xa0 And this President is running for reelection and fully intends to carry out his role as a candidate and to win reelection.\xc2\xa0 And so that process is also underway.\xc2\xa0 But it is a separate process.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, because the President faces no primary challenger, and the President has enormous responsibilities as President to fulfill -- principally to do everything he can, both legislatively and using his executive authority to grow the economy and create jobs -- he is overwhelmingly focused on that task and not on campaigning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much time is he focused on the campaign on a given day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On a given day?\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it on a given day.\xc2\xa0 I would say on a given week about 5 percent of his time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Question about Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get to Stephen, who\xe2\x80\x99s patiently --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the administration think about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s statement that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for an end to ultimatums to Syria?\xc2\xa0 And it certainly seems like Russia is acting directly against the U.S. and Arab League bid to further isolate Damascus.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, as I noted yesterday, the chronology here, with regards to Syria, I think tells a very significant story about growing international consensus that the Assad regime has behaved reprehensively -- reprehensibly, rather.\xc2\xa0 It has perpetrated gross violations of human rights against its own citizens.\xc2\xa0 It has used excessive violence and force against its own citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is broad international consensus around that idea, and that is why you see so much pressure being brought to bear, not just by the United States, not just by Western nations, but also by nations in the region.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important point.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have an important relationship with Russia that encompasses a lot of issues.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with Russia on every issue, but we certainly have agreed on many and have made significant progress as a result of the agreement that we do have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that in recent weeks Russia has become -- perhaps since the transfer of power was kind of muted, seems to have become a little bit more hawkish on the international stage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply stand back and take note of the fact, with regard to Iran -- subject we were just discussing -- that in the bilateral meetings the President had with President Medvedev, there was no debate about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 There was no disagreement, rather, about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 And you noticed that in the wake of that, when there was a vote at the IAEA Board of Governors, that there was a great sweeping consensus in support of that vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that, again, we have an important relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We have a number of issues that we agree on, and obviously we don\xe2\x80\x99t agree on everything.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon-Christopher.\xc2\xa0 The last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the decision from Pakistan to skip the Afghan conference in Bonn, Germany, on December 5th trigger any concerns from this White House that Pakistan is withdrawing from all international efforts to stabilize the region in Afghanistan before and after the troop withdrawal on 2014?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 We certainly urge Pakistan to participate in this conference.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very important for the future of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Pakistan, obviously, will play an important role in the future of Afghanistan, and we urge them to participate in the conference.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:01 P.M.
