EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for coming to your daily briefing today, on this Monday.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements at the top, so I\'ll go straight to your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben Feller of the Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on the Secret Service. There\'s a report out that a member of the White House Communications Agency is now being investigated.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm whether that\'s accurate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to questions about military personnel to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 As you know, WHCA -- as we know it here -- is staffed entirely by military personnel, not by White House staff and it is a Defense logistics agency.\xc2\xa0 And for everyone involved in the Defense Department\'s investigation of members of the military as related to this incident, I would refer you to the Defense Department, just as for matters involving the Secret Service investigation into Secret Service personnel we refer you to the Secret Service.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s, as you know, a broader White House military office and WHCA is underneath that.\xc2\xa0 As you say, they\'re composed of military members, but it is widely seen as part of the White House apparatus.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Ben, let\'s just be clear.\xc2\xa0 These are military personnel staffed by the military.\xc2\xa0 They are not members of the White House staff.\xc2\xa0 They are not chosen by the White House senior staff.\xc2\xa0 They are no more members of the White House staff than Secret Service personnel, who you see every day on the grounds here, are members of the White House staff. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As is appropriate, personnel actions, investigations and otherwise, that affect members of the military are handled by the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to the Defense Department for questions regarding that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you still comfortable in your statement that to your knowledge, no one other than members of the Secret Service or the military then are being looked at?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you a couple of things -- that -- well, first of all, to make clear, the Secret Service is investigating specific allegations of misconduct by members of the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 The Defense Department is investigating specific allegations of misconduct by members of the military.\xc2\xa0 There have been no specific, credible allegations of misconduct by anyone on the White House advance team or the White House staff.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, out of due diligence, the White House Counsel\'s office has conducted a review of the White House advance team, and in concluding that review, came to the conclusion that there\'s no indication that any member of the White House advance team engaged in any improper conduct or behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, simply out of due diligence, over the last several days that review was conducted, and it produced no indication of any misconduct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Glad I asked.\xc2\xa0 On the comment over the weekend from Senator Lieberman, talking about one member of the Secret Service who stayed at that hotel where the President eventually stayed -- this obviously happened before the President got there -- but the quote was, "Now you\'re into the hotel where the President of the United States was going to stay, and it just gets more troubling."\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that line of thinking, or is that overstated?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the incident itself is troubling. The allegations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen are troubling.\xc2\xa0 The investigation in both cases -- both the Secret Service investigation and the Defense Department investigation -- they are both ongoing, so as was the case last week, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make any broad statements about our assessment of it, it\xe2\x80\x99s broader meaning, steps -- further steps that might need to be taken once the investigations are concluded.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too early for that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The investigation -- speaking now specifically about the Secret Service -- obviously began right away, is ongoing but has produced results, if you will, in terms of personnel who have been separated or separated themselves from the agency.\xc2\xa0 But those broader questions about what it all means, if you will, for the agency and its mission I think are better left until the specific incident itself is thoroughly investigated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A Sonoco refinery, which is the largest on the East Coast, has announced that its summer closure will be delayed for -- by a month if not longer -- not all together -- and the view is that this will help ease gasoline prices.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration think the gas prices may have peaked and, if so, what extent could that be a boost for the economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would hesitate to make any predictions about global markets, including global oil markets, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t engage on the question about which direction gas prices might go. Regarding the specific question that you began with, we are continuing to monitor closely the refinery situation on the East Coast, including the potential impact that disruptions could have on consumers in the region.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on the specific refinery that you mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other question -- a Chinese manufacturer, Hubei Sanjiang, has been implicated in supplying parts for a large missile transporter vehicle that Pyongyang showcased in its military parade last week.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the U.S. about this? And how is the administrating conveying its concern to China that it may not be doing enough to enforce sanctions against military-related sales to Pyongyang.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about it.\xc2\xa0 One, the United States will continue to work with the international community, including China, to enforce sanctions against North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program and nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised the allegations with the Chinese government that you mentioned as part of the ongoing -- our ongoing close consultations on North Korea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the request been made to China --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can only say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised the situation, the allegations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, there have been reports that the opposition is running out of ammunition while, of course, the Syrian government, enjoying relationships with Iran and Russia, does not that that problem.\xc2\xa0 Is it time, finally, for the international community, or for the United States more specifically, to seriously consider arming the rebels there?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think -- does the President think that the Annan plan still needs time to try to work itself out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we voted in favor of the U.N. supervision mission in Syria, the vote establishing that and expanding it.\xc2\xa0 And we believe it can help decrease the violence and lay the foundation for Syria\xe2\x80\x99s political transition.\xc2\xa0 But we are sober about the risks and very clear-eyed about Assad\xe2\x80\x99s behavior with regard to the Annan mission, and its failure to fully commit to a ceasefire or honor the other provisions of the plan, the Annan plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We still do not believe that contributing to the militarization of Syria is the right course of action at this time.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our partners and allies, as part of the "Friends of Syria" but also with the United Nations, to further isolate and pressure Assad, and to make clear to everyone that siding with Assad is making a bad choice, a choice that will not wear well as time passes -- because Assad has brutally murdered his own people.\xc2\xa0 His regime will come to an end.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of not if but when. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe that the measures we\xe2\x80\x99re taking -- working with the international community, assisting the opposition establish itself, providing humanitarian and other nonlethal aid to the Syria people -- is the right course of action to take.\xc2\xa0 But there is no question that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s brutality has not ceased even as it has abated at times during the course of the implementation of the Annan plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In response to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech this morning and the discussion of the Atrocities Prevention Board, Senator John McCain suggested that there was a very -- a great significant similarity between Bosnia, during the Clinton era, and Syria today, and that in his view, thankfully, President Clinton came around to arming the victims and the opposition in the former Balkans, and that hopefully the President would -- President Obama would step up and do the same.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama consider there to be any similarity?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not seen Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s comments making that comparison to Bosnia, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with the President.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President is extremely concerned about the appalling brutality that Assad has perpetrated on its own people.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear, as have I and others when we talk about the actions that we can take in response to different situations in different countries, that there is not a cookie-cutter approach; that the actions we were able to take when Qaddafi\'s forces were on the verge of overrunning Benghazi and, in his own words, killing the residents of Benghazi, the Libyan people there -- that we were able to, because of a broad consensus and a very specific mission that was open to us, take direct action that prevented the overrunning of Benghazi and eventually prevented Qaddafi from taking over the country again. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President said today at the Holocaust Museum in his speech, that we cannot -- we have to do everything we can to prevent these kinds of atrocities.\xc2\xa0 It does not mean that in response to every action, using our military is the right answer. We cannot do that and we should not do that in response to every action.\xc2\xa0 There are other tools that we have, and we have to use them.\xc2\xa0 And right now, that is the case with regards to Syria and that\'s the approach we\'re taking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the White House Counsel\'s investigation, how long did that go on for?\xc2\xa0 When did it begin interviews?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It began on Friday and concluded over the weekend. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\'s important to note, the incident we\'re talking about here involved specific allegations of misconduct by the Secret Service, by members of the Secret Service and members of the military.\xc2\xa0 The decision to conduct a review here, internally, was simply done out of due diligence.\xc2\xa0 There are no, to my knowledge, and have been no credible or specific allegations of misconduct by any member of the White House advance team or White House staff.\xc2\xa0 But out of due diligence this review was conducted, and there is no indication of any misconduct by members of the White House advance team or staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how many interviews did that entail?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have, and I\'m not going to give you, a blow-by-blow of what was involved in the review.\xc2\xa0 I can simply tell you that, again, not because of any specific allegation of misconduct, not because of any credible allegation at all, out of due diligence, the White House Counsel\'s office led this review, and it produced no indication of any inappropriate behavior or misconduct. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was this in response to Senator Grassley\'s letter inquiring about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it was a decision to simply act with due diligence and out of an abundance of caution to do this review.\xc2\xa0 Again, not because there was any -- there are specific things that happened that we know that happened that led to the revelation of this incident.\xc2\xa0 There are specific individuals involved in the investigation by the Secret Service of the Secret Service, and the investigation of military personnel by the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 It was in the context of a presidential trip, and out of due diligence, this review was conducted.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think I made the point that there was no indication of any misconduct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\'s concluded?\xc2\xa0 The review is now concluded?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\'s concluded.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 `And then let me just ask you about another story.\xc2\xa0 The GAO is coming out with a new study today, a new report, that Medicare is wasting more than $8 billion on this experimental program that rewards providers, it says, of mediocre health care. It\'s not producing the kind of results -- it\'s a waste of money and should end.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?\xc2\xa0 Any comment on it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that before the Affordable Care Act, private insurance companies received Medicare payments that were too high and had nothing to do with the quality of care.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the new health care law, we are on track to cut $200 billion in unwarranted payments. This was a much focused-upon element of the Affordable Care Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Medicare continually monitors its programs to ensure they are achieving their goals, and the temporary demonstration program that you\'re referring to is important to identifying ways to improve the quality of care in Medicare Advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since we\'re on the subject, I would call your attention to a report from CMS today indicating that the health care law will save the Medicare program over $200 billion through 2016.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, people with Medicare will save nearly $208 billion, thanks to the new law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 `My understanding is that under the Affordable Care Act that Congress cut Medicare payments to these managed care plans, known as Medicare Advantage, as you pointed out, and authorized these bonus payments to provide high-quality care.\xc2\xa0 The investigators with the GAO found that in fact the bonuses went to average performing plans --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand what the report says, but let\'s put it in context here.\xc2\xa0 One, we think that the demonstration project that you\'re referring to -- program -- is important to identifying ways to improve the quality of Medicare Advantage.\xc2\xa0 One of the things we found in the policy process that led to the Affordable Care Act is that Medicare Advantage -- that there could be significant savings from Medicare Advantage because of overpayments.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, we\'re phasing out over $200 billion in overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans, on schedule. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before health care reform, everyone with Medicare, even those who weren\xe2\x80\x99t in a Medicare Advantage plan, paid higher premiums to support those Medicare Advantage programs -- those overpayments, rather.\xc2\xa0 So the context here is one of squeezing savings out of Medicare Advantage programs, reducing overpayments through these programs.\xc2\xa0 And this demonstration project is simply a way to, we believe, ensure that these programs are as cost-efficient as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did White House Counsel launch the review on their own authority?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it instructed by Chief of Staff or the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well -- the President, no.\xc2\xa0 But this was led by the White House Counsel\'s office.\xc2\xa0 The decision to do it was certainly -- she has the authority to do this, but it was in consultation with the Chief of Staff\'s office, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And those questioned were White House staffers that were part of the advance team?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All White House advance team.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All White House advance team.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President met with Director Sullivan --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And again, without getting into the specifics of what the review entailed, it was a review of the White House advance team and those people on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you weren\xe2\x80\x99t in --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I was not in Colombia in advance of the President\'s arrival.\xc2\xa0 I got there when he did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President met on Friday with Director Sullivan, did the director offer his resignation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a couple questions about the executive order this morning.\xc2\xa0 The first is, why is it limited to just Iran and Syria?\xc2\xa0 Why not -- there are other countries that needs technology to suppress -- in a variety of human rights abusive ways.\xc2\xa0 So why is it limited to those two countries?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would take that in two ways.\xc2\xa0 First, I can get back to you with more specifics about the narrow focus.\xc2\xa0 One obvious reason is we have a circumstance where the use of technology to suppress human rights is very clear and evident by these two regimes, and the EO degrades the ability of the Syrian and Iranian governments to acquire and utilize technology to oppress their own people.\xc2\xa0 It sends a clear message that the U.S. recognizes and is committed to combating this new and growing human rights threat.\xc2\xa0 It holds accountable those government officials, companies and individuals committing or facilitating human rights abuses, and, as part of that process, further isolates both Damascus and Tehran. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly right that, unfortunately, in this world these are not the only regimes that oppress their people or use technology to do it, but these are specific cases that we are focused on right now that this EO can have a direct impact on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re focused on these because it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear and evident in these cases, but not as clear and evident in others?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can work with you and get more information for you on the decision behind focusing the EO on these two bad actors, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any disagreement really anywhere, outside perhaps those regimes themselves, that these are two bad actors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other question is, does this have any impact on companies that supply the technology directly to these governments?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of examples of cases where you\xe2\x80\x99ve had companies, perhaps knowingly, sell technology used to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on the implementation of the EO and what its impacts and ramifications are.\xc2\xa0 I know there are designations involved with the EO, similar to other sanctions and things that were done, but in terms of the companies involved, I have to get back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed and then Kristen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to go back to Norah\xe2\x80\x99s question about Medicare.\xc2\xa0 What Republicans have said about this bonus program is that it\xe2\x80\x99s rewarding folks because it\xe2\x80\x99s trying to kind of mask other cuts to Medicare from the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care reform plan.\xc2\xa0 And you say to that -- because you answered it with a question about overpayments and whatnot.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not really what Republicans are alleging -- that these bonuses are covering up the fact there are cuts elsewhere in Medicare.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of making up for other cuts the President put in, in his health care plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been highly transparent about the savings that are produced because of the Affordable Care Act, the -- as described by the CBO -- the significant deficit reduction brought about by the Affordable Care Act after 10 years, and the truly substantial deficit reduction created in the second decade after implementation of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The savings that are part of that are very important, but this is not -- Medicare Advantage, as you know, prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, had a big problem with overpayments that the Affordable Care Act addressed and will bring about a reduction of $200 billion in overpayments.\xc2\xa0 As part of the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s overall treatment of Medicare Advantage plans, this demonstration project, we believe, is important to increasing the efficiency of the Medicare Advantage plan.\xc2\xa0 So we just have a disagreement about this, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More broadly on Medicare -- I know Secretary Geithner is going to be talking in a few minutes about the trustees report.\xc2\xa0 But more broadly, the early reports have suggested that Medicare is going broke faster than expected, maybe as early as 2018.\xc2\xa0 I know he\'s going to address the details.\xc2\xa0 But how does the President go to voters this year and say that he\'s protecting senior citizens if Medicare is going broke faster than people expected?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to get ahead of the trustees report, but I think -- the President\'s approach has been, from the beginning, when it comes to deficit reduction and the need to reform entitlements in a way that both ensures the guarantee remains for our seniors through Medicare and Social Security but stabilizes our deficit and debt -- that is the approach he\'s taken with every negotiation he\'s had with members of Congress, leaders in Congress on deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is the President\'s approach remains what it was last summer and what it is -- what it was in the fall when he put forward his plan, which is that we need a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 One way we can ensure that we make -- we maintain our commitment to seniors through Medicare and through Social Security is not to cut them so substantially in order to give more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t need to do that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we take a balanced approach to deficit reduction, we can, as the President has proposed and as he has -- the position he took in his negotiations with members of Congress, leaders of Congress, if we cut discretionary -- non-defense discretionary spending, which he has done and signed into law to bring that spending to its lowest level since the Eisenhower administration -- if we cut our tax expenditures, if we reform our tax code in a way that increases revenue and then we reform our entitlements in a way that preserves the guarantee, we can make huge strides towards getting our deficits and debt under control, without doing it on the backs of senior citizens and the most vulnerable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last year\'s report said Medicare is going broke in, like, 2024.\xc2\xa0 Now it says it\'s going broke in 2018.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\'t it sound like everything you just said is not really working because it\'s going broke --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, part of why it hasn\'t worked yet is because Republicans in Congress refuse to accept the basic premise that we need to take a balanced approach to our deficit and debt reduction.\xc2\xa0 They are out there telling the American people, through the Ryan/Republican budget, that we need to dramatically cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans -- dramatically -- and we will pay for that in large part by gutting discretionary spending programs -- investments in education and innovation and basic research and infrastructure -- and by ending welfare -- I mean Medicare as we know it -- ending Medicare as we know it by basically turning it into a two-tiered system that\'s half-privatized through vouchers, that results in the healthiest seniors gravitating towards one system, and the sickest, oldest seniors in the other, which basically ends the program and the guarantee as we know it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And none of that is necessary if you do not accept the premise -- if you do accept the premise that we need to take a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly hope, and the President hopes that, under pressure from their own constituents, Republicans will reconsider the refusal to adopt a balanced approach -- the same approach that every bipartisan commission that has look at this has endorsed, the same approach that not just Democrats but independents and Republicans across the country endorse.\xc2\xa0 The only outliers here are elected members of Congress of the Republican persuasion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing, on Colombia -- did the White House Counsel check the hotel records down in Colombia to see if any White House advance or White House staff --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the review that the White House Counsel oversaw and led produced no indication of any misconduct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then how did they --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- just by asking people, or did they check records?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics of it.\xc2\xa0 And what I also won\xe2\x80\x99t do is engage in speculation about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no specific --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service has been checking records down there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Ed, do you have a specific allegation you\xe2\x80\x99d like to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, did they check --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- because there has been no specific allegation of misconduct.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into all the details of the review, except to say that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- say yes, they did, and there was nothing there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because I am not going to describe every aspect of this review.\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that the review has been conducted.\xc2\xa0 There is no indication of any misconduct by any member of the White House advance team. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Brianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on this review --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I did say you.\xc2\xa0 Brianna, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Outside of the White House, who will you provide details of this review to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just make clear, we have an incident where there were specific allegations of misconduct by members of the Secret Service, specific allegations of misconduct by members of the military, and there are investigations into both those matters by the Defense Department and the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 There is no allegation of misconduct by anyone on the White House advance team or staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s been concern by --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, there\xe2\x80\x99s been rumors published on the Internet by people with no editors and no conscience.\xc2\xa0 But there is no specific allegation of any kind of misconduct here.\xc2\xa0 And only out of due diligence have we conducted this review, which revealed what we thought to be the case, which there was no misconduct by members of the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are concerns on the Hill from Republicans; also Senator Lieberman felt that the scope should be -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if they\'re being looped in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the review has been conducted and there is no indication of any misconduct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be clear.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s purely for internal White House consumption, the results of the review?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, what I can say, if someone comes to us with some credible allegation that anybody at the White House was involved in any inappropriate conduct, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it.\xc2\xa0 But there isn\xe2\x80\x99t that.\xc2\xa0 There is some attempt by some to throw rumors out there.\xc2\xa0 But again, there\'s no -- we had specific behavior that led to this investigation, specific actions that led to the investigation by the Secret Service and by the Defense Department of their personnel.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve conducted a review simply out of due diligence of our people -- White House advance team -- and it produced nothing.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s where we are right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President continue to receive regular updates from Director Sullivan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know about Director Sullivan.\xc2\xa0 We are in contact regularly with the Secret Service about the investigation, and I\'m sure that he\'ll be briefed accordingly.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any meetings or conversations between the President and the Director to preview for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, Egypt canceled its natural gas deal with Israel.\xc2\xa0 In 2005, Egypt and Israel described the deal as enhancing peace and stability in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House view this development?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve seen reports of that nature and we\'re seeking more information.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important to note these are private companies, and I\'d refer you to the companies involved for more details.\xc2\xa0 They\'re companies, they\'re not governments.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important to note that both Egypt and Israel have both said they remain committed to their peace treaty.\xc2\xa0 And as we\'ve made clear in abundance, we strongly support the peace treaty and the Egypt-Israel relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you see it, though, as an indication of -- I mean, are you prepared to --3041<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point -- when we talk about peace treaties between nations, and in this case a peace treaty between two nations, we look to the governments for what they say about them.\xc2\xa0 And both Israel and Egypt have said that they remain committed to that peace treaty.\xc2\xa0 And the two companies involved\xc2\xa0 -- the action that was taken with regard to this matter involves two companies, and I would refer you to those companies for more details.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, it\'s seen as a breach of an agreement.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not seen -- it\'s widely seen as something to be concerned about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, but this is an agreement between two companies, not an agreement between two governments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kristen, then Roger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 If the White House review started Friday, why are we just learning about it today?\xc2\xa0 Why not announce it Friday instead when it started?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen, it\xe2\x80\x99s an internal due diligence review. It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- there are a lot of things that -- well, let me just say specific allegations of misconduct by the Secret Service, specific allegations of misconduct by members of the Department of Defense, specific investigations accordingly. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a matter of due diligence, we have taken a look at our personnel who were involved in the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Colombia, White House advance personnel who were there in advance of the President, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication of any misconduct by them.\xc2\xa0 So I think a couple of days to conduct this review and reach that conclusion is pretty -- both enough time and hardly a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Director Sullivan, can you give us a sense of the tone of that meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details about specific meetings or conversations the President has in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 I think you can -- you would not be surprised if I told you it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious matter and so it was a serious discussion.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I can\xe2\x80\x99t really describe it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why it took the director a week to brief the President?\xc2\xa0 Was that because the investigation was going on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I told you daily, when you asked me, that the President was being kept updated on the Secret Service investigation and this matter, that the director himself was personally in contact with senior members of White House staff, and senior members of White House staff were in contact with other senior members of the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 So there was plenty of communication happening. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has a lot on his plate.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that warrants investigation and it is being investigated appropriately.\xc2\xa0 But it is not something that is his highest priority.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with trying to keep our economic recovery going, trying to help the economy continue to create jobs -- as it has done now for 25 straight months -- and working to ensure that our national security interests are protected.\xc2\xa0 So he has been appropriately briefed.\xc2\xa0 He met to be briefed directly by the Secret Service director on Friday, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be briefed appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, Jay, Senator Susan Collins said this weekend that Secret Service supervisor Paula Reed -- who we all read about this weekend -- "acted decisively and appropriately in Cartagena, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder if there had been more women as part of that detail, if this ever would have happened." Is there a point there?\xc2\xa0 Should there be more women as part of the Secret Service?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say, as I did earlier, that assessments of the institution, culture, broader questions about the mission, I think need to be held in reserve while this investigation into a specific incident is completed.\xc2\xa0 And in many ways, I think that those questions will be looked at broadly, but also specifically by the Secret Service, as is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment specifically to that beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Victoria.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand you can\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily speak to that, but if the percentage of women in the Secret Service is indeed 11 percent -- you can speak to that, correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar even with that figure.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that questions about the mission, the institution, broader questions about the Secret Service that arise from this incident and this investigation, I think, at least from here, I will resist answering because it\xe2\x80\x99s not appropriate while this investigation is ongoing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that those questions in many ways will be and should be to the Secret Service itself.\xc2\xa0 But they are focused on this investigation into this incident at this time.\xc2\xa0 And it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be appropriate for me to make broad observations about the institution during this period.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that if that figure is correct it\xe2\x80\x99s really -- it\xe2\x80\x99s very low?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying \xe2\x80\x9cif that figure is correct what do I think about it?"\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that figure to be correct or incorrect. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- 11 percent as a percentage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a law enforcement agency.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that compares to other law enforcement agencies.\xc2\xa0 I would simply ask that -- you can ask the questions, but I would ask for understanding for why I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make broad assessments of the institution itself, its mission, its culture while this specific investigation is going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Scott then April -- I mean, Roger.\xc2\xa0 Did I call on you and then I didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 Okay, Roger, Scott, April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 There was a story over the weekend in The New York Times about Wal-Mart store officials in Mexico allegedly bragging local officials to get stores opened faster.\xc2\xa0 Is this -- do you have any comment, number one?\xc2\xa0 And is this something that the U.S. government would have an interest? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I read the story, but beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that we would be involved in.\xc2\xa0 So I would refer you to Wal-Mart for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Director Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s briefing of the President on Friday -- was the general counsel in that meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The general counsel of the Secret Service?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House General counsel?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, the White House counsel?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so, but I can find out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question.\xc2\xa0 Apparently one of the agents that\xe2\x80\x99s been implicated is said to have taken a woman back to his room at the hotel where the President was staying -- five days before he arrived, but that hotel.\xc2\xa0 Does that raise your concerns over the President\xe2\x80\x99s safety?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got a version of the question earlier.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on the specifics of the allegations against any of the individuals involved.\xc2\xa0 I will say, as the President said, I believe -- or I said I know -- pointing to the Secret Service, that they have said that neither the President nor his party\xe2\x80\x99s security was ever compromised because of this incident.\xc2\xa0 We depend on, the President depends on -- any President depends on -- the Secret Service for protection and security.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that what the President said and I have said, that we have great respect for and admiration for those agents who, on a daily basis, put their lives on the line to protect the President of the United States and his family.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s very hard work and the President appreciates what they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is an incident that absolutely merits investigation and action needs to be taken when allegations of misconduct prove to be true.\xc2\xa0 But it is also true that the work that they do is extremely important, not just to the individual but to the institution of the presidency, to our democracy.\xc2\xa0 And it is hard work and it is dangerous work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a couple of issues -- getting back to the President\'s speech this morning, he\'s outlining the Atrocities Prevention Board.\xc2\xa0 With that, has there been any movement on U.S. action, potential or actual hostile action as it relates to the Sudan?\xc2\xa0 I asked you last week, and I\'m following up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President -- I would point you to the President\'s remarks about the Sudan and South Sudan, the creation of a new nation -- an effort that we were very much a part of -- the ongoing diplomatic efforts to try to bring about stability between those two nations and in the region.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more specific for you on that as it relates to the Sudan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you find out if he talked to Chinese officials about their efforts to try to help bring peace in between northern and southern Sudan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to -- again, April, I apologize, I\'ll have to take that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 In a request for transparency, could you at least tell us, yes or no, straight up or down, if advance -- White House advance officials who were on the ground in Cartagena -- were they interviewed by the White House counsel?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s useful to get into the details of how that review was conducted.\xc2\xa0 I think that that\'s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask how, I just asked if they were --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- through what modalities the review was conducted, if you will.\xc2\xa0 What you suggested stands to reason, but I don\'t want to get into something where -- well, they did that, did they do this, did they do that?\xc2\xa0 There was a review conducted.\xc2\xa0 There was no allegation that led to the review.\xc2\xa0 There was a review conducted and the result is there is no indication of any misconduct by White House -- members of the White House advance team.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just said what I just asked stands to reason.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying yes they were interviewed?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I\'m saying is I don\'t want to get into -- there\'s no point in getting into the details of this internal review except to say that it was conducted; that the results of that are that there is no indication of misconduct by members of that team.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Steve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 North Korea has threatened to take specific military action against Seoul and President Lee.\xc2\xa0 Is this just the normal propaganda and a demand for attention, or is there any reason to fear that this might be a sort of precursor to any military action similar to the shelling of the island a few years ago?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, North Korea -- the regime there is certainly known for its provocative acts.\xc2\xa0 It is known for engaging in provocations in a series, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out provocative behavior by the North Korean regime.\xc2\xa0 The specific claim made I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to except that behavior by the North Korean regime has resulted in international condemnation, has resulted in our inability to move ahead with the nutritional assistance program that we had discussed moving forward with because we cannot provide that assistance with any assurance that it would get to the right people because of the lack of credibility and the behavior of the North Korean regime. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is absolutely the case is that provocative behavior by the North Korean regime does nothing to feed its people; in fact, it does the opposite.\xc2\xa0 It does nothing to grow that economy; in fact, it does the opposite.\xc2\xa0 It does nothing to reduce the isolation of that regime from the rest of the world; in fact, it does the opposite. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a door open to Pyongyang, a door open to that regime if it chooses to walk through it, which is to renounce its nuclear weapons program, to abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions and to reenter the community of nations.\xc2\xa0 We would very much welcome if they took that step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Olivier.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple.\xc2\xa0 One on the Syria executive order -- how committed is the President to going after Western companies that provide the regime of Damascus with the kind of surveillance technology that he discussed today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I got a version of this question earlier and I will have to get more specifics for you on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Afghanistan by way of France, the front-running candidate there wants French forces out by the end of this year. Is that something that the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy on Afghanistan can overcome?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the French election, as you might imagine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with all our partners in Afghanistan and ISAF, in NATO.\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan will obviously be a focal point of the discussions at the NATO summit in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we are closing in on finalizing a strategic partnership agreement with the Afghan government, which is an important step towards the future for our involvement, for our drawing down of our forces and standing up of Afghan security forces as they take security lead in 2014, and in ensuring that we have a long-term partnership with the Afghan government. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regards to specific countries and their commitments, I think we should wait for Chicago, for the NATO summit, and certainly for the election results.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Now that the President chose the Holocaust Museum to bring more attention to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria, how long is he willing to wait for the Kofi Annan plan to do something before deciding that direct intervention is needed to stop history from repeating itself in history?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I think I would point to one of my previous answers, which is that we are very clear-eyed about the failure of Assad to abide by the points of the Kofi Annan plan in full; very clear-eyed about the continued violence being perpetrated by the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We support the monitoring mission of the United Nations, but we understand the sobering challenge it represents in the atmosphere that has been created by the Assad regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for you to discuss contingencies.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is it is our position that we need to work with our partners and allies to continue to pressure and isolate the Assad regime, to make clear to everyone internationally that siding with the Assad regime is a folly because Assad will go down as a brutal dictator who brutally murdered his own people -- not the kind of friend you really want in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with the United Nations and with the "Friends of Syria," and all other partners in providing assistance to the Syrian people, to helping the opposition function and organize itself and function more efficiently, and isolating and pressuring the Assad regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Greensboro, North Carolina today, the trial of John Edwards got underway.\xc2\xa0 It\'s being led by the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Why is this a priority for the administration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Justice, Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if I just can follow, this started under the Bush administration, so there had to be a conversation with the Attorney General whether or not to continue the trial or not.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President was involved in that discussion --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is a matter for the Justice Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leslie, did you have something?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, and it\'s sort of along the lines that Laura was asking about on the Syria and Iran sanctions, and whether or not it could be extended at some point, or if there\'s talk of other countries, like China, that uses technology to keep tabs on dissidents.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the executive order specifically targets two countries for their behavior and their use of technology to engage in human rights abuse.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- the executive order targets those two countries.\xc2\xa0 It does not include other countries within it, but we obviously have a very clear stand on human rights abuses writ large by all countries.\xc2\xa0 And this specific executive order has to do with two countries and their behavior and their use of technology to suppress their own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Amy, last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\'s trip this week to the colleges -- the Romney campaign has sort of seized on this data, basically saying that a lot of young people are unemployed.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys\xc2\xa0 -- how are you guys responding to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I saw that report, and the logical conclusion of that critique is that they believe Americans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get educated because it\'s not worth it.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s not a single economist with a degree worth more than the paper it\'s printed on who would agree with that assessment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is absolutely a fact that those who have college degrees are half as likely to be unemployed as those without.\xc2\xa0 Now, there is no question that we continue to be in a period of recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression -- a recession -- a terrible, terrible recession that led to the loss of 8 million jobs; a terrible, terrible recession that was precipitated in part by the policies of the previous administration, policies that some of the critics that you mention want to return to in whole.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea. And I think their assessment of the value of education in the current economy is a little suspect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to make mention of that, though?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to steal his thunder.\xc2\xa0 So I urge you to listen to his speech.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:13 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
