EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of updates before we get started.\xc2\xa0 As usual, this morning the President received his Presidential daily briefing from John Brennan.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top homeland security -- top counterterrorism advisor.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan updated the President on a couple of issues.\xc2\xa0 The first is he updated him on overnight developments in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan also updated the President on the preparations that have been underway for several days over at DHS and FEMA, in preparation for the -- for Hurricane Irene. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, FEMA has been in close consultation with state and local officials all up and down the Eastern seaboard to ensure that communities are prepared -- that could be affected by the storm are prepared.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition, the President also was briefed this morning by Brian Deese.\xc2\xa0 Brian is the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council.\xc2\xa0 Brian updated the President on overnight developments in the international markets.\xc2\xa0 Brian also talked through the President the CBO report that was released today with -- that included some deficit projections.\xc2\xa0 And Brian also updated the President on the ongoing policy process that\xe2\x80\x99s underway back at the White House in preparation for the major economic address that the President will deliver shortly after Labor Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of you over the course of the week have asked for a photo of Brian briefing the President, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just been put up on the White House Flickr site.\xc2\xa0 So if folks are interested in that, you can take a look.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition, the President conducted a conference call today with General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt and American Express CEO, Ken Chenault.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Immelt and Mr. Chenault are the chair and co-chair of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council on Jobs and Competiveness.\xc2\xa0 They discussed a number of the proposals that the Jobs Council has been developing.\xc2\xa0 And the President solicited their input on the policy -- again, on the policy process that\xe2\x80\x99s underway related to the major economic address that the President will deliver after Labor Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of things that the Jobs Council -- that Mr. Immelt and Mr. Chenault flagged for the President were a couple of initiatives that they\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing.\xc2\xa0 One is, they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for ways to increase the number of engineers that graduate from American institutions of higher learning.\xc2\xa0 The second thing is they also spoke with the President about some different initiatives that involve putting more construction workers back to work by putting them to work retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient.\xc2\xa0 So they talked about a couple of these ideas. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are actually a couple of Jobs Council meetings that are coming up on August 31st in Portland, Oregon, with Paul Otellini, the CEO of Intel, where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk about the engineering issue.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu and the deans of some colleges and universities will also be there.\xc2\xa0 And then on September 1st in Dallas, Texas, there will be a conversation about investments in infrastructure and the impact that that could have on job creation.\xc2\xa0 So they had that conversation today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead and open it up for questions.\xc2\xa0 Darlene, would you like to get us started?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sure, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Josh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest information the U.S. has on Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we are monitoring the changing conditions in Libya and the developments that have occurred there overnight.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of ways we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, one of them is by monitoring the good work that your colleagues in the media are doing, who are reporting live on the ground in Libya, in Tripoli and across that country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also monitoring open-source reporting methods -- so Twitter, Facebook, other social media tools that are providing some insight into what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ve also -- and probably most importantly -- have been in close touch with the leadership of the TNC about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in close consultation with them for some time, and that has continued.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the developments that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing are an indication that the Qaddafi regime\xe2\x80\x99s 42-year grip on power in Libya is slipping.\xc2\xa0 And that is frankly a testament to the resolve and courage of the Libyan people, that in the -- over the course of the last six months, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make significant progress on that front.\xc2\xa0 And that progress has no doubt been aided by the efforts of NATO and our partners in the region who have provided some pretty significant support on that front.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where does the U.S. think he may be hiding?\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s still in Libya?\xc2\xa0 Not in Libya?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned on Monday, there\xe2\x80\x99s still no evidence to indicate that he has left. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alister.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about the additional sort of level of support the United States is prepared to commit for the post-Qaddafi period to (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s reports of 1,000- to 2,000-strong bridging force being put together by sort of the UAE, Jordan and Qatar.\xc2\xa0 Would the United States consider providing (inaudible)?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information to provide you on that front in terms of that kind of support.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there is an effort that the United States is currently working on to try and freeze up -- or to free up some of the Libyan assets that were frozen as a part of the embargo that the United States put in place several months ago.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re working to free up about $1.5 billion in those funds, in those resources, to provide some humanitarian assistance and to provide some support to the TNC that\xe2\x80\x99s in the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s sort in the early stages of trying to put some governmental infrastructure in place there.\xc2\xa0 So that is obviously a meaningful support that would be helpful to them.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of any sort of additional commitment of resources, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one quick thing.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some concern of weapons from the Qaddafi armory, shoot-down capability, shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missiles falling into the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have concerns about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring closely, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that we are obviously closely consulting with the TNC about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the TNC, are there any concerns about their ability to really carry out this transition in a peaceful way and an effective way?\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure, because this is -- the effort that is underway there is not something that will be easily implemented.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that we do have confidence in the TNC.\xc2\xa0 I mean, after all, it was this President who led the effort to -- several months ago, a couple months ago -- to recognize them as the proper ruling entity in that country.\xc2\xa0 And we are encouraged by the way that they have conducted themselves so far.\xc2\xa0 And we continue -- we intend to be a partner and to be supportive of their efforts to, like I said, put in a governmental structure and transition to a freer Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the President\xe2\x80\x99s jobs proposals, how far along is he in the plan -- in terms of reaching ideas and so forth -- how far along is he?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that there are some detailed policy discussions that are -- discussions and evaluations that are being made at the White House in terms of considering the kinds of things that would be incorporated into that plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is fair to say that those are detailed discussions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President is in the loop on those discussions, that he is -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99re making and he\xe2\x80\x99s weighing in and offering some feedback.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that Mr. Deese is in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard this week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add in terms of the details of the kinds of things that might be included.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that they are -- that they are making progress and that they are reviewing those plans at a pretty granular level.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would you say that there is a framework for a proposal that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be unveiling?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Other than to say that the process is ongoing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more to add to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on that point, that the process is still ongoing, you mentioned the President being briefed on the CBO mid-year report, which is saying economic growth, slow growth for the next several years, unemployment above 8 percent at least until 2014 -- why is the President still in kind of the policy formulating phase almost three years in when unemployment is so stagggering?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One is, there are a number of things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already done that have already been beneficial to the economy in terms of certainly the Recovery Act and the jobs that\xe2\x80\x99s created and supported; certainly the efforts that the President took to strengthen the American automobile industry, that the number of jobs that were protected by that effort is significant.\xc2\xa0 There are also a number of proposals that the President has laid out and has been -- that have bipartisan support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been urging Congress to act on.\xc2\xa0 So this is everything from trade deals to patent reform to some proposals related to an infrastructure bill that would invest in the roads, railways and runways of this country that would create jobs but also enhance our economy by strengthening our infrastructure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things that the President has put in place that could help the economy.\xc2\xa0 What the President is talking about doing and will lay out shortly after Labor Day is what additional measures could be put in place to get that done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CBO report also talks about debt, and it seemed like some good news for short term, that maybe the budget deficit would be a little bit larger; it\xe2\x80\x99s still well over a trillion a year.\xc2\xa0 As a candidate back in the summer of \xe2\x80\x9908, the President said, as a candidate, that then-President Bush adding $4 trillion in debt was \xe2\x80\x9cunpatriotic and irresponsible.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This President has added a few trillion dollars in debt already two and a half years in.\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize adding that much debt?\xc2\xa0 Would it be unpatriotic?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about how that debt was put on the backs of the American people.\xc2\xa0 You basically had two wars that were unfunded, you had a prescription drug benefit that was unfunded, and you had a tax break for millionaires and billionaires that was unfunded, or at least that a significant portion of that tax break was unfunded.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the President extended those tax cuts, and you also had the stimulus you mentioned a moment ago that was nearly a trillion dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But, again, that was in reaction to the kinds of -- the impact of some of those economic policies and a country that was on the brink of another Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of policies that we had to put in place to pull us back from the brink.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what the report today actually indicates is -- it does indicate, as you point out, that some progress has been made, that based on the deal that Democrats and Republicans struck earlier this month, that that is having a tangible impact on our deficit in terms of reducing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the report also makes it clear that there is a lot more that we have to do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why one of the things that the President is going to talk about next month, in addition to some of these new ideas about creating jobs, is actually a suggestion and some ideas for how the super committee can go beyond their $1.5 trillion deficit reduction mandate to actually do even more to address the longer-term fiscal challenges that are facing the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, I think the report sort of validates the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made and validates the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that there\xe2\x80\x99s actually even more that we should do to address this challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last thing.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President made a comment about some people thought he went to Asia to explain the U.S. economy, but said, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t come to explain a damn thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What do you think he meant by that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the full context of his remarks.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that one of the reasons that the Vice President went to China and to Mongolia and Japan was to underscore the increasingly interconnected nature of our world and our economy.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons that he spent so much time in China is because the U.S. and China are the world\xe2\x80\x99s two largest economies.\xc2\xa0 So it is important that we continue to build the kind of -- or promote the kind of understanding and promote the kind of good working relationship because there are significant economic consequences for that back here in this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the comments that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the full context of those remarks, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t react to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates to announce at this point.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, though, is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s FEMA administrator, Craig Fugate, is a legitimate expert on these issues.\xc2\xa0 So, as you may know, Mr. Fugate was the emergency management -- the top emergency management official in the state of Florida and was responsible for leading the recovery effort and response effort to a number of hurricanes in that state.\xc2\xa0 He was actually appointed to that job by Governor Jeb Bush.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is somebody that is a legitimate expert on these issues.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of logistical issues are an important part of that effort.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re so closely -- in such close communication and consultation with state and local officials up and down the Eastern seaboard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there are a couple of things that FEMA has already done.\xc2\xa0 They have pre-deployed incident response teams to both Virginia and North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 And they actually have some stores of commodities in Atlanta -- bottled water, food rations and those kinds of things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they are looking at the very detailed logistical effort to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have the proper resources pre-deployed here.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, the President has complete confidence in Craig Fugate\xe2\x80\x99s ability to handle those responsibilities, and the President has been briefed on these issues every day since Monday.\xc2\xa0 He also had an opportunity to talk to Administrator Fugate yesterday on the phone, where they were talking primarily about the earthquake but they also, at the end of that call, had a conversation about the preparations that have been underway at FEMA to prepare for Hurricane Irene.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing that I would say -- well, two other things I would say about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is, we would strongly urge residents of these communities that are in the line of the storm to pay very close attention to state and local officials and the advice and instructions that they\xe2\x80\x99re offering.\xc2\xa0 State and local officials will be the ones who will make decisions about evacuation orders.\xc2\xa0 And so what we would encourage people to do is to not just listen to the instructions and advice and orders that are given by state and local officials, but to actually follow those instructions.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s really important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second thing is, is if there are people who are out there who are wondering what it is they should be doing to get ready for this storm, they should visit ready.gov.\xc2\xa0 This is a very important online resource that FEMA has put together to give people information about the kinds of things that they should be doing to prepare for this storm. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on jobs and one on Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be included in this plan are some reasonable ideas that could have a tangible impact on improving our economy and creating jobs, but there are also going to be the kinds of things that Republicans should be able to support.\xc2\xa0 These are bipartisan ideas that the President is going to offer up. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, even the ideas that I cited earlier, when it came to Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question, in terms of an infrastructure bill, in terms of extending the payroll tax cut for middle-class Americans that the President actually brokered with Republicans last year, the trade deals -- all of these are the kinds of things that have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some additional ideas that should have some bipartisan support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is no reason that the good ideas that the President is going to put forward to strengthen our economy and create jobs -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that that should get bogged down in political politics in Washington, D.C.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that for six months, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get those kinds of programs -- things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And the President has articulated his frustration about that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s pointed out that the American people voted for divided government, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for dysfunctional government.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to put our partisan affiliations aside and actually put in place the kinds of policies that we know are going to be in the best interests of the country and the best interests of so many Americans out there who are looking for jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya, the President has said and you mentioned that humanitarian aid is going; some of that will be Libyan assets unfrozen, supposedly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has made a commitment, a long-term commitment, to helping the TNC, which is nation-building, again, that America is involved in.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell the American people how long this country will be involved in helping Libya get on its feet, and how much it\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost the American taxpayers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say is that even the resources that were -- that are being unfrozen and that would be released to the TNC, this $1.5 billion in assets, is actually a significant -- should provide them a significant start in trying to build up the kind of infrastructure that they need to build and to provide some of this humanitarian relief that\xe2\x80\x99s so badly needed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are going to remain -- I mean, this is -- the truth is this is an easy way for us to stand on the side of the Libyan people, to be supportive of their efforts, to put in place a government that will acknowledge freedom, that will acknowledge democracy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that will -- that we remain committed to. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of predicting the future, that\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into from up here.\xc2\xa0 But there are some things we can do, like releasing these frozen assets, that could be very beneficial to them, that actually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve, at this point, taxpayer assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should the American public be ready for a five- or 10-year commitment, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Iraq and Afghanistan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the things that I would point out to you is -- certainly, one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s been different about this effort is that there are no -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no American military presence, in terms of boots on the ground, in Libya.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s been remarkable about this operation, that the President was able to provide the kinds of leadership and support for the TNC in close coordination with our NATO allies and with our allies in the region, that we were able to make that kind of commitment without putting boots on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we remain committed to, and that does distinguish it from the situation that exists right now in Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many American citizens probably think that once Qaddafi is found, flees, captured, killed, that America is done.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case; this is a long-term commitment to the people of Libya from the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is a strong commitment from the American people to the people of Libya as they work to build the infrastructure that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to have a free and democratic Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Kristen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last estimate I saw placed the rebel control of Tripoli at 80 to 95 percent.\xc2\xa0 Do you know specifically what it is right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been in close consultation with the TNC.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for the diplomats from other countries, but I can certainly tell you what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing, which is we\xe2\x80\x99ve been closely coordinating with the TNC to offer them the support and guidance that we can.\xc2\xa0 There continues to be a NATO mission that\xe2\x80\x99s underway in terms of offering some civilian protection, enforcing an arms embargo and those kinds of things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there also is a -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, releasing these $1.5 billion in frozen assets.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things the United States can do to support the TNC as they\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in what will be some very difficult work to put in place a kind of governmental infrastructure that, frankly, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t existed for the last four decades.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s some hard work ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Maeve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just give us a sense, since the transition did not happen as quickly as the President was hoping for, of exactly what the U.S. commitment is at this time on the ground or overall?\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any U.S. troops on the ground, but is the White House nudging Europeans or NATO to make that kind of commitment?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House believe that there should be some kind of force, boots on the ground, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not U.S. troops?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those are a lot of questions.\xc2\xa0 One thing that jumped out at me first is in terms of the timing here.\xc2\xa0 And I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to remember that Muammar Qaddafi was a tyrant that ruled his country with an iron first for 42 years.\xc2\xa0 And in the space of the last six months we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a group of rebels, with the support of the international community and the United States, overthrow that regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that timeframe is actually pretty remarkable, that you could see a regime that had been in place and in power for 42 years be overthrown in six months.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s significant.\xc2\xa0 And I think the pace of that change is pretty remarkable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the way forward, it will be a difficult -- there are difficult days ahead.\xc2\xa0 There are difficult months ahead.\xc2\xa0 There are difficult years ahead.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- I should say this.\xc2\xa0 As a tyrant in Libya, Muammar Qaddafi used the resources of his country to perpetrate horrible terrorist acts against Americans and people around the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think there is a pretty tangible interest that we have in putting in place -- in supporting the Libyan people as they put in place the kind of government that will support freedom, that will support democracy, that will allow them to be a constructive member of the international community.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an important reason why we were going to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Libyan people as they continue to move through these very significant changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as far as whether the White House believes that there should be some kind of international force on the ground?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said throughout this process, Carol, that just because the dollar number is smaller doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily easier to move through the Congress.\xc2\xa0 It seems in the view of the White House that there is a significant benefit for members of Congress, from Democrats and Republicans, to move off their preliminary negotiating positions to seek out some common ground that probably will mean making some sacrifices and supporting something in the end package that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by reaching a compromise, we can do something significant for our deficit.\xc2\xa0 And by doing something significant, that is what constituents -- Democrats, Republicans, independents, the American people -- are looking for.\xc2\xa0 They want Congress to act decisively and significantly to deal with our long-term fiscal challenges. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if there is an opportunity for us to do something even bigger than $1.5 trillion, I think you can make a pretty good argument that doing something bigger is actually something that many members of Congress would find easier to support and vote for than something smaller. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he essentially agrees with the Vice President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the White House and the President will lay out some specific ideas about how to enact something -- about how the super committee can go beyond their $1.5 billion -- trillion-dollar mandate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one brief clarification on Libya.\xc2\xa0 You said that Qaddafi -- the Qaddafi regime\xe2\x80\x99s grip on power is \xe2\x80\x9cslipping.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s view that he\xe2\x80\x99s still in control?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty evident from the reports that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing and from the situation on the ground that he is -- that he certainly is not ruling in the way that he has.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that his compound has been overrun on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 But there are a number of developments that indicate that his grip on power has slipped. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stephen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on this meeting between Kim Jong-il and Medvedev?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House welcome it?\xc2\xa0 And has there been any contact with the Russians either before or about getting the talks --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to take that question, Stephen.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 track record on the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic proposals, to what extent will this early September speech really be a political statement, a dare for the Republicans to oppose it so, as he kept talking about on his bus tour, he can take the fight to them and campaign against them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President has been dismayed by the frequency with which people on Capitol Hill have tried to take this argument and turn it into politics, to put politics ahead of the legitimate debate that we should be having about the policies that should be in place to strengthen our economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I suspect that there will be some who will look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech and dismiss it as a -- as politics.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what the President is aiming to do and what the President is committed to doing is putting aside politics, rising above partisan rancor, and putting in place the kinds of policies that have bipartisan support that will strengthen the economy and create jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this proposal is going to be about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President -- that, frankly, is what the economic team is working so hard to put together.\xc2\xa0 And so we are hopeful -- and the President made reference to this when he was on his bus tour through the Midwest last week -- he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that there will be members of Congress who, after a few weeks back in their districts, will come back to Washington, D.C., with a greater willingness to put the interests of the country ahead of their own political calculation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do that, I think they will find lots of things in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech that they\xe2\x80\x99ll like. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya, a couple of quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Do you mean to be stepping back from what the President said the other day?\xc2\xa0 He said that Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s control had unraveled, that his power had come to an end, and you seem to be indicating today that he still has some semblance of authority, some influence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to suggest that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the Qaddafi -- Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s grip on power has slipped; there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 And so our assessment is the same as it was when the President delivered his remarks on Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And after 42 years under him, what makes the administration and those who have been in contact with the TNC think that their vision of democracy will be the same as our vision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I suggested that that that would be the case.\xc2\xa0 What I suggested is that we have established a good level of coordination and a good working relationship with the TNC.\xc2\xa0 We are optimistic about what they are saying that they would like their government to look like, that the kinds of values that they\xe2\x80\x99re espousing leave us with a lot of optimism about the future there.\xc2\xa0 But we are committed to working closely with them as they work to put in place the kind of government they would like to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carrie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The week after Labor Day is looking sort of increasingly crowded with the debates, a speech from Romney, a speech from Palin (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 Is there any discussion or chance that the President -- does the President still intend to make a speech that week or is there any discussion about moving it up or back or -- because of how crowded that week already looks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any greater specificity for you about the timing of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, except to say that it will be delivered after Labor Day.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it will be that week -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it would be the day after Labor Day or the week after Labor Day or two weeks after Labor Day.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that the President believes is pretty important, and it will be an opportunity for him to lay out some proposals and some initiatives that should garner bipartisan support, to strengthen our economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the timing of that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have additional details for you at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a consideration, how crowded that week is looking?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt in the minds of the people at the White House who will be putting together the schedule that you and your colleagues in the news media will give that speech the appropriate level of attention. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the jobs piece and this discussion of stimulus measures, are there new stimulus ideas -- tax cuts, credits -- that we can expect as part of this package, or does it go beyond --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There will be some ideas that the President will lay out in this speech that I expect that you and others will consider to be new ideas.\xc2\xa0 So that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the President is in any way sort of backing away from some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already talked about, that already have bipartisan support, that the Congress should be moving on.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of things that are out there that would do some good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 This speech is actually an effort to try to build on those ideas and to offer up some new suggestions about how to strengthen our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Republican senators -- Republican support for some of these measures.\xc2\xa0 Is he talking to Republicans as part of this process, this stage of his decision-making?\xc2\xa0 Does he see a need to do that?\xc2\xa0 Is he doing that, either on the Hill or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- in terms of the last couple of days, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he\xe2\x80\x99s had any of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s spent a good portion of the summer talking with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill about the economy and about our long-term fiscal situation.\xc2\xa0 So it is fair to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s had extensive consultations with them.\xc2\xa0 I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out future conversations.\xc2\xa0 But it is our goal here -- again, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about what our goal is:\xc2\xa0 Our goal here is to put in place policies that will strengthen the economy, that will create jobs, and that should earn bipartisan support in the Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s in our interest to make sure that we have a good sense about what it is that Republicans would like and could support.\xc2\xa0 And that will be reflected in the speech that the President gives after Labor Day. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is the President considering a proposal or signing an executive order that would require that all new or renewed federal contracts -- contracts with the federal government contain a job creation clause?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been one specific proposal that would involve a net increase of 1 percent of payroll.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President thinks makes sense or have you ruled that out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have to tell you, Margaret, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information for you on those.\xc2\xa0 So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we connect afterwards and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some information on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the two -- the Immelt and Chenault proposals that you mentioned earlier, are those being discussed as part of what the President would roll out in his speech or completely separate from that package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are proposals that the Jobs Council is reviewing.\xc2\xa0 The President sort of gave them this charge to go out and explore some ideas with the private sector that would create jobs.\xc2\xa0 So the President will certainly incorporate the work of the Jobs Council into the policy -- the ongoing policy process related to the speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily say whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll be included, because that process is still ongoing.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President expects to draw on the work and expertise of the people who are serving on his Jobs Council into that policymaking process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is right to say to say that at least we know that two of the proposals that he may be considering talking about in the package that he unveils after Labor Day are the two that you mentioned that he discussed with them --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan is the primary point of contact.\xc2\xa0 He has spoken to Mr. Fugate, which he did yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan has been his primary point of contact, and at this stage, the most important thing is for the professionals at FEMA to be in contact with their counterparts at the state and local level, because that is where this preparation effort is being administered, and it\xe2\x80\x99s where the recovery and response effort will be administered. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that effort is underway.\xc2\xa0 As I pointed out, there are a couple of teams that have been pre-deployed to North Carolina and Virginia.\xc2\xa0 There are some commodities stocks that have been pre-deployed to ensure that they are in the area and can be delivered quickly after the storm if they are needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so that consultation, that coordination is going on at a -- between federal emergency management response officials and state and local emergency management response officials.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process; I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific that the President has done on that at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 One of the -- I can tell you that one of the reasons that the President wanted to spend a little down time with his family here in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard was the opportunity to get away from the limelight a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Certainly he can\xe2\x80\x99t do that completely. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously had some important decisions and some important conference calls to participate in over the last few days.\xc2\xa0 But I think seeking to find other people in the limelight to spend time with has not been the principal objective over the last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know the score on any of the golf games?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to give you an up-to-the-minute readout of that.\xc2\xa0 But as you can tell from the readouts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve offered, he\xe2\x80\x99s spent a decent amount of time dealing with sort of the day-to-day responsibilities of being President, but also some of the emerging situations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last couple of days in terms of the developments in Libya, in terms of the earthquake, in terms of the preparations for the hurricane. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there have been some things that have intervened, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten an opportunity to spend some time with his daughters before they have to go back to school.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyed quite a bit. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us if there are U.S. assets, intelligence assets, on the ground in Libya helping to try to find Qaddafi?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 If you wanted to direct that question to the State Department or the Department of Defense --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you at least confirm that there are U.S. intelligence involved in it at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I cannot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the earthquake yesterday, he was not aware of it, correct, on the ground when he was playing golf?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did not feel the earthquake yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was he told that it had happened?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am not sure about that.\xc2\xa0 He was told soon after.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the mechanics of how that occurred and who told him, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction when he heard the strength and the scope of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the one who told him, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of what his reaction was.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kristen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the point of the President potentially changing his vacation plans, I know you said you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new scheduling announcements.\xc2\xa0 Is it something that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed, though, that the President might go home early?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it has.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously watching the weather reports pretty closely for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 And if there\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that that would factor into this as scheduling changes, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously take the appropriate measures.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any conversations that have occurred like that at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about how the White House has been watching the developments unfolding in Libya on television.\xc2\xa0 Has the President himself watched any of the coverage of what has been going on over the last 24 hours or so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I got to be honest with you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen any of the television coverage.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously keenly aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s being reported on television.\xc2\xa0 Because, again, one of the sources of information that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting is from the good work of journalists who are putting themselves in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way to try and report out this information and to get some greater clarity about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he certainly is aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s being reported on television.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen those -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen those television reports firsthand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he mostly been watching FOX?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask two for colleagues back in D.C. since we may not get you back on camera?\xc2\xa0 One colleague is working on a piece about the President\xe2\x80\x99s environmental legacy.\xc2\xa0 What do you think, heading into the reelection -- the economy is a big issue, a lot of big issues -- what does he think his environmental legacy is so far?\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to do (inaudible)?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the hallmark achievements of this administration -- and I think something that will have a tangible impact on the environment, but also on our economy over the long term -- are the CAFE standards, agreements that the President has reached with automakers and with manufacturers of large trucks and buses that some of the advancements that have been put in place in close consultation with the private sector are the kinds of things that over the long term will tangibly impact our environment for the better.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The truth is, it\xe2\x80\x99s also going to have a pretty tangible impact on the strength of those manufacturing industries, too.\xc2\xa0 So this is one of those policy decisions that falls in the category of a win-win.\xc2\xa0 And I think that when people look back at some of the advances that were made on environmental policy over the last two and a half years, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably one of the most significant things that has been achieved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another election issue are all these super PACs on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 Conservatives have them, liberals have them; AFL-CIO has created a new one, trying to keep Democrats in office by protecting Democrats on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about the influence of money in politics, wanting to reduce that.\xc2\xa0 You seem to have super PACs on both sides of the aisle raising millions and millions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 What kind of concern -- does he have any concern about that, given his rhetoric on cleaning up the system?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has said is the President does believe that in the interest of good government that disclosure is what we should be looking for here, that as a principle, that principle of transparency in terms of who\xe2\x80\x99s bankrolling these outside groups is something that the American people deserve to know and journalists like yourself should have the opportunity to review or at least investigate why those donations might have been offered up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that the President -- again, this is sort of -- campaign finance reform is something that has fallen victim to political wrangling on Capitol Hill, that this -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a position where because Democrats and Republicans have been unable to find common ground on this issue, we have a -- the result is a -- is a policy or an environment that isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the best interests of the American people.\xc2\xa0 So the President is interested in working with Republicans to try to resolve these issues.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we get a similar corresponding effort on the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there was a lot of criticism before the vacation started, there has been a lot of criticism during the vacation -- with Libya happening, the earthquake happening.\xc2\xa0 What does the President say when he hears this?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his reaction to folks saying, you should be back in Washington?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My sense is, is that his reaction is that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be focused on doing his job.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, this is a job that he\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for doing wherever he is, whether he\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in the Oval Office or whether he\xe2\x80\x99s caught on the golf course when an emerging action takes place.\xc2\xa0 And he has been satisfied with his ability to do his job even in these unusual locations, that he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to convene these calls of his top national security team to ensure that their response efforts are proceeding apace; that he can be confident that the preparations that FEMA is putting in place in advance of Hurricane Irene are moving along at the rate they should be. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President has on a number of occasions sort of dismissed the notion of cable chatter.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99s really focused on trying to do his job, which is something he recognizes that he always has to do, because he\xe2\x80\x99s the President of the United States wherever he goes, but also, taking advantage of an opportunity at the end of summer -- at the end of the summer to spend some time with his wife and daughters.\xc2\xa0 And I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied that he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to do both of those things over the last several days. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there one final question that we want to take?\xc2\xa0 Way in the back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the President has been consulting with a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 But has he consulted with any former members of Congress or anything like that on how to get this kind of thing through Congress?\xc2\xa0 Has he taken a historical perspective on this?\xc2\xa0 Because everything else hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been working all that well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, off the top of my head, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a former member of Congress that the President has consulted with.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that one of the things that we are committed to doing is making sure that we put in place the kinds of proposals that Republicans should be able to support. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a number of ideas out there that would be good for the economy that would create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s been holding them up so far is partisan rancor on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has said this repeatedly, the American people voted for divided government, not dysfunctional government.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our hope, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s hope, that members of Congress will come back from the August recess and they\xe2\x80\x99ll come back prepared to put aside their own political interests if they can act in the best interests of the American people and the best interests of the American economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that he can jumpstart that process by delivering this major economic address shortly after Labor Day.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll move from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that address in D.C. or somewhere else?\xc2\xa0 Have you talked about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional updates to provide in terms of the venue.\xc2\xa0 But when we have that, I\'ll make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re among the first to know. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, everyone enjoy the rest of your day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 12:41 P.M.
