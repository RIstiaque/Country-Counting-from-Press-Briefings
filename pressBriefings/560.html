EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to the great city of Pittsburgh in the great state of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p class="p3">I\'m sure you all heard the President deliver his State of the Union address last night.\xc2\xa0 This morning he had a terrific event at Costco in Lanham, Maryland, where he highlighted the need for hardworking Americans to receive a living wage, and highlighted the action he\xe2\x80\x99s taking through executive order to lift the minimum wage for new contracts under federal contractors to $10.10 an hour, and calling on Congress to reward hard work and responsibility by raising the minimum wage across the country.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now we\'re headed to do an event where the President will talk about his proposal for a new, simple, safe retirement account -- MyRA.\xc2\xa0 And to discuss that with you today, I have the 76th Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Jack Lew.\xc2\xa0 Here he is.</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 And good to be with you this morning.\xc2\xa0 Let me just go through a few of the details of what MyRA is.\xc2\xa0 MyRA is going to be a very simple, very safe retirement account that will, we believe, bring people who are now not participating in any kind of retirement savings into a place where they are.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got a very low threshold for participation -- takes $25 to open an account; minimum contributions per pay period are $5.\xc2\xa0 It fills a niche which gets people who have not yet participated in to a place where they\xe2\x80\x99re both comfortable doing it because their principal is protected and guaranteed, and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for them to do at the workplace on each pay check having just a little bit come out.</p>\n<p class="p2">When you look at the landscape of the retirement savings market, this is really a space that\'s not well served right now. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for people to participate for the first time.\xc2\xa0 They need something that\'s simple, that\'s provided in a way that they can do that requires -- has very little friction.\xc2\xa0 It needs to be in a small-dollar amount, and I think the safety feature, the fact that the principal is protected, will give people who are not accustomed to saving the comfort that they should do this, can do it.</p>\n<p class="p2">And what we\'ve learned is that when people start saving they get into the habit of saving and they ultimately save more and for longer.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that is, I think, going to lead into a natural transition for people to participate in more traditional 401(k) kinds of savings, IRA kind of savings.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get started; this is a great place to get started.</p>\n<p class="p2">It is modeled on the Roth IRA, so the contributions to it will be after taxes.\xc2\xa0 The income will be tax-free until you retire.\xc2\xa0 It will be something that rolls over at $15,000 into a vehicle of your choice -- it\xe2\x80\x99s capped at $15,000.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not meant to be a replacement for, it\xe2\x80\x99s really a bridge to the other aspects of retirement savings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">It is not the entirety of what we believe we ought to do on retirement policy.\xc2\xa0 We have had proposals over the years.\xc2\xa0 We think there are other things like the proposal the President has had over the years to have the opt-out instead of the opt-in feature.\xc2\xa0 But we think this fills a space which, very importantly, we can do by our own authority.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have the authority at Treasury, the same authority that\'s used to issue savings bonds, where we can make this product available. And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'re going to have in place by the end of the year, and we\'re very excited about it.</p>\n<p class="p3">Why don\'t I stop there and take questions?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The return -- we got a fact sheet that says the return is modeled on the federal plan.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me what that return is like?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same structure as the G Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan, so it\xe2\x80\x99s the average of yields that are above four years.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'re very familiar with because most federal employees have a Thrift Savings Plan and it\xe2\x80\x99s really the same mechanism.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the yield maybe in a recent year?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to go back and check.\xc2\xa0 Obviously rates have been very modest recently, but it is the safest and most guaranteed investment product.\xc2\xa0 It will fluctuate as interest rates go up and down, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a rock-solid, safe contribution.\xc2\xa0 The principal is never at risk and it will be at the rate of Treasury bills.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the main difference the threshold where people will participate?\xc2\xa0 Is the main difference then between this and other vehicles the threshold which people will participate?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge to get people into a retirement product.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one of the reasons that in the past we\'ve proposed taking away frictions for people who opt out instead of opt in.\xc2\xa0 This is something that if you\'re an employer and you offer the option for someone to get in, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a savings bond plan at work.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very easy, very simple, very small contribution levels.\xc2\xa0 And we think that it is important for building the nest egg, $15,000 is obviously not enough for most people to retire on -- but you have to start with something.\xc2\xa0 And if you can graduate from this kind of a program to being in the habit of savings, people over a career will be much more secure at the point when they reach retirement.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I\'m trying to understand.\xc2\xa0 When people say what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between this and other things you can already do, the difference is the low threshold?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 Well, the product itself, the guaranteed federal bond fund is new.\xc2\xa0 That\'s available to federal workers through the G Fund, but that\'s something that\xe2\x80\x99s new.\xc2\xa0 The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s designed to be at a very low contribution level --\xc2\xa0 frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the market that the private sector is not served very aggressively because it\xe2\x80\x99s something that they have not considered to be that attractive a market.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re very interested in products that would be the kind of next-step products.\xc2\xa0 So if this gets people to save and they save $15,000, there\xe2\x80\x99s a world of options out there that they could graduate into.\xc2\xa0 So this actually fills a niche that we think is a very important one to fill.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you mentioned on the $15,000 -- is that per year, or the life of the program?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 That\'s cumulative.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cumulative.\xc2\xa0 Do you have an estimate as to how many people might sign up or enroll in this?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re going to roll it out by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to work with employers of various sizes -- small, medium and large -- to get a good mix of employers in there.\xc2\xa0 And we want this program to be up and running at the end of the year, beginning of next year, and then take off from there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So I\'m not going to give you an exact number, but --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A range?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 No, we know that there are millions of people who are not now saving for retirement.\xc2\xa0 This is a product that we want to get established and then grow it as fast as we can.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This can obviously be created just by the stroke of a pen, you don\'t need any congressional help for it?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.\xc2\xa0 We have the authority to issue this product.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And where will the accounts be housed?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 There will be a fiscal agent that manages the account, much as we do with other programs now.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going out as soon as the program is launched and going to go through a competitive bid.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you have to encourage employers to participate?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 We are reaching out to employers.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re seeing interest in it and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that is going to be compatible with plans that employers already have that will help provide something to employees who are not participating now.\xc2\xa0 And for those employers who don\'t have a plan, it will be a very simple, low-administrative barrier for them to put a plan in place.</p>\n<p class="p2">Obviously for employers who offer matching and other incentives, there are good incentives for a lot of individuals already.\xc2\xa0 But we still have many, many people who are not eligible for plans or who are not participating in plans, and we want to get them started.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance that -- right now, as proposed, it limits it to one choice, government bonds.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance that you would expand the choice?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 I think at the moment, we see this very simple, very safe product as being -- that\'s part of what makes this so attractive, that there is nothing as safe as a federal bond fund where your principal is guaranteed.\xc2\xa0 And we think that that\'s the right way to start this program.\xc2\xa0 Obviously when people graduate and roll into a different kind of investment fund they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a world of choices, and that\'s something that we look forward to people making those kinds of choices.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, one thing you can\'t do with executive order is raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Is the timetable for that still what you have said before, end of February?\xc2\xa0 And how are things going with Republicans in Congress on that issue?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve tried to be very clear throughout that we will share information as we have it.\xc2\xa0 I wrote to Congress last week.\xc2\xa0 What I told them was that we reach the debt limit on February 7th, as they know, that our extraordinary measures will run out at the end of February in all likelihood, and that they needed to act in that window because it was the only responsible thing to do.</p>\n<p class="p2">I think they have accepted the deadline.\xc2\xa0 All the discussions that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had and the things that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read show that they understand that they need to do something by the end of February.\xc2\xa0 And I think they also understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any kind of a negotiation or a ransom paid for Congress to do what it needs to do, which is pay the bills that it\xe2\x80\x99s already committed to.</p>\n<p class="p2">Just to remind everyone, the budget agreement at the end of the year set a frame for two years of spending.\xc2\xa0 Just a few days ago, Congress passed an appropriations bill that actually spends money.\xc2\xa0 All the debt limit does is it gives us the ability to pay the bills that are already incurred.\xc2\xa0 And since 1789, Congress has always done the right thing and they need to do it again.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the confusion as some, even Democratic lawmakers had about the extraordinary measures going well into the spring?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any confusion now.\xc2\xa0 I think that there are various people who do estimates of when extraordinary measures will run out.\xc2\xa0 Ours are the ones that are based on the best data, the most current understanding.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the authoritative ones.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any ambiguity now.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, can you talk a little bit more about the automatic IRA, the piece that you would like Congress to act on? It\xe2\x80\x99s something you\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed before, but just to go over it again.</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we need legislation to do that, so while we\xe2\x80\x99re doing today something we think that\xe2\x80\x99s very important to fill an important space, we know from many studies that if you make saving for retirement easier, if there\xe2\x80\x99s no friction, more people will do it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we think the MyRA is going to trigger a lot of interest.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But we also know that if you are an employer and you set up a plan so that people are in it unless they choose to opt out of it, more of them will stay in it.\xc2\xa0 Since we so firmly believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to start saving early and save for the duration of their careers to have a safe and secure retirement, we continue to believe that that would be a good proposal.</p>\n<p class="p2">Today, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we can by putting MyRA in place.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, they\xe2\x80\x99re not one instead of the other.\xc2\xa0 This is a different niche.\xc2\xa0 For someone who it\xe2\x80\x99s a step to put the $25 in and then $5 a pay period, we need to get them started.\xc2\xa0 And this instrument that we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed, that the President announced yesterday, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking more about this morning is really a special opportunity where by our own authority we can create an incentive to make it easy for people to get in.\xc2\xa0 We would love to do more and we remain open and willing to working\xc2\xa0 with Congress on more.\xc2\xa0 But this is a very important first step.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the proposal with the automatic IRAs is that employers would then have to offer this, right?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 It would make it a default.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If they had a 401(k) program -- that the default is that you --</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And obviously anyone could opt out of it.\xc2\xa0 It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be required that you stay in it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in multiple administrations and you just talked about one of the virtues of this being that you can do it without Congress.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about this larger approach for the next three years, how much you feel like using executive authority is going to be satisfying to various priorities that you and the President have?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that we have from the beginning looked to see what we can do to address the problems that the country and the American people face.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done it through executive action; we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it through legislative action.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President said last night is that we continue to be ready to work with Congress, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to continue to use the tools we have.\xc2\xa0 And today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of MyRA is a perfect example.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we don\xe2\x80\x99t need legislation for.\xc2\xa0 We should be doing it.\xc2\xa0 And we should still try to do more things working with Congress.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there will be examples coming up that will be broader in scope and more --</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 In my current role, I would be happy to offer my opinion, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jay speak more broadly.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one other question about your current role?\xc2\xa0 Argentina just made some changes to its currency rules. There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of fluctuation in emerging markets recently.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys concerned about that?\xc2\xa0 Are you talking to your G7 counterparts about it?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY LEW:\xc2\xa0 I talk to my counterparts all the time, both when we\xe2\x80\x99re in meetings and when we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on kind of day-to-day movements in markets.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a lot of differentiation in the marketplace and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the countries that have taken tough actions and managed well are having a different experience.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Just to pick up where Secretary Lew left off, in answer to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s question, the President is not President of Washington -- he\xe2\x80\x99s the President of America.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of activities happening around the country that is moving this country forward, that\xe2\x80\x99s expanding opportunity, and that creates the possibility of further rewarding hard work and responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And the President is embracing that and pushing forward in any way he can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">As Jack said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of only pursuing actions through his executive authority or the power of the office and not pursuing legislation -- he\xe2\x80\x99s doing both.\xc2\xa0 As he made clear last night, there are a wide array of things that the President believes he and Congress can work together on and he spelled those out last night.\xc2\xa0 He also made clear that there are a number of things, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s raising the minimum wage for federal contractors, or creating simple, safe, new retirement accounts for the American people, that he can do on his own using his authority.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to put every tool he has to work on behalf of the American people.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how many people will the executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors with new contractors affect?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s for new contracts, as you know.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a figure related to that.\xc2\xa0 I find it extraordinary that people are dismissive about the possibility of helping those Americans who will be affected, and obviously there will be a growing number of Americans affected as new contracts take effect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">This is a perfect example of the President using his authority to help as many Americans as he can, and in calling on Congress to do the job of helping even more Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he did last night.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s using the authority he has to lift the minimum wage for federal contractors and he\xe2\x80\x99s calling on Congress, as he did last year, to pass legislation that would raise the minimum wage across the country.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason you can\xe2\x80\x99t give a ballpark figure?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not an economist.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the data --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no one in the White House is, and certainly they have the data.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No one in the White House is an economist?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No one in the White House is giving us a figure.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a figure.\xc2\xa0 I think if the point is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a portion of the population smaller than everybody working for the minimum wage, that\xe2\x80\x99s accurate.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s even, obviously, because it\xe2\x80\x99s new contracts, it\xe2\x80\x99s a building population that grows as new contracts are established.\xc2\xa0 But the point is the President can take this action to raise the minimum wage using the authority he has, as he calls on Congress to fulfill its responsibility to the American people and give America a raise.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a figure or the White House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t bothered to look at it?\xc2\xa0 The President just announced a policy and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how many people --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen a figure, Peter.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Valerie said yesterday a couple hundred thousand.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s the figure or not.\xc2\xa0 What I know is what stands to reason is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about federal contractors and you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about new contracts -- because there are obviously some contracts that are in place now and some of them expire sooner rather than later, et cetera, et cetera -- that the population affected directly by the order to raise the minimum wage will continue to grow as new contracts are drawn up and take effect.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t somebody have done the research knowing how this would affect people before it was announced?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can keep asking me if I have a figure.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a figure.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking whether the White House did any research on this.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to take your question.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that the point that you and the Speaker of the House are making that the number is relatively small is understood.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the American people believe the President should not take action to help those Americans who need help and then call on Congress to help the rest.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s actually not my point.\xc2\xa0 My point was just asking for the factual number.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and like I said, I don\'t have it and we\'ll get it to you -- I\'ll check and see what we can get to you.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen that number.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the House passed the farm bill this morning.\xc2\xa0 The Senate is supposed to do so this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be signing it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are pleased by the progress that we\'ve seen. As you know, the President made clear last fall that this was something that he believed Congress needed to and could act in a bipartisan way to get done.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'re not there yet.\xc2\xa0 Final legislation has not reached his desk.\xc2\xa0 So we await that happening and hope it does.\xc2\xa0 If the bill as it is currently designed reaches his desk he would sign it.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on this broad question again of using executive authority, are there particular sectors where you think -- having done this assessment -- where you think it will be most effective?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously you\'re very focused on a couple of economic initiatives now, but beyond that, can you just give us a sense of where are the areas where you think the President has the most leverage to do it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it depends on what kind of use of the pen and the phone you\'re asking about.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to executive orders like the one to raise the minimum wage for federal contracts, that depends obviously on analysis of where he has the authority to do things.\xc2\xa0 He has a much broader capacity to lift up and rally support around issues like the need to expand educational opportunity, access to education, or the need to connect skills training to employers.</p>\n<p class="p3">You saw that with the summit a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, another use of his authority in the establishment of manufacturing institutes, and he said last night that he intends to create four by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And that obviously has enormous beneficial impact on the continued revival of manufacturing in this country.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I think the opportunities are pretty broad.\xc2\xa0 But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at what a President can do simply through the prism of what legislation can get passed, nor should we look at what a President can do using the power of his office only through the ability to sign executive orders or presidential memoranda, because another aspect of his office and the authority is not specific to those issues.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- I\'m not foreshadowing anything.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, the President did not enumerate everything he wants done and everything he supports in his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 No President ever has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">When it comes to the Employment Non-discrimination Act, he is fiercely supportive of that effort, enormously gratified by the fact the Senate took action and very hopeful that the House will follow suit.\xc2\xa0 Because as I\'ve said many times, reflecting his opinion, members of the House who block this are being left at the station as the train moves forward on what would obviously be an America where equal rights are extended to all Americans.\xc2\xa0 So I think his record on LGBT rights is crystal-clear, his position is crystal-clear, and he continues to press Congress to take action on ENDA.</p>\n<p class="p3">More broadly, there is a great opportunity -- greater in 2014 than we\'ve ever seen -- to pass comprehensive immigration reform in a way that meets the principles the President laid out, that reflects the support of one of the most diverse coalitions you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen behind legislation, including business and labor, law enforcement, faith communities, Republicans and Democrats around the country.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful and optimistic that the House will follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead and this year pass comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p class="p3">The President has made clear that the way to address this issue is through a bill that takes action on security, on making sure everybody is playing by the same set of rules, on reforming our legal immigration system to make sure that all those super-smart people from around the world who come and study in our universities are able to stay here and start businesses in America so that the jobs of the future are here, and that creates a process by which the 11 million undocumented people in America are able to get in line and attain citizenship.</p>\n<p class="p3">So we remain, as the President said, hopeful and optimistic that there is progress on this important matter.\xc2\xa0 I think Congress will act.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just preview very briefly tomorrow in terms of -- we know where we\'re going, but is there something you could say about what the theme is tomorrow?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more on that.\xc2\xa0 If I do by the end of the day, I\'ll come back and give it to you.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why a steel mill for the retirement piece?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why a steel mill for the retirement piece?\xc2\xa0 I think in this case these are workers who have exceptional or strong retirement benefits and I think the point the President will be making is we need to make sure that opportunity is out there for Americans across the country. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more detail.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more data for you.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had another question on the Earned Income Tax Credit. Last night, the President mentioned Senator Rubio and his proposal.\xc2\xa0 Does he want the minimum wage and an Earned Income Tax Credit expansion, or if it came down to choosing between one or the other, which --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he suggested he wanted to choose between one or the other.\xc2\xa0 I think he thinks both are important. I think what he said about Senator Rubio is that the Senator also acknowledged and recognized the fact that the Earned Income Tax Credit does not benefit in the same way it does other single Americans who are not with children -- custodians of children.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity here to expand the benefits of the EITC to more Americans.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t12:02 P.M.
