Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:50 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0Let me do a quick statement at the top, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions. \xc2\xa0This is news that you may have seen, but I just wanted to underscore some important developments at the United Nations today.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe international community has strongly condemned North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s weapons of mass destruction proliferation activity and its continued efforts to advance its nuclear missile programs with unprecedented sanctions. \xc2\xa0U.N. Security Council Resolution 2270 contains the most extensive multilateral sanctions measures to date, including new sectoral sanctions on North Korean mineral exports, and financial sanctions targeting North Korean banking activities in support of its WMD programs.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe resolution also imposes unprecedented inspection requirements on North Korea cargo, and closes loopholes in the implementation of sanctions. \xc2\xa0To be clear, today\xe2\x80\x99s actions are not aimed at increasing the suffering of the North Korean people. \xc2\xa0Rather, our collective goal is to increase the costs on Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s leadership as it stubbornly seeks to advance its prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programs. \xc2\xa0We have consistently said that North Korea would face consequences for its actions, and we welcome this unanimous resolution as a firm, united, and appropriate response by the international community, including China and Russia, to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s recent provocations that flagrantly violated multiple Security Council resolutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe commend the work of the Security Council in sending a strong message to Pyongyang that there are significant consequences for flouting its international obligations. \xc2\xa0And today, the international community, speaking with one voice, has sent Pyongyang a simple message: \xc2\xa0North Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, Kevin, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, Josh, staying on the same topic -- does the U.S. expect North Korea to seek to retaliate for the sanctions approved today? \xc2\xa0And could you talk about any precautions that are being taken in anticipation of such actions? \xc2\xa0And can you talk a bit about who will be conducting the inspections of cargo going in and out of North Korea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0For the way that these sanctions are implemented, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d actually refer you back to the U.N. \xc2\xa0Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s the international community that would impose these sanctions and redouble our efforts to make sure that the cargo inspections are carried out. \xc2\xa0So they may be able to provide some additional detail about how exactly this is implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to our expectations of the North Koreans and what potential reaction they may have, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of clarity about that. \xc2\xa0Obviously, these actions on the part of the international community are a response to provocative actions that North Korea has already taken in the last couple of months. \xc2\xa0And we obviously have already taken a number of steps to ensure that our allies in the region and the American people here at home are protected from North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s potential capabilities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked at some length about how over the last several years the Obama administration and President Obama has directed an increase in assets in the Asia Pacific to include anti-ballistic missile technology and systems that could protect the United States from any sort of North Korea missiles. \xc2\xa0There are a number of steps that we have taken to enhance the capabilities of our allies in Japan and our allies in South Korea to protect themselves, as well. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be mindful of any additional steps that may be needed to ensure greater protection for the United States and our allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this a little bit before, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve been approved today. \xc2\xa0Why are these sanctions -- why will they be any more successful than past efforts to curb North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear missile program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, because these sanctions actually go far beyond the sanctions that have previously been imposed on the North Koreans. \xc2\xa0And there are several different ways to evaluate that. \xc2\xa0For the first time, this resolution would require an inspection of all cargo going into and going out of North Korea. \xc2\xa0For the first time, this would prohibit the sale of small arms or other conventional weapons to the North Korean regime. \xc2\xa0It also would impose broad sectoral sanctions on those aspects of the North Korean economy that are functioning. \xc2\xa0This is significant because we know that these industries -- things like coal, iron, gold, titanium, and rare-earth minerals -- are industries in which revenue is both dedicated to enhance the lifestyle of the North Korean elite, but also in some cases used to advance North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear and missile programs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re taking action that would have a direct impact on their capacity to continue to carry out these provocative actions. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s different than what has happened before. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see if this increased pressure and increased isolation is sufficient to prompt a change in strategy on the part of the North Korean regime. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Turning to last night\xe2\x80\x99s elections, I wanted to ask how you interpret the results on the Republican side. \xc2\xa0Was there a clear winner in your view? \xc2\xa0And on the turnout, it seemed like the Republican turnout in the Super Tuesday states really increased while Democratic turnout in many of the states was down. \xc2\xa0Is the turnout a sign that Donald Trump is making the Republican Party bigger?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple of things about the turnout, last -- or about the turnout, first. \xc2\xa0The fact is, there were not actually too many battleground states that convened primaries or caucuses last night. \xc2\xa0There were only two, sort of depending on how broad of a definition you have for battleground states -- Minnesota and Virginia -- Virginia being the most important one because of its size and given the way that it was so aggressively contested in the last two presidential elections. \xc2\xa0I think certainly President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s political strategist would tell you that his success in Virginia, both in 2008 and 2012, was an important part of his political strategy. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no downplaying the political significance of Virginia.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you take a look at the results, you see that the winner of the Democratic primary drew far more votes than the winner in the Republican primary. \xc2\xa0And these are open primaries. \xc2\xa0So you can go and vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary based on which candidate you intend to support. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is clear that the winner of the Democratic primary is the candidate in Virginia that has the most support in Virginia. \xc2\xa0And I think that is an indication of the level of excitement on the Democratic side.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you take a look at Minnesota, you see a similar dynamic, but in some ways it\xe2\x80\x99s even more pronounced. \xc2\xa0Both Democratic candidates in Minnesota individually got more votes than any Republican candidate in the Minnesota caucuses. \xc2\xa0So I think this is an indication that there is ample enthusiasm on the Democratic side, particularly in the places where it matters most in the general election.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what is also true is that, again, based on the public reporting from all of you, that at least some of the strong turnout in the Republican Party was actually due to hostility to the current Republican frontrunner. \xc2\xa0And that would also be a troubling dynamic for Republicans in a general election if that were to occur in a general election, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore broadly, as it relates to the outcome -- and this is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the last couple of days, anticipating this outcome -- and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the part of the Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. for the last six or eight years has been a reflexive opposition to President Obama, and a consistent refusal to embrace the responsibility to govern. \xc2\xa0And I think the best example of that are the roiling political debates that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in Washington, D.C. over health care reform. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans have proudly talked about the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve voted 50 or 60 times now to repeal Obamacare, but never once has there actually been a Republican alternative to Obamacare that\xe2\x80\x99s been put forward for a vote -- not one. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a similar story to tell about immigration reform. \xc2\xa0We hear all of the candidates on the campaign trail and here in Washington, D.C. rail about the broken immigration system in the United States. \xc2\xa0This administration worked closely with some Republicans to try to cobble together a bipartisan compromise, but that bipartisan compromise was blocked in the House of Representatives from even coming up for a vote. \xc2\xa0And there was never a Republican alternative put forward that had any chance of passing either house, let alone be signed into law by the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe same is true when you consider gun safety legislation. \xc2\xa0There is strong support all across the country among Democrats and Republicans for common-sense steps that would reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that has to be a partisan thing. \xc2\xa0And there are a number of Democrats that have put forward specific proposals for reducing gun violence, but yet it is Republicans that have, time and time again, blocked those Democratic proposals without putting forward anything of their own. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this goes back to what we were talking about earlier -- when you have party leaders in Washington, D.C. that don\xe2\x80\x99t stand for something, their supporters are likely to fall for anything. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I wanted to ask -- moving on to Syria, I know that the White House has said that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take time to see whether this cessation of hostilities is actually going to be successful and to determine kind of the outcome of that. \xc2\xa0But now that a few days have passed, I wanted to see -- does the White House have any sense or assessment of where things stand now on the cessation of hostilities? \xc2\xa0Is it meeting expectations? \xc2\xa0Are there concerns? \xc2\xa0Where are things at now on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I asked for an updated assessment today, so I have some information I can share with you here. \xc2\xa0In recent days, we have seen an overall reduction in airstrikes against Syrian opposition and civilians. \xc2\xa0And that is a reduction when compared to the number of airstrikes that were conducted against Syrian opposition and civilian targets prior to the implementation of the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0That obviously is an encouraging sign.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, we are concerned about reports that the Syrian regime has engaged in tank and artillery attacks against civilians near places like Latakia, Homs, and Hama, and around Damascus. \xc2\xa0And obviously, those kinds of attacks, if confirmed, would be a flagrant violation of the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\'re going to monitor these reports of violations. \xc2\xa0We take them quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to continue to strongly urge all parties to exercise restraint and abide by the commitments that were included in the cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re also encouraging all of our partners in the ISSG to use their influence with parties on the ground to not engage in actions that put the cessation of hostility at risk. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of diplomatic work that goes into this. \xc2\xa0And as we acknowledged prior to the implementation of the cessation of hostilities, we anticipated all along that we would encounter some resistance, that we would hit some potholes. \xc2\xa0But there at least are some tentative indications of a slightly improved situation inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s more that needs to be done, and we\'re going to follow up on every report of a violation. \xc2\xa0And we take violations -- particularly as it relates to tank and artillery attacks against civilians -- quite seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut our goal here, remember, is the cessation of hostilities can hopefully allow for a more sustained flow of humanitarian assistance to those communities that are in dire need, and also try to provide an additional boost to the fledgling effort to reach some sort of broader political agreement inside of Syria that results in a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And so that diplomatic political work continues. \xc2\xa0But that\'s the update that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received about how the implementation of a cessation of hostilities is going.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that humanitarian relief getting through? \xc2\xa0I know some opposition groups have raised concerns about that. \xc2\xa0When they talk about continuing on with the peace talks, part of what they want is that humanitarian aid. \xc2\xa0So is that humanitarian relief getting through at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s starting to. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we believe needs to be done to speed the flow of humanitarian aid and allow for the provision of that assistance to become more routine. \xc2\xa0But we have seen reports that the pace of that aid being provided has stepped up. \xc2\xa0That obviously is a welcome development.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of people inside of Syria who are innocently caught in the crossfire who are in pretty desperate need of basic medical supplies, food, water, and other basic materials that humans need to survive. \xc2\xa0So we would like to see the pace of those humanitarian shipments increased. And hopefully that will happen as the cessation of hostilities continues to be implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the Supreme Court, Harry Reid today said that a nominee is expected within a week or so. \xc2\xa0So I know that you\'ve been reticent to talk about timing and things like that. \xc2\xa0But just giving it a shot, I mean, should we expect a nominee within the next week? \xc2\xa0Or can you rule that out? \xc2\xa0And if that\'s the case, if it\xe2\x80\x99s moving that fast, are there interviews going on right now with candidates?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, Ayesha, I think we are sort of reaching the height of the most frustrating part of this process for those of you who are trying to cover it, which is that I don\'t have an updated assessment for you in terms of timing. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t have initial details to share about our ongoing efforts here to make a decision about who the best person would be to serve on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0We won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to provide much of an indication about whether or not individual interviews have started.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe one piece of process that I can share with you today is I understand that our leg affairs teams has now been in touch with the office of every member of the United States Senate about this particular nomination. \xc2\xa0And obviously, many of those calls were not placed by the President himself, but by senior members of his team. \xc2\xa0And it does underscore -- it\xe2\x80\x99s another way to illustrate the seriousness of purpose on our part when it comes to consulting with Congress in advance of making a Supreme Court nomination. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On that same subject, yesterday after the meeting here at the White House, we heard McConnell very clearly and publicly state this vacancy will not be filled this year. \xc2\xa0Does that change the optimism that you expressed yesterday at all, that they still could take this up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it doesn\'t change. \xc2\xa0I indicated yesterday that out of the -- that during the meeting, no one represented a potential change of opinion here. \xc2\xa0And the view that Leader McConnell articulated after the meeting is the same view that he\xe2\x80\x99s been articulating since just a couple of hours after Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s death was announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you really think after he said that so definitively, that there\xe2\x80\x99s some chance that he would change that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that Leader McConnell has a way of expressing himself rather definitively. \xc2\xa0In fact, he did that back in 2008 when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cEven with lame duck Presidents there is an historical standard of fairness as to confirming judicial nominees.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So he seemed pretty definitive then, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s most important here is the clarity of the Constitution that says the President shall appoint someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and the Senate shall do its duty to offer advice and consent. \xc2\xa0And that means giving that individual a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote. \xc2\xa0That\'s not a controversial notion. \xc2\xa0That is not subject to any sort of legal interpretation. \xc2\xa0That\'s everybody\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of what the Senate is supposed to do. \xc2\xa0And the question really is whether or not Senate Republicans are willing to put that constitutional duty ahead of their own political considerations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday, we heard some interesting words from the Vice President. \xc2\xa0He jokingly thanked Donald Trump and he said, the stuff that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, Cruz and the others, making the American people look in the mirror. \xc2\xa0And he talked about the divisiveness maybe being a good thing for the American people, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\'s a good thing to awaken the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0That\'s quite a bit different from what we\'ve heard the President say on the rhetoric that\'s been out there -- as well as what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said. \xc2\xa0I mean, you guys have said that it\'s bad for America\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world and the divisiveness is just making partisanship worse. \xc2\xa0So, I mean, do you disagree with what he said then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the Vice President is just making an observation about Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 electoral prospects in a general election. \xc2\xa0I think his analysis actually dovetails pretty cleanly with the analysis of a lot of establishment Republicans in Washington, D.C. who are also concerned about the impact that Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy would have on Republicans up and down the ballot.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the divisiveness and the rhetoric that you\xe2\x80\x99ve really slammed in the past -- do you now think that that\'s a good thing? \xc2\xa0Or do you think that it\'s -- I mean, he said that it\'s a good thing for America, to awaken the American people. \xc2\xa0But you guys have said that it\'s a bad thing for America and hurts our standing in the world. \xc2\xa0So kind of, which is it? \xc2\xa0I\'m confused.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think what the Vice President was offering up is his own analysis about Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 prospects in the general election. \xc2\xa0And again, a lot of Republicans that you talk to around this town at least seem to be offering up an assessment that\'s quite similar to what the Vice President has said, which is that most Republicans who are going to be on the ballot, if they share that ballot with Mr. Trump, probably will not see their electoral prospects enhanced by the presence of Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is all academic at this point. \xc2\xa0There are still additional Republican votes that need to be cast. \xc2\xa0Republicans need to do more work to choose their nominee. \xc2\xa0And it\'s difficult to predict in advance exactly how a general election is going to shape up before a Republican nominee has been chosen and before a Democratic nominee has been chosen. \xc2\xa0So all that\'s premature. \xc2\xa0But I think what we continue to be confident about -- and the Vice President will have an important role in this -- is that we\'ll be able to make a strong case about how Democrats and the Democratic candidate for President is one that is strongly supported by the big tent of the Democratic Party and is committed to building on the important progress that our country has made over the last seven years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So do you think you disagree or agree that the divisiveness could be a good thing for the American people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, my view is the that when it comes to Democratic electoral prospects that, as many Republicans have said, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presence at the top of the ticket may not end up being particularly helpful to them. \xc2\xa0What there\xe2\x80\x99s no question about -- and Republican leaders agree with this, too -- is that the divisive rhetoric that we\'ve heard from Mr. Trump is directly contrary to the values that this country has long defended. \xc2\xa0And there will continue to be a debate on the Republican side to choose their nominee, but if this is a debate that we have in the general election, I would feel bullish about the strength of the Democratic argument.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think that that divisiveness and that same rhetoric that you\xe2\x80\x99ve decried in the past is actually helping Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And lastly, the North Korea sanctions. \xc2\xa0Do you have any real expectation that that will change North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s behavior?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think time will tell. \xc2\xa0They were just passed by the Security Council just a couple of hours ago. \xc2\xa0So we, the international community, is quite serious about implementing these sanctions. \xc2\xa0These sanctions and these restrictions will be more robust and rigorous than sanctions that had previously been imposed on the North Korea regime. \xc2\xa0We would anticipate that they will have an impact on the ability of the North Korean elite to enjoy the exalted lifestyle that they currently enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also anticipate that it will have an impact on industries that we know are used to fund their nuclear and ballistic missile programs. \xc2\xa0This required a significant commitment on the part of the Chinese and the Russians, and we certainly welcome the way that they are working closely with the rest of the international community, including the United States and our allies, Japan and South Korea, to implement these sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that sends an important message just as a symbolic matter. \xc2\xa0But once these sanctions and restrictions are imposed, it will have an impact on North Korea. \xc2\xa0But it is an open question about whether or not that impact will prompt the kind of change that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see in North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, something simple just on Donald Trump. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve been very strong about Donald Trump in the past. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about his divisive rhetoric. \xc2\xa0But can you speak to the fact now that Donald Trump is not denouncing David Duke, someone who is a former grand dragon of the KKK, as well as a former neo-Nazi before he was a member of the KKK -- a grand dragon of the KKK.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Listen, I know Mr. Trump has indicated that there\xe2\x80\x99s more that he needs to learn about Mr. Duke before he can offer an opinion about their endorsement. \xc2\xa0But I do think that this reveals all we need to know about Mr. Trump, and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think voters will come to their own conclusions. \xc2\xa0I think the bigger concern, frankly, is that you have members of the Republican Party who are trying to have it both ways. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that they are condemning the decision of the Republican frontrunner to accept political support from this divisive, offensive figure in the country, but yet they\xe2\x80\x99re still vowing to support that person if they become the general election candidate of the Republican Party.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure how you square those two things, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to figure that out, I guess, over the course of the next eight months or so as this is publicly litigated.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I want to ask you one more thing. \xc2\xa0As someone who deals with the press -- friendly-adversarial relationship; we have a very close relationship -- it seems that Donald Trump has now -- he has a member of his press corps who is a white supremacist, and he has a radio show. \xc2\xa0What do you think about that and the possibilities of that possibly coming here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I have to admit I have not seen those reports. \xc2\xa0As you know, when it comes to our policies for people who sit in this room and participate in this briefing, there is no sort of ideological screen that we put in place. \xc2\xa0I think there are people who represent a variety of points of view in this room, including people that, the vast majority of whom represent a point of view that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on just getting the facts straight and sharing those facts with their readers and viewers and listeners.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we regularly protect the ability of professional, independent journalists to do their job. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the independent press corps, the White House press corps, the professionals who work here day in and day out have an important responsibility, and they\xe2\x80\x99re critical to the functioning of our democracy. \xc2\xa0And hopefully, whoever the next President is will continue a tradition that has a tendency to transcend political party.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I have some questions about baseball, but don\xe2\x80\x99t get too excited, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the Royals. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Someday we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the briefing where somebody wants to have a long conversation about the Royals. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We can do that sometime. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to hold you to that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the New York Times reported that Major League Baseball has submitted a proposal to allow Major League Baseball teams to directly hire Cuban players. \xc2\xa0And as part of that report they said the White House has been talking behind the scenes with League officials about how to navigate that regulatory environment. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can elaborate on those behind-the-scenes talks -- who\xe2\x80\x99s involved. \xc2\xa0And should we expect a ruling from the administration on this before the President attends the game in Havana later this month? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a division of the Treasury Department called the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and they have responsibility for regulating the restrictions that are currently in place that apply to commerce between the United States and Cuba. \xc2\xa0Since the President announced the change in policy a little over a year ago, there are a number of those regulations that have been changed and altered in a way to begin to normalize relations between our two countries. \xc2\xa0And it is not at all uncommon for the administration to offer advice to U.S. businesses that are seeking to ensure that their actions are firmly in compliance with those regulations. \xc2\xa0So the kind of conversations that you\xe2\x80\x99re alluding to are not unusual and holy appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tIs that an answer to your question? \xc2\xa0There are several parts to your question, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I covered all of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah, I guess the second part is, do you expect some kind of announcement on a new policy toward Cuban players by the time the President attends the game later this month?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0But you should check with the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0And again, OFAC can provide you some additional information about the regulations that would apply in this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one more. \xc2\xa0Congressional Republicans I guess saw this announcement, and they were a bit irked because they said the White House is making a big deal about going to this game, but they haven\'t announced any kind of solid meeting with political dissidents yet. \xc2\xa0Do you have a response to that? \xc2\xa0And is there any plan -- are you going to announce some kind of set meeting with those dissidents in the coming days?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think when we first announced that the President was going to travel to Cuba, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor stood at this podium. \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about a baseball game, but he did talk about the fact that the President will certainly meet with dissidents in Cuba. \xc2\xa0And part of that is because one of the priorities of our policy is to apply the best interests of the Cuban people and get the Cuban government in a position where they are better protecting the basic universal human rights of all Cuban people, including people who might be critical of the government. \xc2\xa0That is an important part of our policy. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of our priority here -- is to empower the Cuban people, who want to protest and want to offer their dissent in public, to have the freedom to do so. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we believe that we are more likely to achieve that aim by deepening and increasing our engagement between the American people who enjoy those freedoms and the Cuban people who, in many ways, do not at this point. \xc2\xa0And that will certainly be an important part of the trip. \xc2\xa0That was something that we discussed on the very first day. \xc2\xa0But the truth is, I think the President, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, for different reasons is looking forward to both meeting with political dissidents in Cuba and attending a game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national baseball team.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to just follow up on Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s question about the turnout in, you mentioned, Virginia -- how the Democratic leader, Hillary Clinton, she had more votes for her than the winner in the Republican primary, Donald Trump. \xc2\xa0But the overall turnout for each party, the Republicans had over a million voters turn out; Democrats had about 775,000 voters turn out. \xc2\xa0Does the White House or do the President or you -- do you doubt the ultimate Republican nominee\xe2\x80\x99s ability to unite the party and bring together the full amount of primary voters around their general election candidacy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. \xc2\xa0I know that there are some Republicans who doubt that the current Republican frontrunner has that ability. \xc2\xa0But they would certainly know better than I do. \xc2\xa0When it comes to the raw turnout numbers, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that there were more Republicans who showed up at the polls, because there are more Republicans in the states that had elections last night. \xc2\xa0So when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Oklahoma, Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee -- these are all states with sizeable Republican voting populations. \xc2\xa0The Democratic states involved were quite a bit smaller -- Vermont, for example. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that the overall numbers are tilted in favor of Republicans. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I singled out states like Virginia and Minnesota, where the Democratic candidates -- in the case of Minnesota, both Democratic candidates got more support than any of the Republicans that were on the ballot. \xc2\xa0And in Virginia, you saw that the leading vote-getting of any of the candidates that were on the ballot was a Democrat. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s significant because anybody who shows up at the polls can choose either a Democratic or Republican ballot to vote for the candidate of their choice. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear sign that the candidate with the most support in Virginia right now is a Democratic frontrunner. \xc2\xa0And given the important role that Virginia has played in the last two general elections, I would anticipate that Virginia will play an important role in this general election. \xc2\xa0And that seems to bode well for the Democrats right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You also mentioned that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that Donald Trump would necessarily be helpful -- you said he may not be helpful to the top of the ticket. \xc2\xa0Does the White House believe that the House could be in play if Donald Trump is the nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there certainly are lots of people who will weigh in on both sides of this argument. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there are Democratic strategists who believe that the House would not be in play if Mr. Trump were at the top of the ticket. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask them if they think that it\xe2\x80\x99s in play because he\xe2\x80\x99s at the top of the ticket. \xc2\xa0I can assure you that Democrats right now are mounting a serious effort to retake the majority in the House because they believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s possible. \xc2\xa0And they certainly are doing the important work on the front end to make that happen, regardless of who the Republican candidate for President is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then just one quick follow-up on your opening statement. \xc2\xa0You mentioned about the U.N. Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s resolution that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t target the people of North Korea directly. \xc2\xa0Is there anything that the international community is doing that would help compensate for any adverse effects that would be directed unintentionally to the North Koreans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0To the North Korean people? \xc2\xa0Well, look, the truth is, there is a significant population of North Korea citizens who are suffering right now. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re suffering because of the policy decisions made by the leadership of that country. \xc2\xa0The leaders of that country have chosen to prioritize that country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear and ballistic missile programs over meeting the basic needs of its citizens. \xc2\xa0That is grossly immoral, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that that country\xe2\x80\x99s leadership has made. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why putting in place sanctions that would have an impact on their nuclear missile programs and have an impact on the lifestyle of the ruling elite in North Korea does put pressure on the regime that they haven\'t seen before. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, we\xe2\x80\x99re just a couple of hours after the United Nations Security Council has passed this resolution. \xc2\xa0But as it goes into effect, it will have an impact on North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s programs -- or their ballistic missile and nuclear programs. \xc2\xa0It will have an impact on the ruling elite. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if it ends up having an impact on their ultimate strategic choices.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it seemed like your opening statement was specifically talking about the unintended consequence of its citizens that are supposedly innocent in this, right? \xc2\xa0So is there anything that was addressed when the resolution was drafted? \xc2\xa0Or is there anything that the administration is considering now that would help compensate any sort of adverse effect directly on its people? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anything like that is possible, frankly. \xc2\xa0You have an authoritarian regime in North Korea that essentially is taking all the money that\xe2\x80\x99s flowing into their country that they can get their hands on, and devoting it to their lifestyle, their country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and their country\xe2\x80\x99s missile program. \xc2\xa0And they do that in a way that has a negative impact on their people. \xc2\xa0In fact, it has an impact on the ability of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s population to feed themselves and to provide for some of their basic necessities. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an appallingly immoral choice, and one that the international community does not condone. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut one of the challenges here is you have a country that\xe2\x80\x99s so isolated -- you have an authoritarian government that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to allow money into the country that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get their hands on. \xc2\xa0That\'s why what we\'re trying to do here is to focus our efforts on those revenue streams that we know benefit those areas that we\'re concerned about, which is specifically their nuclear program and their missile program.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, in order for the needs of the North Korean people to be met, we need to see a North Korean government that\'s making different decisions, and actually making decisions that are in the best interest of the day-to-day lives of the North Korean people. \xc2\xa0Thus far they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been willing to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you keep saying these sanctions on North Korea are going to hit the North Korean elites. \xc2\xa0Do you believe that they will be felt by Kim Jong-un himself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no expert when it comes to understanding the North Korean economy. \xc2\xa0What we do know is that the North Korean elite in general does benefit disproportionately from some of the revenue that\'s generated by their gold and their iron and their titanium exports. \xc2\xa0And so by targeting that, we hope to have an impact on their ability to fund their destabilizing activities and on their ability to fund the extravagant lifestyle that they enjoy at the expense of the North Korean people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you don\'t see these as specifically targeting the leader himself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding is, based on the sanctions that have been put in place, there are not sanctions that target him personally. \xc2\xa0But again, the North Korean people have suffered enough. \xc2\xa0And the way that these sanctions and restrictions are designed, it\xe2\x80\x99s to have an impact on those revenue streams that benefit the ruling elite and that benefit their destabilizing activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You took quite a while in negotiating this with the Chinese. \xc2\xa0Does the White House see this as a breakthrough with China, a new direction for their client, to be tougher on them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly does reflect a greater commitment on the part of the international community to taking steps against North Korea that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never taken before. \xc2\xa0And China voted for them. \xc2\xa0China worked with the United States in a series of intensive, high-level diplomatic discussions to reach an agreement and commit to implementing these sanctions. \xc2\xa0I do think that it represents an increased capacity for the United States and China to coordinate our efforts when it comes to North Korea. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the United States and China that are taking action here. \xc2\xa0This is something that Russia voted for, and this is all taking place with the full support of our closest allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked in the past about really needing China on board with this, not just the U.N. Security Council. \xc2\xa0But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem -- while it does hit North Korean elites, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem explicitly to say it\xe2\x80\x99s freezing accounts in China and elsewhere. \xc2\xa0Is there an assumption that China is going to also take unilateral action like the U.S. did today in adding more sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I was just going to say that -- that there are some additional steps that the U.S. government did announce today that are complementary to this U.N. action, and separate from the congressional legislation that was passed last month on this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what you do see is you see the United States ramping up our activities, too. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to China, we\xe2\x80\x99ve long acknowledged that China has unique influence and a unique relationship with North Korea. \xc2\xa0They have a more active relationship with the North Korean regime than any other country in the world. \xc2\xa0We know that the North Korean economy depends more on China than any other country in the world. \xc2\xa0So they do have unique leverage.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we also know that China is quite concerned about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities. \xc2\xa0We know they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about their ballistic missile activities. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see China using their influence and demonstrating a willingness to coordinate their efforts with the rest of the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it would seem that while the U.S. is hailing this as the toughest bit of sanctions in 20 years, in more than two decades, it still allows the regime a lifeline -- otherwise, the Russians and Chinese wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have signed up for it. \xc2\xa0The Russians said that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the economy to collapse. \xc2\xa0So this goes farther than before, but still allows the regime to survive. \xc2\xa0Would you acknowledge that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think only time will tell exactly what the impact is of these sanctions. \xc2\xa0But there is no denying that these sanctions go farther than we have before, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that these sanctions will have a tangible impact on the North Korean ruling elite, on North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s missile program and on North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, all of which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quickly on SCOTUS -- you said we\xe2\x80\x99re now in the most frustrating part of covering this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling our pain. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Do I take that as understanding the next time we hear an update from you, it will be that you\xe2\x80\x99ve sent a nominee to the Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get your hopes up. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not get my hopes -- but you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have a photo of the President carrying a binder like we had before? \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have a photo of a bunch of Senate leaders coming to the White House again? \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule those things out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can that be scheduled?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get your hopes up that the next thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear us talking about when it comes to the Supreme Court is the President announcing a decision about a nominee. \xc2\xa0His work continues, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best to keep you updated.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I saw some reports that President Obama endorsed Ted Strickland in the Ohio Senate race. \xc2\xa0Is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is true. \xc2\xa0The President also announced an endorsement of Congressman Patrick Murphy in Florida, as well. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s also involved in the Senate race.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I\xe2\x80\x99m not wrong, Strickland voted against a bill that included the federal assault weapons ban. \xc2\xa0He said, in 2004, he was against the assault weapons ban. \xc2\xa0He opposed the city of Columbus\xe2\x80\x99s assault weapons ban. \xc2\xa0He opposed the Brady handgun bill, and was endorsed by the NRA for reelection in 2010. \xc2\xa0Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President say in a highly touted New York Times op-ed that he would not support candidates who do not support common-sense gun control measures? \xc2\xa0And is this the kind of record of candidates that the President will support going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Byron, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed before, what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on are candidates who will support and will promise to support common-sense gun safety legislation. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to Mr. Strickland about the policies that he would support as a member of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, an individual\xe2\x80\x99s record matters, but when it came to that particular promise, it related to -- or gave candidates the capacity to change their mind. \xc2\xa0After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we need to see. \xc2\xa0We need to see more people in the United States Senate -- in the United States Congress change their mind and embrace common-sense gun control, gun safety legislation that could prevent at least some incidents of gun violence without undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for Mr. Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s current position on these issues, you should check with him or his campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that you think, going forward, he would be a good candidate on these issues, and one that the President could support? \xc2\xa0Because that was a litmus test that the President drew in his op-ed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement is pretty strong. \xc2\xa0But, again, for Mr. Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s position on those issues, you should check with him or his campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was a report this morning about an ISIS significant operative and then key operative being detained, captured in Iraq somewhere. \xc2\xa0Inasmuch as targeting the leadership is a significant aspect of the U.S. strategy there, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen to those individuals? \xc2\xa0Where will they be taken and where will they be held? \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s the judicial process that they will face -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re alive, presumably?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot about this that I can say. \xc2\xa0I can tell you in general that the President directed the Department of Defense to stand up an expeditionary task force because we have seen this tactic yield some important results. \xc2\xa0There have been at least one raid that has been publicly discussed that was carried out by U.S. special operators against a high-ranking ISIL official; this was last year. \xc2\xa0And that raid resulted in the death of that high-ranking official, but it did allow U.S. special operators to obtain significant quantities of valuable intelligence information. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the Department of Defense, recognizing and following the President\xe2\x80\x99s instructions to intensify our efforts that are yielding some progress, decided to create these expeditionary task forces to operate inside of Iraq and to carry out raids on relatively short notice against leading ISIL figures.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, I can\'t discuss the details of any missions, particularly when it comes to risking operational security. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that one of the goals of this expeditionary task force is to capture ISIL leaders, but these operations will be carried out in coordination and in partnership with the government of Iraq. \xc2\xa0Any detention of ISIL leaders in Iraq would be short term and coordinated with Iraqi authorities. \xc2\xa0And one of the things that you know about the one raid that\'s been carried out that\'s been reported publicly is that the individual who was detained in that raid was an individual who was subjected to an interrogation where important intelligence information was obtained. \xc2\xa0And then that person has been turned over to Kurdish authorities, and is currently in the Kurdish criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you can\xe2\x80\x99t say if or how many other ISIL figures have been detained?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, I cannot. \xc2\xa0There may be additional guidance the Department of Defense can share with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t say -- or can you say what the -- you said short term they\xe2\x80\x99ll be held. \xc2\xa0Where long term are they going to be held?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can rule out a couple of things. \xc2\xa0These individuals would not be transferred to the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0There is no one that\xe2\x80\x99s been transferred to that prison during President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s seven years in office. \xc2\xa0Our goal is to close that prison. \xc2\xa0Adding to that population would be contradictory to that goal. \xc2\xa0I think what the Department of Defense will tell you is that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make their own determinations about the best way to handle these individual cases. \xc2\xa0When it came to the case of Umm Sayyaf, the wife of the ISIL leader who was detained in that raid, she was turned over to Kurdish officials, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be brought to justice in the Kurdish system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So none of these individuals will ever come to the United States?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check with the Department of Defense about how they would resolve those cases.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the case of Mrs. Sayyaf, there is a DOJ warrant for her arrest based on providing material support to terrorists, something -- whatever that is. \xc2\xa0So why would someone like that not be brought to the United States to answer to a warrant issued by the Department of Justice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to the Department of Justice about that. \xc2\xa0Their specific warrant that they filed related to alleged crimes related to Umm Sayyaf\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in taking an American citizen hostage. \xc2\xa0And so those are very serious crimes, and that\'s a warrant that\'s been filed.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow the Department of Justice wants to pursue that is something that they will decide, and you should ask them for their latest update. \xc2\xa0But right now she is in the custody of Kurdish law enforcement officials and she is being brought to justice in their system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you answered -- you kind of answered my next questions. \xc2\xa0Because that case involves an American citizen, why is there not a case to be made that that person should be prosecuted in the court system in the United States so that there\xe2\x80\x99s justice done here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think for how the Department of Justice will proceed, you should check with them. \xc2\xa0But obviously, they have made filings in an American court. \xc2\xa0So I think that the possibility that you have raised is probably not one that they would rule out. \xc2\xa0But that also is going to involve a conversation with law enforcement authorities who are currently holding her.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So just to be clear about it then, the administration policy -- and I know we can talk to each individual department -- but the administration -- is there a clear policy that says no ISIL figures will be brought to the United States? \xc2\xa0Or is there a policy that says clearly under certain circumstances, some of these individuals detained on the battlefield could end up in the United States?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just try to be helpful -- as helpful as I can here, given the constraints that I\xe2\x80\x99m operating under here. \xc2\xa0What is true is there have been situations where individuals have been picked up on the battlefield around the world. \xc2\xa0These are terrorists who were actively plotting against the United States or our interests. \xc2\xa0Those individuals in some cases have been brought to the United States. \xc2\xa0They have gone through Article 3 Courts. \xc2\xa0They have been charged, they have been convicted. \xc2\xa0And they currently are serving time on American soil in American prisons.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if something like what you are describing were to happen, it would not at all be unprecedented. \xc2\xa0In fact, our system has demonstrated its capacity to handle these kinds of challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the thing that I will go back to, though, is that our principal goal when it comes to the expeditionary task force is obtaining information that can be valuable in our campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we made clear that when Umm Sayyaf, the wife of the ISIL leader, was detained, that she was interrogated for intelligence purposes prior to being put into the Kurdish criminal justice system. \xc2\xa0That sort of process is one that is in place any time U.S. officials detain an accused terrorist. \xc2\xa0But there is a process for sending professional interrogators in to interrogate the individual to obtain as much information and intelligence as possible; if necessary, to obtain information about potential plots or potential threats so that those threats can be mitigated or even eliminated. \xc2\xa0Then, where appropriate, those individuals can then be turned over to law enforcement officials who can conduct an investigation and obtain information that could be used in a civilian court of law. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a process that was created and implemented under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, and it is one that has resulted in important terrorism convictions against individuals who sought to do harm to the United States or our interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You made a point earlier on SCOTUS when you said that the White House has now talked to every office of every United States senator. \xc2\xa0In the past, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple names -- Kirk, Ayotte, maybe others -- who have indicated a willingness to let this process go forward with the nominee, to some extent. \xc2\xa0Now that you\'ve talked to every senator, do you think, or can you give us any other names of individuals on the Republican side who you think are willing to essentially break with the leadership and let this process go forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Obviously, there are a lot of Democrats who believe that this process should go forward. \xc2\xa0I think all of them do.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to Republicans, I\xe2\x80\x99ll allow them to announce their own views. \xc2\xa0We have seen, as you point out, statements from Senator Kirk and Senator Collins from Maine. \xc2\xa0I don\'t believe that Senator Ayotte has indicated a desire to put her constitutional duty first. \xc2\xa0This is something that she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to decide for herself and something I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that she\xe2\x80\x99s considering.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, we\'re going to be making a case to Senator Ayotte and others about the priority that we believe they should place on their constitutional duties. \xc2\xa0I think most of their constituents believe that their constitutional duties should come ahead of any more narrow political considerations that they may have.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Do you know Judge Jane Kelly? \xc2\xa0Have you ever heard of her? \xc2\xa0Have you ever met her? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve read some public reports about her, but I have not met her in person.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you seen her here, by chance? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s clever. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes? \xc2\xa0Nothing?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, nothing on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say with any certainty that anyone who might be under -- I know we\'re going to run through this every day. \xc2\xa0Have you seen anyone that you can think of who might be a candidate for the Supreme Court, a potential nominee inside this building?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, even if I had, I don\'t think I would say so from here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does that mean, yes, you have?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It means that if I have, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say so from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right, fair enough. \xc2\xa0On Gitmo, do you have any announcements to make about potential detainee transfers? \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that a few times and have spent a little bit of time. \xc2\xa0I know the process is moving forward on a few. \xc2\xa0Might you have any announcements today or the coming days?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t anticipate any announcements today. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check and see if there are any that are in the pipeline. \xc2\xa0We probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t announce them in advance just because of the diplomatic work we have to do with other countries. \xc2\xa0We need to coordinate our announcements with other countries who are agreeing to take in these detainees under the security precautions that the Secretary of Defense has certified are necessary. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t have any additional transfers to tell you about right now. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To the best of your knowledge, at least today, is there any effort, plan, discussion or initiative underway that we\'re aware of to alter the status of the naval station at Guantanamo, including not making payments, transferring it over to a caretaker body, or abandoning it altogether? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any plans like that. \xc2\xa0But for the way that the military base at Guantanamo Bay is maintained, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, let me just take another run at that very quickly. \xc2\xa0Should we expect any announcements about the military base at Guantanamo Bay during the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Cuba?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that the President is not planning to visit the military facility on this trip. \xc2\xa0So I guess not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not. \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Andrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I wanted to ask you a little bit about Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Jordan and the West Bank. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you could tell us whether the President asked him to go; and if so, for what purpose, what aim.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, we did just recently announce that the Vice President is traveling to the Middle East. \xc2\xa0I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s going to stop at the UAE and Jordan in addition to Israel on this trip. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have an opportunity to meet with leaders in each of those countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed preview of his trip to share with you. \xc2\xa0Obviously, when it comes to our efforts to coordinate our international counter-ISIL coalition, countries like Jordan and the UAE have played important roles in that. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that will be a subject of discussion. \xc2\xa0It certainly was a subject of discussion when King Abdullah was here in Washington, I believe that was just last week. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that discussion will continue when the Vice President travels to Jordan. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a little bit more on his trip as it gets closer to his departure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read this as a sign that the Vice President is going to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s possible in terms of steps that could reduce tensions between the Israelis and the Palestinians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for any U.S. leader to travel to Israel and to meet with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders and not have that issue come up. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that it comes up every time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut to the extent that -- to the precise nature of those discussions, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office for now. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get you some additional information before he departs to help you understand what the goal of his trip exactly is.</p>\n<p>\n\tAngela.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, Director Comey and Attorney General Lynch said that they don\xe2\x80\x99t think that new legislation is needed to compel -- or to allow law enforcement to crack phones in the Apple case. \xc2\xa0Is that the official administration position, that the existing law gives law enforcement the ability to get into phones if necessary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just the opinion of the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, it\xe2\x80\x99s also the opinion of at least one federal judge in California, who, based on a filing to the Court by the FBI, suggested that Apple should cooperate with those efforts. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just one very specific case. \xc2\xa0That is a case that is being led by independent federal law enforcement investigators, and they are focused on learning as much as they can about the terrorist incident in San Bernardino so that if there are additional steps we need to take to protect the American people, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s one very specific case. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s where this argument was applied, and a federal judge agreed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anything the White House does want in legislation on this topic right now? \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously movement on the Hill to write some sort of a bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly will be in touch with members of Congress about that kind of legislation. \xc2\xa0And we would welcome a productive conversation about that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say that at least I personally harbor some skepticism about whether or not that\'s something that Congress can successfully complete just because this is a really complicated topic and we\'ve seen that even simple, straightforward measures have some difficulty getting through this Republican-led Congress that has been reluctant to embrace their government responsibilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another topic -- former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, on CNN this morning, became the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic officials to say that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy and how well he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is causing concern among world leaders. \xc2\xa0The President obviously has frequent meetings and phone conversations with these world leaders. \xc2\xa0Is this something that\'s coming up in those conversations? \xc2\xa0And is he finding himself in the perhaps awkward position of having to assure his counterparts in other countries that the U.S. is on solid ground, despite what may happen in November?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not at this point prepared to get into a detailed discussion of the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with world leaders. \xc2\xa0The President himself has observed many times that other countries around the world closely follow our politics and they\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the ongoing debate in this country and the upcoming election to choose the next President of the United States. \xc2\xa0So the stakes are significant, and other countries recognize that. \xc2\xa0But for the reaction that is shared by other world leaders, I\'ll let them talk about that publicly if they choose to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, a quick follow-up your response to Kevin. \xc2\xa0You said that the President isn\'t planning to visit the Guantanamo Bay base on this trip. \xc2\xa0Is he planning another trip to Cuba?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of. \xc2\xa0But if we do, we\'ll let you all know. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Just one quick one. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, House Speaker Ryan came out against the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciary rule, a conflict-of-interest rule. \xc2\xa0A lot of business groups have been running ads against that. \xc2\xa0Is the White House prepared to try to change that or reconsider that before it\'s finalized?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is a process for considering these kinds of rules. \xc2\xa0It\'s going through that regulatory process right now. \xc2\xa0The President and the Secretary of Labor have both been pretty clear about precisely why we believe this rule needs to be changed. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now, because of decisions that are made by financial advisors across the country, about $17 billion in retirement savings is wasted. \xc2\xa0When we\'re talking about the need for more middle-class families having greater access to retirement security, that\'s money we need to protect, particularly when you consider that this is the hard-earned income of workers from all across the country. \xc2\xa0That money is wasted because there are some financial advisors that are not obligated to put their customers\xe2\x80\x99 financial interests ahead of their own. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound right.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is, for the vast majority of financial advisors who do follow those rules, this law -- or this rule, this regulatory action wouldn\'t require them to do anything differently. \xc2\xa0This would just be a rule that would apply to those financial advisors that don\'t currently commit to putting their customers\xe2\x80\x99 interests ahead of their own.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we see this as a common-sense change that could have a substantial, positive impact on middle-class families that are working really hard to try to save for retirement. \xc2\xa0That\'s a good thing. \xc2\xa0And this is exactly the role that government should play.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So then you\xe2\x80\x99re proceeding forward on this and don\'t believe it needs to be delayed or reconsidered?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We believe that this is an important rule. \xc2\xa0This is a change that was announced I think almost a year ago now, so there has been a process in play here. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t have an update for you in terms of where we are precisely in that process, but given how long it\'s been playing out, I hope we\'re getting close to the end. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll see if we can get you an update, if that\'s necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you mentioned Ohio and Florida. \xc2\xa0Are there any other Democratic primaries in which President Obama is taking sides? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If the President does take sides, we will make that decision public. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I believe those are the only two Senate races -- or Senate primaries where the President has weighed in with an endorsement. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t rule out additional decisions about endorsing candidates. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What is his thinking when he involves himself in a primary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President evaluates the record of the candidates; he evaluates their performance in the campaign thus far. \xc2\xa0And obviously, I think we\'ve certainly seen over the last year or so how the country and how the Democratic President benefits from having a Democratic majority in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0That\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the President do a couple of trips to raise money for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \xc2\xa0And I certainly wouldn\'t rule out the President campaigning aggressively for Senate Democratic candidates in the general election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Pre-primary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know that we would necessarily do any campaign stops pre-primary. \xc2\xa0I guess I wouldn\'t rule it out, but that would probably be more the exception than the rule. \xc2\xa0But I would expect that over the course of the fall you would see the President working hard to support Democratic candidates for the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the outreach to senators, what is the principal message that the White House offers to the senators or their offices? \xc2\xa0Is it exclusively about holding a confirmation hearing and a vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that\'s one of the virtues in this argument that we\'ll make and have been making, which is that the message that we\'re delivering publicly is the same as the message that we\'re delivering privately. \xc2\xa0It\'s pretty persuasive. \xc2\xa0The United States Constitution does not include an exception for election years. \xc2\xa0It insists that the President fulfill his constitutional duties every year that he\'s in office for all four years. \xc2\xa0It similarly insists that senators fulfill their constitutional duties for all six years that they remain in office and that they do not -- in the same way that the President is not appointed or elected to a three-year, one-month term -- senators aren\'t elected to a five-year, one-month term. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re in office for six years, and we expect them to do their job for that entire six years.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other argument that we\'ve heard from some Republicans is that somehow this is something that should be decided by an election. \xc2\xa0I was asked about this yesterday, and I made the observation that in some ways this actually was decided by an election -- the one that was convened in 2012 with a lot of fanfare, and President Obama won. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Chairman Grassley has weighed in on this in the past. \xc2\xa0Back in January of 2006, he said something that attracted my interest today. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cA Supreme Court nomination is not a forum to fight an election. \xc2\xa0It is the time to perform one of our most important constitutional duties and decide whether a nominee is qualified to serve on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest Court.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s right about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any chance the President mentioned that in the meeting with Grassley yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t believe that the President mentioned that in his meeting with Chairman Grassley yesterday. \xc2\xa0But I did notice that he delivered these remarks on the floor of the United States Senate, so, presumably, there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for all of you to see the words coming out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoyal, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0A quick question. \xc2\xa0As far as this upcoming nuclear summit is concerned, this is the first time that many things will be happening in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0Of course, President Obama will be there. \xc2\xa0And two, on nuclear and North Korea and other threats are going on that whoever has nuclear weapons and maybe ISIL or those threats are -- those countries. \xc2\xa0And I\'m sure this summit will address those issues. \xc2\xa0And also, Prime Minister Modi -- this will be the first nuclear conference as far as the Prime Minister is concerned. \xc2\xa0What message you think will be different than the last one this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Goyal, you alluded to one of them, which is that the last time the Nuclear Security Summit was convened, there was intense concern about the possibility that Iran was on the verge of obtaining nuclear weapons. \xc2\xa0Their breakout period was just a couple of months. \xc2\xa0But because of the recently completed international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed in a verifiable way to never obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in the meantime, there are significant limitations that have been placed on their program that included a 98-percent reduction in their nuclear stockpile, unplugging thousands of centrifuges and a number of other modifications that can give the international community ongoing confidence that Iran will not obtain a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0So that certainly is one thing that I would anticipate will be discussed at the summit and represents tangible, important progress that makes the region and the world safer.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m confident that North Korea will be the subject of some discussion. \xc2\xa0Obviously, we continue to be concerned about their flagrant violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that do apply to their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0I\'m confident that there also will be an extensive discussion about the need for other countries around the world to engage effectively with the international community to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials and other nuclear equipment. \xc2\xa0That\'s an important priority, primarily because we know there are extremist organizations like ISIL that would love to get their hands on those materials. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo safeguarding those materials and safeguarding that equipment is a top international priority, and the United States, through the forum of a Nuclear Security Summit, has been able to make progress in securing loose nuclear materials in a way that has enhanced the safety not just of the American people but of the entire world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last, as far as this election is concerned, talking to many minority groups in the past two weeks or so, they are very much worried about what is going on against minorities -- many statements during this election -- are concerned. \xc2\xa0What they\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying is, that as far as -- under Obama, they are very safe, they have been safe because President Obama has been protecting minority rights in many ways. \xc2\xa0And also during Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s statement, she said that she will continue as far as President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s mission and concern as far as minorities are concerned -- issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy question is that, how much do you think minority will play a role in this coming elections? \xc2\xa0Because one poll is saying that minority votes will decide who will be the next President of the United States because of the unity that\'s going on among these groups in the country that vote who will be the best President for the U.S. and for minority rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Listen, Goyal, I think we have heard quite offensive rhetoric coming from a number of Republican candidates for President, and there has been an attempt on the part of a number of Republican candidates to marginalize and single out and treat differently American citizens because of the way they look, because of the color of their skin, because of the sound of their last name, and in some cases, because of the religion they choose to practice. \xc2\xa0All of that flies directly in the face of the kinds of values that all Americans cherish. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is, it\'s not just racial, ethnic and religious minorities in this country that have been offended by that Republican rhetoric. \xc2\xa0It\'s a whole lot of Americans, including Americans that don\'t fit those categories, that have been grossly offended by that rhetoric and by those political tactics. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I do anticipate that there will be an opportunity for us to have a robust debate about those values and priorities in a general election. \xc2\xa0And I do feel confident that whoever the Democratic nominee is will be somebody who will present a stark contrast to the rhetoric and values and offensive views that are occasionally spewed from the podiums occupied by Republican candidates for President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And as well, do you think the President will be talking about these issues in the coming months -- a message for the minorities and other groups in the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m confident in telling you that in the general election, the President will be lifting up the kinds of values that our country has long cherished. \xc2\xa0And that certainly includes a commitment to ensuring that everybody in America has an opportunity to succeed, regardless of their last name, or the color of their skin, or the way they choose to worship their God. That\'s what makes this country great, and it certainly is a message that you will hear from President Obama and Democrats up and down the ballot this fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
