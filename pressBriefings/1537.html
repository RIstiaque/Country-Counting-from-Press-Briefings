Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  2:38 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has he talked to Gates?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 I have almost all the confidence in the world that whatever I say is not going to make the news tonight.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But in my role I am happy to answer questions.\xc2\xa0 Actually, Marissa handed me the -- my folder and said, "The week ahead is in the front pocket."\xc2\xa0 I said, "I have a sneaking suspicion we\'ll get to that toward the end."\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has not spoken to Professor Gates, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anybody from the White House reach out to Professor Gates to let him know that the President was going to do this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any form of apology from the President in this conversation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President characterized most of their conversation as something that he wanted to have with the officer, and I\'ll keep it that way.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How real is this offer?\xc2\xa0 He said a beer, I mean, that\'s one thing you just throw out there.\xc2\xa0 But is it, like, how about --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it was the suggestion of the Sergeant and I think the President in their probably about five-minute phone conversation --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he inviting the Sergeant to come to the White House?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you be quiet?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he inviting the Sergeant to come to the White House?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We did not hear your last words --</div> <div class="legacy-para">[Cross-talk.]</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Where did we leave it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Five-minute conversation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In about a five-minute conversation -- I have to go back and check my notes, I think it was Sergeant Crowley\'s suggestion about the beer and I think the President thought it was a good idea.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to schedule it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this a serious --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as he said, he doesn\'t know if it\'s scheduled but they\'ll work on it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he is inviting the Sergeant to the White House?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to talk into the microphone, we all heard your question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, I think as the President said, and I think that\'s why the invitation is a real invitation, is that a moment like this can be used to teach us and be used to have a communication and a dialogue that\'s constructive outside of the moment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when did the President decide to make this phone call and what prompted him?\xc2\xa0 Was there any particular event or conversation that prompted him to do so?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Sometime earlier today, but I don\'t know the exact time that he decided.\xc2\xa0 The call happened -- it lasted about five minutes.\xc2\xa0 It was -- let\'s see, my watch is set ahead -- so it was probably around just recently, 2:15 p.m., 2:20 p.m.<br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After he came back from the education event?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you know if he plans to speak with Professor Gates?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know, but I will check on that when we\'re done.</div> <div class="legacy-para">April.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, this is significant that the President had to come back and address a question from a press conference because of its nature of race.\xc2\xa0 Why kind of communiqu\xc3\xa9s or letters or calls have you gotten here to the White House and what kind of outpouring have you gotten from the community for the President to make this decision?\xc2\xa0 And did police organizations from around the country help to make this decision for him to come out and make this statement?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I was on the road yesterday, April, so I don\'t know what engagement the White House had yesterday with groups or individuals.\xc2\xa0 I think I did see on the correspondence chart that we get that health care was the biggest topic again yesterday, in terms of comments and concerns.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s all the information I have on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a follow up, also.\xc2\xa0 Since he acknowledges that race is still an issue and there are sensitivities still about race, as this issue has proven, is he thinking about possibly doing something along the lines of what Bill Clinton did, possibly having a conversation on race at some point?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think in many ways the question, the answer, the events, I think we\'re having that conversation.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s a separate initiative, I don\'t think it\'s an announcement.\xc2\xa0 I think the President would say that these are important issues that play out in our daily lives and will and should be discussed in our daily lives.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, from listening to him it sure sounded like he had made an apology to the officer.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t it be fair to characterize it as that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he -- Steve, I think he understood that, as he told you all, that his words contributed to this being ratcheted up.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think there\'s a reason that the news media is on the Sergeant\'s lawn.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and he wanted to make sure that -- to let him know that that word choice was not one that he thought was probably, in hindsight, the best choice.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you in the room during the call?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you hear him issue an apology?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re not asking --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t make us parse this --</div> <div class="legacy-para">[Cross-talk.]</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to parse it, you can quote me and you can quote him.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to parse --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not asking you to characterize his remarks --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we\'re asking what you heard.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I feel comfortable with the answer I just gave Steve.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did you hear him make an apology?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get -- if the President doesn\'t want to characterize it in a conversation he\'s having with you all, I\'m not going to get ahead of him.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, prior to the President going out for that press conference, obviously you sit down, you go over the questions that are going to be asked for the evening, and you rehearse answers or discuss how he will answer questions.\xc2\xa0 Did this come up as part of the preparations, the Gates matter?\xc2\xa0 And if so, was his word choice of "stupidly," did that -- was that ever --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the process in all of this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was discussed about that question?\xc2\xa0 I mean, when that -</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into how we --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you shocked when the President used those words?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My opinion on that doesn\'t matter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you anticipate that there will, in fact, be a meeting here at the White House?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President hopes so.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President hopes that, again, this is a moment that can be used to discuss these issues.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when do you expect them to reach out to Mr. Gates?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said I\'d check on that, so I don\'t know the answer to that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what part of his statement would he take back -- anything other than the word "stupidly"?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, you just heard from the President.\xc2\xa0 I would quote him liberally, and I don\'t want to get into parsing him.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick thing.\xc2\xa0 He said that, "because of our history, African Americans are sensitive to these issues."\xc2\xa0 I want to make sure he is referring -- is he referring to Mr. Gates and his response, or is he referring to the President\'s own response to the issue and to the question asked at the press conference?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think he\'s talking about -- I think he\'s talking about writ large.\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s talking about -- I think that statement -- well, I know that statement does not -- he\'s not speaking about an individual situation, he\'s talking about -- and the reason he came to work on an issue like this in a state senate was because of historical tension.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not an individual thing, that\'s writ large.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I mean is when Lynn Sweet asked the question he could have dodged it.\xc2\xa0 He jumped into it.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if he is saying that it\'s because of a sensitivity -- he feels sensitive --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he addressed it up here in saying that he has heard those that said maybe because it was a local issue it\'s something that he should have or could have steered around, and I think he was clear on that here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions, sir, please.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as health care issue is concerned, most of the Indian American physicians and doctors in this country they support President\'s initiative.\xc2\xa0 But also (inaudible) his six months in office, most of the issues.\xc2\xa0 The question is that as far as small businesses are concerned some of them have concern that how they will pay for their employees and now as far as the health issue and immigration both are related to them, that they want to hear from the President how they will deal with that issue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me address health care and small business.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is a topic that the President has spent quite a bit of time on throughout the week in meetings with -- in town hall meetings, in meetings with the Blue Dogs, in meetings here today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously millions of businesses are struggling with the high cost, the skyrocketing cost of health insurance that gets harder and harder each day to provide for their employees.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the things the President wants to see come out of health care reform are ideas that will cut costs for small businesses and allow those that are providing insurance for their employees to be able to do so more affordably for themselves and hopefully encourage others that want to do that, but have shied away from it because of the cost, to be able to do that as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, as far as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\'s visit to India, what kind of message -- what sort of message she was carrying from the President?\xc2\xa0 She\'s now back and meeting with the President and reading the report.\xc2\xa0 And do we have a new road map as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned in the future?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not talked with the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 I know the Secretary of State met with the President for lunch today to discuss the trip, but I have not had a chance to discuss the trip.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what\'s the lesson -- if this is a teachable moment, what does the President want the country to take away from this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as he said yesterday and I think as he said today, and I think as even he said at the news conference, you had a call come in and you had an officer respond to a call about a potential break in.\xc2\xa0 And as I said yesterday as well, there was clearly a point sometime after that where both sides could have stepped back a little bit and maybe we wouldn\'t have had all of this play out the way it has.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think he understands the enormity of the job that law enforcement has and I think he spoke today about the tension that has been there with -- in some African American communities with law enforcement, and that working together and having that dialogue and in communicating we can make things better for both involved.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he going to do over the next month to try to keep up the momentum of health care?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll go through some on the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 I know we\'ve got -- he\'ll travel on Wednesday to Raleigh, North Carolina, and a not-yet-picked-city in Virginia, to continue to discuss health care reform and the need to get it done.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is safe to say that we had always assumed the President would continue to talk about this and other important issues like the economy and energy even while Congress was back at home.\xc2\xa0 So there will be a busy month of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said in southwest Virginia?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was this morning, and it\'s now not-yet-confirmed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve never heard of a not-yet-picked-city, Virginia.\xc2\xa0 Is there any place like --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s just south of southwestern, Virginia.\xc2\xa0 If I knew where it was, Chuck, I would --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\'t even (inaudible) the region anymore, or we should back off --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not unless you can pinpoint not-yet-confirmed, Virginia.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that has come up since the President\'s statement at the news conference, the quote his health care plan will not add to the deficit, is the letter from six days before with the CBO study, signed by its director, Doug Elmendorf, who said that the plan, H.R. 3200, if enacted would add $239 billion to the deficit by 2019.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\'s reaction to the CBO scoring?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, like -- I don\'t have anything specific on what they say happens in the 10th year of that 10-year window.\xc2\xa0 I can simply reiterate for you what the President has now said on any number of occasions, that health care reform legislation that he signs will not add to the deficit and he means that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he disagrees with Director Elmendorf?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why would he -- he\'s not evaluated from a budgetary perspective H.R. 3200, that\'s not his job.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 One other question and it\'s a housekeeping matter.\xc2\xa0 Based on this morning, are you going to restore the gaggle as a permanent part of the briefings?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I look forward to and enjoy meeting with you all on an almost constant basis.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I hope so.\xc2\xa0 I hope so in a way that we can meet some of your earlier deadlines, talk about issues off camera, and hopefully Margaret will continue to bring doughnuts.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us if the President has ever had any personal experience that he spoke about in the last couple of days from his time in Cambridge, when he was attending school at Harvard?\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of any of that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I have -- not that I\'ve heard in the past couple days or that I have heard in the several years that I\'ve worked for him, no.\xc2\xa0 I think it was brought up yesterday when I was gaggling that there was -- there\'s a story in the Chicago Tribune from 2003, I think around the time he was working on the issue of racial profiling, that he mentions a suspicion of that but not -- I don\'t think it makes mention of a specific incident.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has referred to Professor Gates as a friend.\xc2\xa0 Do you know how long they\'ve known each other and can you explain the nature of their friendship?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I don\'t know how long they\'ve known each other or the depth of that, but I can certainly -- I can talk to the President at the end of this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering, do you know if the President has decided not -- if he would sign a health care bill that does not have a public option?\xc2\xa0 He\'s never said if that is a line in the sand.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he has discussed in his principles the strong need to provide choice and competition and his belief that a public option provides that for millions of Americans who in different health exchange markets are not going to have access to competitive plans.\xc2\xa0 And I think he -- as I said, outlined that in his principles and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress is coming under increasing pressure about the public option, and that\'s why I was wondering if --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it seems a lot of issues around health care that are that way.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Wendell.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on my calculations, about half of the savings the President is counting on to fund two-thirds of the health care reform comes from Medicare and Medicaid, if you can follow my math --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Half of two-thirds -- I think I got it, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A third.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you, Chip.\xc2\xa0 Much better suited than me, obviously.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Given that Medicare itself is in fiscal trouble -- I mean, 2017, the trust fund expires -- how can the President be counting on any savings from Medicare to expand the availability of health insurance?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Understand, Wendell, the reason it\'s going bankrupt quickly is the amount of money that is in the trust fund and the obligations with which that trust fund is being drawn down on.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I\'ve heard the President talk a lot about what the status quo means.\xc2\xa0 The status quo means that we\'re going to continue to spend -- or health care is going to continue to climb at a rate of roughly three times that -- increase three times the rate of wages; that we can\'t continue to spend the type of money we\'re spending on health care and then not expect it to bankrupt our government.\xc2\xa0 So clearly we have to put Medicare on a different spending trajectory.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the President addressed the fact that -- on Wednesday, the fact that he believed that we could do that without in any way threatening the quality of benefits, and I think that\'s why the AARP has come out in favor of health care reform and why the pharmaceutical manufacturers and the drug companies have denoted that we can squeeze some savings out of the system and also put some money into actually filling the gap in Medicare -- that exists in Medicare Part D for seniors on drug expenses and actually do it in a way that\'s paid for, which would be unique for that program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\'t any Medicare savings needed to save Medicare?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if you are spending -- if your obligations are less, you\'re going to by definition take a trust fund and draw down on it less rapidly, and I think it will extend the life of that and put it on a path towards sustainability that we all recognize is tremendously important.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Blue Dog talks on health care reform failed in the House Energy Committee.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think they continue to meet so I think I\'d be a little -- I don\'t know that I\'d rush to the fact that they\'ve failed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Congressman Ross came out today and said that they failed, that talks are impossible.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know they\'re continuing to -- they\'ll continue to meet and I think everybody is -- I know that the meeting that was had here at the White House that lasted three hours was seen as productive and I think they\'ll continue to do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on health care?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wednesday night the President said the only way you get anything done in this town is by setting a deadline.\xc2\xa0 With August 7 no longer seeming to be an operable deadline, would he like to establish a new one -- end of September, a date in October -- would you care to -- by Christmas?\xc2\xa0 But seriously, I mean, is there --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this, I think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- taking him at his word from Wednesday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I think -- look, David, I think that we have made progress in many ways because the President did, as he has said in interviews over the course of the week, poke and prod and set some I think what he would think of as meaningful goals for achievement.\xc2\xa0 I think the President characterized the fact that Senator Reid\'s announcement yesterday was okay because he sees that we\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 He\'s in regular communication with members of the Finance Committee.\xc2\xa0 He met with Senator Reid and Senator Baucus here at the White House today in what I think both sides thought was a productive meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Regardless of August, as I described just this morning, we\'re going to -- we were always going to have to come back in the fall and reconcile legislation, go through the process again before something got to the President\'s desk.\xc2\xa0 I think the President continues to believe strongly that we can see health care reform this year, this fall.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the House deadline -- the House passing before the end of August is a nice thing if it happens --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The end of August, or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, the beginning of -- before recess -- the House getting a bill by next Friday would be nice to have but not a demand at this point?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is encouraged as long as he and the administration and those on Capitol Hill feel like we\'re making progress, and that\'s where we are.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he like to see that bill passed if it meant taking it out of -- you know, sort of going around the Energy Committee because of the Blue Dog issue or would --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t talked to our folks on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Mark.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what gave the President the impression that there was a media frenzy and his message wasn\'t getting through?\xc2\xa0 He often says he doesn\'t read -- watch cable news much.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you tell him, did staff tell him -- you need to address this; it\'s getting out of hand?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was with him yesterday -- I was with him yesterday, but the reports on cable TV were that this was taking up a lot of real estate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you told him that; you let him know\xc2\xa0 --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A number of people I think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he speak to anybody on the outside about this issue?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\'t one of these things where he was talking to an old friend or something?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was there any discussion of him issuing a written statement rather than coming in?\xc2\xa0 It\'s incredibly unusual, what he did here today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And miss the opportunity to see you guys?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- the notion that the President wanted to come -- I don\'t know who\'s laughing back there -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 If you laugh like that, we\'ll move you up to the front row, that\'s -- no, the decision to come in here and tell you all about it was the President\'s decision.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Lester.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just for clarification, the President has actually apologized to that Cambridge police sergeant, hasn\'t he?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I think I answered this three times for --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell us yes or no?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I feel comfortable with -- I feel comfortable with my answer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Robert, on Baucus-Reid --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us on Baucus-Reid, did the President leave the conversation thinking that -- or confident that there will be an agreement or something coming out of Senate Finance before August?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s the way Senators Reid and Baucus, it\'s my understanding, have characterized the meeting, that they feel like they\'re making progress, and I think the President believes that, too.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that\'s the -- the President -- as long as the President feels like we\'re moving in the right direction, he feels good.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Mike.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President noted over the last two days that Congress doesn\'t act unless there\'s a deadline, which he\'s got plenty of evidence to back that claim up over generations of congressional history.\xc2\xa0 You put down your marker that you wanted a vote in both Houses of Congress some weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 You pulled out all the stops.\xc2\xa0 You had press conferences, town halls, impromptu statements and so forth.\xc2\xa0 You were unable to meet that goal -- at least, leaders were unable to deliver.\xc2\xa0 What is going to happen now over the course of August that\'s going to change people\'s minds and move votes?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Press conferences, statements, speeches.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, Mike, the -- August isn\'t being re-jiggered to address health care.\xc2\xa0 We always knew for months that we would be discussing this issue and that it would be -- whether it made it through the House and the Senate before the recess or after the recess, that the recess itself would be a critical period of time in which we would mobilize the President\'s voice in travel to address what he feels like is an issue that we can\'t avoid addressing any longer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think you\'ve heard him talk this week, describe in very personal terms, what the status quo means.\xc2\xa0 And I described it today a little bit as -- on some legislative issues, the notion that if you don\'t do anything, if you don\'t get reform or improvement, then everything just stays where it is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Well, I think the President has taken the last several days to explain to the American people that status quo on health care means more people lose their insurance, families pay more money for their premiums, more people are discriminated against based on preexisting conditions in trying to seek insurance.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what doing nothing means.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think he\'ll continue to press the case for what doing nothing means, and continue to press the case for the principles that he\'s outlined to cut costs for families and small businesses, make it affordable, make it accessible.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are the things that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet members have heard these arguments over the course of the last three and four weeks and they\'re still reluctant to vote with the leadership, Democratic leadership.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but again, I think -- Mike, I think -- I mean, we, despite that, have had meetings here today that we think have been productive.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that our staff will be working this weekend with committee members on the House and Senate side, as well as next week, on making progress.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the President certainly is a strong believer in the fact that you can continue to talk and work some of these issues through; that sitting down and having that dialogue is important to try to make that progress, and he\'s still optimistic that we can.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, has the President expressed any disappointment that the outrage surrounding this, the Gates incident, has focused exclusively on his word choice and not on the circumstances of Professor Gates\' arrest?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- I think the President explained in his statement what he felt like he had unnecessarily contributed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my second question was, when talking to the President, has he ever talked about contrast between the Senate leadership, the majority leadership under his administration versus under the Bush administration?\xc2\xa0 Has that ever come up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In what way?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of party unity, that sort of thing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- I have not heard him discuss that.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him talk about that at all.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give a little bit more of a readout on the Baucus-Reid meeting?\xc2\xa0 Was it mostly logistics and planning and timetable, or was it also substance, talking about compromise --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was -- there was obviously committee process discussions as well as, as it was told to me, issues of substance dealing with issues that remain unresolved in the committee.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the last few days, he has expressed an interest in either taxing health care benefits and Cadillac plans or penalizing insurance companies that offer that.\xc2\xa0 Did the President express still in interest in that or even say he supports those ideas?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know exactly whether or not that came up or in what form.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The swine flu -- at least 300 people have died in this country from the swine flu and many more around the world.\xc2\xa0 How close are we to the medicine or to the shot or whatever they\'re going to have for it -- especially now the fall coming and we have the other flu coming?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there are regular meetings here at the White House hosted by senior White House officials, including John Brennan and others, to continue planning for what the President and his administration talked about earlier this year -- that what we saw building up and that affected communities throughout the country and honestly affected countries throughout the world, hit in many ways at the back end of our own flu season, which in many ways probably likely gave us the preview of the depth and severity of what we\'ll face come fall.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'re taking steps, working with state and local officials, working with communities, working with school districts, to ensure that they have the best information about what steps can and need to be taken to get ready for what we know is coming.\xc2\xa0 Obviously many countries around the world we\'ve seen a preview of the taxing nature that this is going to provide -- the ability with which this is going to test our health infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And I know the team is working through decision-making on -- and the development of production for antivirals and developments for a vaccine.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the CDC doing and what are they saying?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Their language hasn\'t changed much from in the spring, again, when we faced this situation.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of things that we can and need to do to get ready for what we know is going to happen.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in many ways -- in some ways, we\'re fortunate that when we experienced this, again, like I said, it was at the end of our flu season.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not likely to be that lucky in the fall, and I think the severity of the flu requires us to be ready at all levels of government to address what is clearly going to be a busy, busy flu season.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, week ahead.\xc2\xa0 See, I almost forgot.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for answering lots of people\'s questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to do it, Lester.\xc2\xa0 It\'s my j-o-b.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you bring him out every day?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do what?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you bring him out every day?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be fun.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but I noticed attendance was kind of light for him today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\'m going to tell him not to take that too seriously.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The weekly radio address is -- not surprisingly -- on health care, and I think there\'s a briefing call on that in about 20 minutes and we\'ll have that out fairly shortly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President will spend the weekend in Washington and has no scheduled public events.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you guys saw the guidance a little bit later tonight with the parade at the Marine barracks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">On Monday morning, the President will address the opening session of the first U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton and Secretary Geithner will chair the dialogue with the Chinese Vice Premier and State Councilor.\xc2\xa0 Later the President will meet in the Oval Office with the President of FIFA, the international soccer body.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cool.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Really.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are they talking about?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dribbling, heading --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Health care?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good point.\xc2\xa0 No, they\'ll -- I think the United States has a bid in on a future World Cup and they\'ll discuss that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just had it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We just had it -- what are you --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The World Cup --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'re a football --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he confirmed going to South Africa for the opening games?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know he wants to go, but I don\'t think anybody has confirmed it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said you wanted to go.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Both of us do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Both of us do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President will also -- really -- welcome the WNBA Champion Detroit Shock to the White House.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President and the First Lady will host a reception for ambassadors.</div> <div class="legacy-para">No details on Tuesday, except attending meetings and an event here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">As I mentioned, on Wednesday the President will hold events on health care in Raleigh, North Carolina, and a soon-to-be-determined city somewhere in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</div> <div class="legacy-para">On Thursday, the President will meet with the President of the Philippines here at the White House, and attend meetings at the White House here on Friday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be -- is there going to be a joint event?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll do something in the Oval on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">All right, thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 3:20 P.M.
