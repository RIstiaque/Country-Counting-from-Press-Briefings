CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 It is Monday, June 6, 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before we get started I just want to give you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 D-Day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is D-Day, a magnificent day in our history and the beginning of the end of the Nazi regime.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me give you a brief readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s monthly meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan, if I may.\xc2\xa0 The President led his monthly meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan with his national security team this morning.\xc2\xa0 The session lasted nearly two hours.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During this session, the President received briefings on progress in implementing our strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan following the death of Osama bin Laden.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By video, Secretary Gates briefed the President on his recent trip to Afghanistan in preparation for the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming videoconference with President Karzai, which will take place on Wednesday, June 8.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The group also discussed our strategic partnership with Afghanistan and the progress being made to build and sustain the Afghan national security forces.\xc2\xa0 The President also received an update on our efforts to ensure effective cooperation with Pakistan against al Qaeda and other violent extremists.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among the participants, of course, were the Vice President; Secretary Clinton; Secretary Gates, as mentioned, via SVTC; Chief of Staff Daley; National Security Advisor Donilon; John Brennan; a variety of others -- Admiral Mullen, Leon Panetta, et cetera, et cetera.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll put that out on paper for you as well.\xc2\xa0 And with --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you make a still available?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will make a still available.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xc2\xa0 Standard practice.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions.\xc2\xa0 Darlene.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Did they -- did the President not discuss drawing down U.S. troops during the AfPak meeting?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that not a topic of discussion?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was not a topic of discussion.\xc2\xa0 It was not on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 The President has not received yet a recommendation from his commanders or the Secretary of Defense for a troop drawdown figure.\xc2\xa0 That will obviously be a decision he makes relatively soon in keeping with the commitment he made when he announced his AfPak strategy back in December of 2009, that a drawdown would begin in July of 2011.\xc2\xa0 But this was not a subject of today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect his announcement this month, or in July, the troop --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on scheduling.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the operative date here is July 2011 in terms of the beginning of the drawdown, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said in April that -- in an interview with AP, that the drawdown was going to be significant, and then Gates recently said it was going to be modest.\xc2\xa0 So can you sort of -- is it going to be significant?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, as I said, Darlene, the President has yet to make a decision on the numbers.\xc2\xa0 We have always said that it would be real.\xc2\xa0 There were skeptics who suggested at the time when the President announced his policy that the July 201 date for the beginning of a drawdown was not real.\xc2\xa0 It will, in fact, begin then.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to make his decision, as he has said all along, based on conditions on the ground, not whether or not there will be a drawdown, or the beginning of a drawdown, but the size and scope and pace of the drawdown.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, again, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made the decision, but it is -- he will make it fairly soon.\xc2\xa0 In an interview earlier today he talked about the fact that this will be a summer of transition and has talked about some of the progress we have made in the mission, including obviously the elimination of Osama bin Laden, the fact that we have taken the fight to al Qaeda effectively, and have al Qaeda back on its heels; there has been some stabilization in Afghanistan, some real progress, that our mission there has achieved; and that it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a process that is underway of transferring security lead to the Afghan national security forces.\xc2\xa0 And that process obviously will reach its culmination, as promised in Portugal, at Lisbon, at the NATO conference, will reach its culmination in 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a speech to the nation for this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a forum or a format or a venue yet for you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he will make a decision and then inform the public of his decision.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- speculation not withstanding, I would not put too much credence in that at this point, because he has not yet made a decision.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President gave an interview to a German newspaper over the weekend ahead of Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s visit tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He said that the two sides agree on some things and disagree on others.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about some of the things that they disagree on?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99d need something a little specific than that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the IMF, and specifically funding for Greece, which is looking for further -- possibly further bailout money?\xc2\xa0 Does the United States, and will the President specifically, encourage Germany to provide that funding in Europe, or would the United States support IMF money going into that again?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said and what we continue to say, Jeff, is that our European -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in constant communication with our European counterparts about Europe\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal -- financial situation, rather.\xc2\xa0 They said -- they have said that they will do whatever is necessary to tackle this problem, and we believe it is completely within their capacity to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more specifics about it, but that is our position.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can -- somebody might hear that and say in \xe2\x80\x9ctheir capacity\xe2\x80\x9d means the U.S. does not want IMF funds, which would, by nature of the IMF, be using U.S. funding as well to go towards Greece.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting more specific, I think that by saying that it is within their capacity to do that, we believe that they are capable of handling this challenge successfully.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in addition to that issue, can you give us kind of a feel for what else will be discussed between the two leaders tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a vital relationship, obviously.\xc2\xa0 Germany is an important partner of ours globally, not just in Europe.\xc2\xa0 And the President very much looks forward to meeting with the Chancellor again.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the number of meetings they\xe2\x80\x99ve had, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve been numerous.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to her visit and to the meetings that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have, because it is a very important partnership.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President like to see Germany more involved in foreign policy issues such as Libya and Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will discuss the range of foreign policy issues that are out there that are of common interest to both countries.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the relationship is important, the cooperation is excellent, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will talk about those issues as well as many others.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question on that.\xc2\xa0 Is this a state visit or an official visit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Now, my understanding, there is a nomenclature here that has to do with whether the visitor is a head of state or a head of government, and my understanding here is that because she is head of government, that this is an official visit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it announced as a state visit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a semantic technicality.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s official.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a state dinner tomorrow, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is a state dinner tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We can get you some of the details of the distinctions, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark must have gotten the invite.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just awfully glad that she\xe2\x80\x99s coming as head of government of the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I help out with this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, please.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Officially it\xe2\x80\x99s an official visit, with a state dinner.\xc2\xa0 And the distinction is as you mentioned.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was right, is what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying.\xc2\xa0 I always like it when -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Anybody else have something similar to say about my -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It will be -- it will be (inaudible) personal meeting, according to the President in the interview, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Tapper.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the same way that the President asked General Cartwright to give him an alternative plan when he was coming up with the -- when they were coming up with AfPak plan back in 2009, is he soliciting proposals from any other generals or any other individuals in government as an alternative to the recommendation from the commanders that he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is the case.\xc2\xa0 What needs to be understood here is that the debate and discussion about the President\xe2\x80\x99s AfPak policy took place, as you know, in the fall of 2009 and resulted in the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision of the policy that we have been implementing as an administration ever since, both militarily and through our civilian agencies.\xc2\xa0 This decision about the size of the initial drawdown is one in keeping with the decision the President made back in December of 2009.\xc2\xa0 There is not enormous debate about this, despite some reporting to the contrary.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the context for this decision is fairly narrow, which is what -- the President is, as he has all along, moving to the next stage of implementing a policy that he thought long and hard about in making a decision that he made in the fall -- or rather late 2009.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So he looks forward to the recommendation that he gets from his commanders through Secretary Gates.\xc2\xa0 I believe if there are options contained within that recommendation I\xe2\x80\x99m sure those options will be reviewed and discussed.\xc2\xa0 The way this process normally works, it\xe2\x80\x99s rare that there is simply one alternative put on the table.\xc2\xa0 But I do not expect a -- this is not a reopening of a process that was completed in December of 2009.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Gates has said he expects the drawdown to be modest.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that the recommendation coming from Gates --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that depends on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is going to be anything other than a range of modest drawdowns?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it depends on how you define what \xe2\x80\x9cmodest\xe2\x80\x9d is or \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d is.\xc2\xa0 The President -- it will be a real drawdown, but it will depend on the conditions on the ground, which he relies on his commanders to inform him about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, there will be, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, some discussion about how you implement that decision, but the policy decision has been made.\xc2\xa0 This is a step along the way of implementing that policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday night, the House -- or Thursday, rather, the House passed a resolution saying that the President has roughly two weeks to provide a whole bunch of information and answer a whole bunch of questions about the Libya military operation with the not-so-veiled threat that the Defense bill is coming up and that funds for that operation could be withheld if answers are not forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration intend to answer all of the demands from the House for information?\xc2\xa0 And has the administration sought at all the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel at Department of Justice, as to how closely or whether or not the White House is in compliance with the War Powers Act?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jake, we believe that we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution on the issue --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did you seek OLC\xe2\x80\x99s guidance on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any special seeking of guidance that we asked for.\xc2\xa0 We believe we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the question of congressional consultations and the answering of questions, there have been numerous briefings, both classified and unclassified briefings, on the U.S. participation in the NATO mission as well as in -- on our other actions with regard to Libya.\xc2\xa0 And those consultations will continue.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that those consultations -- within those consultations there are questions asked that we can answer, we will answer them without question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we feel confident that, A, the President is executing a policy decision that he made in exactly the manner that he said he would; that our consultations have been consistent, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re acting consistently with the War Powers resolution; and finally that we would welcome and support a resolution similar to or exactly like the Kerry-McCain resolution in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to provide any paper?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just if --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if they ask for paper, we may provide paper, but only as part of the general consultations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having.\xc2\xa0 It is simply incorrect to suggest that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been informing or consulting with Congress regularly on this important matter, because we have, and we believe it is important to consult with Congress on things like this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that Congress --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House is suggesting it very, very clearly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would say that in response to that, we have consulted regularly and we will continue to.\xc2\xa0 And we will answer questions regularly, as we have.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound -- correct me if this interpretation is wrong -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like you take this House resolution very seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said it was unhelpful, and we think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important, as we continue to act with our partners, to implement United Nations Security Council 1973 and implement the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, the non-lethal actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken unilaterally and multilaterally -- that we continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve made enormous progress.\xc2\xa0 We think the progress will continue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been encouraged by the steps taken by the opposition in Libya.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been encouraged by some of the declarations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made about their support for democratic reform.\xc2\xa0 And we are encouraged by the regular indications that those around Muammar Qaddafi are beginning to realize that the future of that regime is very bleak and that the Libyan people need to be the ones who will decide who will lead them into the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just the House has passed this resolution fairly handily, clearly indicating they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like they\xe2\x80\x99ve been consulted enough, demanding a list of information about this operation.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful -- you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to provide the information --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that at all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in written form unless they specifically request it.\xc2\xa0 You might supply some of it; you might not supply other parts of this information.\xc2\xa0 They have the legal authority to cut off funding for the Libya operation, and the defense bill is coming up in a couple weeks.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned about this at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously take seriously our obligation to consult with Congress, and to the extent that there are questions that need to be answered, we will of course endeavor to answer them.\xc2\xa0 And we take seriously concern expressed by members about questions they have about our mission here.\xc2\xa0 We do believe we have acted consistent with the War Powers resolution and we do think it would be -- we would welcome the support of Congress in the form of a resolution similar to the one put forward by senators -- the bipartisan resolution put forward by Senators McCain and Kerry and others.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond that, again, it will depend on the consultations we have with Congress, the questions we can answer as we go forward, but we want to continue to keep the pressure on the Qaddafi regime and continue our support for the NATO mission, which is protecting Libyan civilians from Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is Congress has some questions --?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- you know how this works.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Afghanistan, can you give us a sense of the President\xe2\x80\x99s process in coming to a decision?\xc2\xa0 I mean, once he surveys his advisors, he sees where they are, what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 Is he consulting with outside advisors?\xc2\xa0 How often is he consulting with advisors?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he consults regularly with his team of national security advisors -- small \xe2\x80\x9cnsa\xe2\x80\x9d, not just his single National Security Advisor -- but members of his national security team on this issue.\xc2\xa0 He has his regular Afghan-Pakistan meeting that he had today.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will have additional meetings as he begins to consider the recommendations that he receives from Secretary Gates and General Petraeus, and then will evaluate the options before him and make a decision consistent with the original decision that he made in December of 2009 to begin the drawdown in July of 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he consulting with outside advisors at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- in general, the President sometimes seeks input from others who don\xe2\x80\x99t work within the administration.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he is doing that in this case.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is not a debate here about a policy.\xc2\xa0 This is the implementation of a policy that has already been decided on.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate the seeking of opinion in some broad circle beyond a team of national security advisors that he has a great deal of confidence in.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s getting some -- there will be some differing opinions.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s President.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has to make the final decision on these many issues.\xc2\xa0 I would say that everyone understands what the policy decision is -- the policy decision he made in December of 2009; the fact that the beginning of the drawdown will begin in 2011 and will end with the full -- or rather, the process that begins with the drawdown or has begun already but which the drawdown is a part of, which is a transfer of security responsibility to an Afghan lead across the country, will be complete in 2014, as spelled out in Lisbon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so this is a moment along the way -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an important one because it is the implementation of a key element of the policy decision he made in December of 2009, but it is a part of a policy decision; it is not a new thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the golf outing with the Speaker, what is he hoping to achieve with that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just resolve all their differences, 18 holes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll have three and a half hours.\xc2\xa0 I mean, really, what are they -- what is he --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, as the President has said, he likes and gets along with the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 They have obviously spent a fair amount of time together earlier in this year and late last year working on a number of important agreements that were reached, both the tax cut deal in December, and the continuing resolution which secured funding for the government, and spending cuts for the rest of 2011.\xc2\xa0 And obviously they have a lot to talk about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- this is more of a social outing.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- they will not, despite what I just said, they will not resolve the budget negotiations on the back nine.\xc2\xa0 At least I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any tears?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any tears?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will they share a cart?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ve worked out the -- you know how these things are -- they haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked out the fine details yet.\xc2\xa0 But they -- look, they get along very well, I think.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Who\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there -- is President Obama giving any thought to personally attending the next round of deficit-reduction talks later in the week?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President had asked his Vice President, Joe Biden, to lead these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say I think that the fact that he did that demonstrated the significance that the President places on these talks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As many of you wrote about or spoke about on air, the Vice President has been a key player in some major negotiations, including those that led to the agreement last December.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a fitting role for him to play given his strong relationships on Capitol Hill in both parties.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that process is important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very high-level.\xc2\xa0 It involves members of the Senate and the House, in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, appointed by their leaders, so we certainly hope that the leaders have faith in those they appointed to negotiate on their behalf.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously, as we get to -- closer to an endpoint in these negotiations, there will no doubt be direct presidential involvement, engagement in some form -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s phone calls or meetings or -- he is the President, and as with the decision he makes on troop drawdowns, that this will be -- when there is a deal, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident there will be a deal, this will be decision that he makes for the administration.\xc2\xa0 But he has a great deal of confidence in the progress the negotiations being led by the Vice President has made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any frustration at the White House about the congressional schedule?\xc2\xa0 One week Senate\xe2\x80\x99s here, the next week House is here.\xc2\xa0 Does that make it more difficult?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the talks continue, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have a meeting that the Vice President will lead on Thursday, despite the fact that one of the houses is out.\xc2\xa0 But we understand how this works, and that when you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing together members from both houses with members of the administration, that you have to work through scheduling conflicts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the status of discussions with Iraq on possibly keeping U.S. forces there beyond the end of the year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing new for you on that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say that we obviously are aware of the fact that we lost U.S. servicemen today, and we express condolences to their families once notifications have been made.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a stark reminder that those who serve in Iraq do so in a way that continues to place them at risk, despite the enormous progress that has been made there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And then on your question, I have nothing new to announce.\xc2\xa0 The process, as you know, is simply that we are abiding by the status of forces agreement that will have us withdrawing the remainder of our troops by the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 I and others have said that we will entertain requests by the Iraqi government if -- that we will entertain, in terms of discuss, possible requests for some sort of new status of forces agreement that would be obviously quite different from the one we have now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But as of now, we fully intend to fulfill our obligation under that SOFA and withdraw all our remaining forces.\xc2\xa0 As you know, since the President has come into office, we\xe2\x80\x99ve withdrawn 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq, and, again, according to the SOFA, we will draw down to zero by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Mullen said in April that without an agreement within weeks, soon, we would have to start making irreversible decisions, he said.\xc2\xa0 Presumably that means start bringing some troops home.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been bringing troops home consistently, and I think, obviously, there are 52 weeks in a year.\xc2\xa0 And we are moving along according to the existing agreements we have, but obviously we have different means of discussing with the Iraqi government whatever ideas they may have about any other kind of agreement we might reach.\xc2\xa0 But for now, we will keep the commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there have been no talks on a new SOFA since the -- since Admiral Mullen --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean -- I have nothing to announce on that.\xc2\xa0 I have no specific negotiations that are underway.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are in consultation with the Iraqi government on a regular basis through our ambassador, through our military commander there, and through others, but no talks in that sense.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s AfPak decision, is cost in any way a factor of how many troops are brought home next month?\xc2\xa0 Or the initial drawdown --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- does cost impact that at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, as I said before in response to a question regarding a story about this, obviously, as enormously powerful and wealthy we are as a country, we have limited resources, and we have to make decisions -- the President has to make decisions about priorities.\xc2\xa0 Having said that, his policy decision that he made in December of 2009 had as its objectives not -- had disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda, and stabilize Afghanistan so it would not become a haven for terrorists as it had been in the past, terrorists who have designs on the United States and its allies.\xc2\xa0 Those are the objectives, and the decisions he will make going forward regarding withdrawal and troop drawdowns will be based on the success of fulfilling those objectives and the conditions on the ground as he makes those decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And not cost?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly within the broader sense of we have limited resources, we have to make decisions about our priorities, obviously every decision is made with a mind towards cost, but this is about U.S. national security interests, primarily.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to close the loop on something you responded to earlier on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no -- the policy decision has been made.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not changing.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what\xe2\x80\x99s up to review.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is simply about the number of troops that come home, period.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, this is -- fair enough.\xc2\xa0 On Libya, the -- you said it was unhelpful.\xc2\xa0 Do you plan on responding to what the resolution called for, which is an explanation in 14 days?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you on that beyond my answer to the question about this earlier.\xc2\xa0 Again, we believe we\xe2\x80\x99re acting consistent with the War Powers resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you owe them any more explanation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we owe them in a sense that we owe -- and we have said repeatedly, both prior to and throughout this period when there\xe2\x80\x99s been a mission in Libya, that we feel obligated to consult regularly with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we have.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do they disagree?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are always disagreements in Washington about different things.\xc2\xa0 I think the overall thing that we agree on is that we need to make sure that the NATO mission succeeds.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure through the non-lethal measures that we have embarked upon that we continue to keep the pressure on Qaddafi, and ensure that Libya in the future has -- its people have the opportunity to choose their future.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we enjoy broad support within Congress for those goals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Senate has yet to pass this resolution -- you brought up Kerry-McCain --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t obviously control -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t control the congressional calendar, regrettably.\xc2\xa0 But the -- our position on that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 We believe that there is bipartisan support for the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking, and we would welcome an expression of it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know John Brennan is in the region right now -- Yemen -- has anybody in the administration been in touch with President Saleh in Saudi Arabia?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of with President Saleh.\xc2\xa0 As you know, John Brennan has been in touch with the Vice President, the acting President in President Saleh\xe2\x80\x99s absence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he asked him to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into the detail --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the same message to him as it was to Saleh?\xc2\xa0 Agree to this transition of power?\xc2\xa0 Could you expound upon what did he say --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the -- our position is that we support the agreement that President Saleh had talked about signing several times and didn\xe2\x80\x99t, which would lead to a transfer of power.\xc2\xa0 And we also have supported and we made calls for cessation of violence, and we mean that on both sides.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we want a peaceful and orderly transition, and that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the Yemenis\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional process; and we -- our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, and we believe that an immediate transition is in the best interests of the people and the best interests of maintaining stability in obviously a very unstable situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has Saudi Arabia been helpful to us on this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Saudi Arabia is an important ally of ours, and obviously John Brennan --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they helped the situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say they have been helpful, and as our -- as have others in the region who have worked with us and others to try to bring about a transition there that is best -- is in the best interest of the people of Yemen, and from our perspective in the best interest of the national security interest of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Fed nominee is withdrawing his nomination.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House or the administration already have other people queued up, considering Congress has blocked at least three or four nominees --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can say on that is that we will move quickly, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move forward as soon as possible with a replacement nominee.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this opportunity to, again, as I did on paper, express our disappointment with the partisan obstructionism that led to Mr. Diamond to withdraw his nomination.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is an enormously qualified candidate, and you know the process is broken when a Nobel laureate in economics is denied a post in the Federal Reserve.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.\xc2\xa0 And we regret that very much.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly echo the sentiment that Peter Diamond expressed in his op-ed this morning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is the impact -- I guess it may be hard to assess for him in particular for the Fed board -- but the impact of nominees not getting into their positions more broadly --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, more broadly, look, we have obviously a situation, when we talk about economic appointments, where this is a top priority of the President, it is the top priority supposedly of Congress, both parties, both Houses, and it is vital that we have people in positions, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s at the Fed or elsewhere, who are capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of the jobs that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been nominated for in the name of improving the economic situation in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And again, when you have highly qualified, highly regarded nominees for posts like this, they should be -- the Senate should act accordingly and allow that nomination to go forward.\xc2\xa0 And this is somebody, in the case of Peter Diamond, who had benefited from bipartisan support on several occasions through committee votes.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s very regrettable.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more question on Libya.\xc2\xa0 I know you were already asked this already, but if the administration has consistently consulted Congress, why do they continue to have so many questions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, it is their prerogative to have questions, and it is our obligation to answer those questions.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s partly how the process works.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with the fact that they have additional questions.\xc2\xa0 And we will endeavor to answer those questions, as we have throughout this process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Julianna.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House surprised by Peter Diamond\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was there more that the White House or the President could have done to get his nomination through?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s meeting tomorrow, the President in his radio address cited the European debt crisis as one of the headwinds that\xe2\x80\x99s leading to a struggling recovery now.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that he will stress with the German Chancellor tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be part of their conversation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the economy writ large is an issue that is of interest to both leaders and it is an issue that both are addressing in different ways.\xc2\xa0 So absolutely, as the President noted in his address and has noted elsewhere, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hit with obviously the fallout from the tsunami and earthquake in Japan, high energy prices, and the continuing drag presented by the European -- euro zone economic issue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that in many ways all three of those will be topics of conversation between the Chancellor and the President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the selection process for the next IMF head be part of the agenda?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President has made clear what his view is, which is we support the timetable laid out by the IMF and we support the selection of the most qualified nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect them to talk about Christine Lagarde\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy, specifically?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of that they would speak about a specific candidacy, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rule out what could be brought up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About a third of the troops in Afghanistan are not American.\xc2\xa0 Is there a sense that the decision the President makes on a troop withdrawal will influence what allies do?\xc2\xa0 And is there a fear that a precipitous withdrawal will take them out as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be anything -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a precipitous withdrawal -- precipitous being an adjective that suggests haste that\xe2\x80\x99s not thought through, perhaps.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the point has always been that this will be driven by a process that reviews the conditions on the ground, reviews the options presented by commanders on the ground through the Secretary of Defense, and will be very -- as reflected in the decision originally to -- with the policy decision he made in December of 2009 will be very deliberate and thought through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think we -- it is an international coalition.\xc2\xa0 We work -- we coordinate with our allies and we will obviously inform our allies of our decision once it\xe2\x80\x99s made.\xc2\xa0 But I think that the kind of cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve had there will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given that the last combat troops are scheduled to leave in 2014, in the context of a decade-long war, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a huge window.\xc2\xa0 So talk about why this first July drawdown is so significant, given that tens of thousands of troops will be out by 2014 regardless.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the beginning of a process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that when the President came into office, there were a certain number of troops and he has increased them significantly because of his focus on the need to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al Qaeda where al Qaeda central was located, in the AfPak region.\xc2\xa0 That is where the attacks on 9/11 emanated from and obviously, as we discovered not that long ago, the region where Osama bin Laden himself was hiding.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So he followed through on his commitment that he made in his campaign to refocus our attention on the original fight here, the fight that was so important, and we now have, because of the surge, so-called surge, reached a troop level that is allowing us -- has allowed us to make important progress in terms of stabilizing Afghanistan and beginning the process of transferring security lead over to the Afghan security forces.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are now at a point, as envisioned by the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, where we can begin the drawdown.\xc2\xa0 And the pace and slope will depend on conditions on the ground, but it will begin.\xc2\xa0 And I take your point, but obviously how that\xe2\x80\x99s spaced out between now and 2014 will -- there\xe2\x80\x99s some room to decide what that slope looks like.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- this is the first of those decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Scott.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that slope, the recommendation that the President gets, does he expect it to be more than just a July number?\xc2\xa0 How much of the glide slope will be outlined in this recommendation?\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s not fairly specific, do you revisit this every month in the monthly updates on how many troops we could bring back and when?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without anticipating or boxing in Secretary Gates or General Petraeus, I think that obviously this will be a proposal that looks at the situation we have now and envisions what the situation will be going forward.\xc2\xa0 But as has always been the case, the process will be revisited according to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it would be foolish to say that a certain portion will come out today and a certain portion on six months and three days from now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think that the answer is yes and no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there middle ground, though, I wonder, in the sense that you -- we know where you want to be in 2014.\xc2\xa0 You might not be able to put exact numbers to exact dates, but will there be certain mileposts you set down between then and now that you can revisit based on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I can announce from now.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to the President to announce what decision he makes when he makes it.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re still premature here because he has not even been given a formal recommendation by the Secretary of Defense on this.\xc2\xa0 So to anticipate how that will look I think would be foolhardy on my part.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In thinking about how he will convey this to the American people, do you think he will speak -- sort of review his policy and look forward over the next three years at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting ahead of the process here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will convey it.\xc2\xa0 Suggestions for how and the format are way ahead of where we are right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Helene.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can I go back to Julianna\xe2\x80\x99s question about Peter Diamond?\xc2\xa0 You said you thought that the White House did everything possible to push this nomination forward.\xc2\xa0 Can you just outline what all you did do?\xc2\xa0 I mean, did the President pick up the phone and call Mr. Shelby?\xc2\xa0 Did he --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a tick-tock on the different actions that different members of the administration took in support of this nomination.\xc2\xa0 We strongly supported it.\xc2\xa0 We thought he was highly qualified.\xc2\xa0 We regret that it\xe2\x80\x99s come to this and he\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawn his nomination for understandable reasons.\xc2\xa0 Again, he had -- enjoys significant bipartisan support, as he should have, given his qualifications.\xc2\xa0 And we think that the suggestion that he\xe2\x80\x99s somehow not qualified is just ridiculous because he is so qualified for this job.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And more broadly, it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to move forward in this process because these posts need to be filled precisely because we have such important issues before us in dealing with the economy.\xc2\xa0 And so we look forward to working with Congress, working with the Senate, to get the nominee who replaces Mr. Diamond confirmed and other nominations that are still pending confirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of message, though, does this send to other potential nominees?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s isolated.\xc2\xa0 I hope that the process can move forward.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that it\xe2\x80\x99s uniform.\xc2\xa0 We have had obviously some nominees move forward and we appreciate that and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see others move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, two questions on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Under the repeal law that President Obama signed in December, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t be off the books until 60 days pass following certification from the President, the Defense Secretary, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people who worked to pass the repeal legislation late last year are becoming worried if that certification doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take place before the end of this month, after September 4th, Secretary Gates retires, that there could be additional delays as we wait for Leon Panetta to come into position.\xc2\xa0 So does the President want to see certification for \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d this month?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the process is moving at the pace that we anticipated, and I also think that it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy and that it will be implemented regardless of who is Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President -- the administration is surely concerned that if we wait until Leon Panetta comes in there could be additional delays --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t share that concern, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you talk to us about the official relationship now with the United States government and the Taliban?\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates made some statements over the weekend, and if you could kind of flesh that out for us --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- you\xe2\x80\x99d have to be more specific about what kind of statements he made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was talking -- at the Asian Security Conference, he was talking about how in time we could work together, and things of that nature; there will be a relationship with the United States government and the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk -- give us any kind of information on that as the President is looking to draw down troops and bring everyone home by --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what this refers to is our oft-stated support for the reconciliation process that President Karzai has begun.\xc2\xa0 The important contingencies -- or rather, the conditions of reconciliation -- not contingencies but conditions -- are renouncing violence, renouncing terrorism, laying down your arms, and abiding by the Afghan constitution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So obviously there has to be a political settlement in Afghanistan, and obviously that would have to include elements of the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 And we support that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, if at some future date when there is, we hope, relative peace in Afghanistan and there\xe2\x80\x99s been a robust and successful reconciliation effort, the people who used to be members of the Taliban who are now reconciled into the Afghan government, and we have a relationship with the Afghan government, then obviously that would include elements of the Taliban from the past.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But again, the process for getting to reconciliation is not simply saying, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to reconcile.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going back to what you just said, elements of the Taliban from the past, there is a history there.\xc2\xa0 And I mean, are we at this point able to trust, to trust whatever the Taliban says and does?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s an important thing to make sure is clear here, which is this is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s being undertaken by President Karzai, who is President of the country and believes that reconciliation is essential for a long-term solution in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We support him in that and agree with him.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There obviously are irreconcilable elements, and we are taking the fight in Afghanistan to those elements, and have made progress and halted the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But going forward, reconciliation has to be a part of Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s future, and we support that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Steve.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President plays golf with the Speaker, will you ask them to let the pool see them tee off?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I could ask.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on the press circumstances surrounding that event as of yet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President has not been completely --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s way off in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- transparent about his golf game or let the pool see him start or finish.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President enjoys playing golf on occasion in part because it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice break.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many opportunities that a President gets to get outside and be away from the trappings of office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But in terms of the specific golf date that you mentioned, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you yet on how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to cover that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sam.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, first of all, is that your swing that you were showing us --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m a terrible golfer, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was hoping you could tell us a little bit -- considering the national security challenges that are on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plate right now -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, et cetera, you know the list -- and what we saw last week in terms of the economic recovery slowing down, could you talk to us a little bit in terms of how he\xe2\x80\x99s balancing these two?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t really have much of a choice when you become President.\xc2\xa0 These are the two priorities you\xe2\x80\x99re handed, and for good reason:\xc2\xa0 the national security of the United States, protecting the people of the United States at home and abroad, and the economic vitality, growth, and job creation of the nation.\xc2\xa0 And these are the two priorities that the President focuses on every day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And these are complicated times, and obviously when he took office, we were in economic freefall, and that was the focus, appropriately, of the media\xe2\x80\x99s attention, of the country\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s often lost -- or we forget sometimes that he also when he came into office inherited two wars that he had to spend a lot of time thinking about in terms of fulfilling his promise to draw down and end -- draw down troops and end the war in Iraq, a promise that he is keeping; and also the promises he made about how to successfully prosecute our effort in Afghanistan, another promise that he is keeping.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And these are -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice.\xc2\xa0 You have to do both, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just a reality of the office.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s such an important one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 I feel like I missed this over the course of the last few months -- I might have been on vacation or something -- but when did the President stop doing the daily presidential economic daily briefing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it happens periodically --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it used to be a daily thing with the PDB.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious when it stopped being a daily thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go check.\xc2\xa0 Again, it sort of happens occasionally, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen all the time.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was always the case, but I can check.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling changes to announce, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sam.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week an al Qaeda spokesperson released a video statement saying something to the extent of a good way to get access to firearms is through gun show loopholes in America.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how serious the White House is taking this statement, and also if they\xe2\x80\x99ve directed the Justice Department to look into the matter.\xc2\xa0 And how do gun control policies stand -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, gun control policy talks stand with the administration?\xc2\xa0 I know there was a task force that convened at the Justice Department a little while ago, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard an update since then.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I honestly am not aware of the statement that you mentioned, Sam.\xc2\xa0 And I would encourage you to go to the Justice Department on it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of any threats emanating from al Qaeda and take them seriously, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the appropriate folks are aware of it and acting on it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to send you to Justice for that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in the green.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President is playing golf; do you have his -- what is his handicap?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What is his handicap?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s classified.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Boehner giving him strokes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of that has been worked out.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is just an opportunity for the two men to spend some time together.\xc2\xa0 As the President has said, and I think the Speaker probably shares this opinion, that this is useful and valuable because they obviously both have a lot of responsibility for the kinds of decisions that need to be made in this country on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the fact that they can spend a few hours together playing golf I think is absolutely a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And how that game goes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be a foursome?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on who else will be playing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the debt ceiling, for the rest of the world, it is very difficult to understand what is going on in Washington because most of the country don\xe2\x80\x99t have those system, and for the rest of the world, it seems to be another political battle in Washington.\xc2\xa0 But this one is different in nature because this one put the entire international financial community in danger if the U.S. Treasury could default.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s your message for the international community?\xc2\xa0 And are you confident that you can resolve the issue by August 2nd?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are confident that Congress will vote to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 We believe that members of Congress have heard about the imperative here not just from us but from a variety of places and that that message is getting through; and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s been expressed by leaders of Congress of both parties.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And to your point, Toshi, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the international financial community that would be adversely affected by a default.\xc2\xa0 Everyone in this country would be adversely affected by a default.\xc2\xa0 The consequences for the economy would be very serious, very grave, and that would affect growth.\xc2\xa0 It would affect jobs.\xc2\xa0 It would affect retirement accounts.\xc2\xa0 It would affect every single American.\xc2\xa0 And to your point in terms of the global impact, it would affect people around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to take this vote.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is a different circumstance than exists in a lot of countries.\xc2\xa0 What people need to understand is that this vote, which is always one that the Congress is resistant to taking for understandable reasons, is to lift the debt ceiling in order to pay the obligations that the government has already made.\xc2\xa0 This is not a decision to spend money.\xc2\xa0 This is a decision to honor the obligations already made by the United States government, by the Congress, by administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And it has to be done because defaulting on our obligations, defaulting on the full faith and credit of the United States government would be a terrible, terrible idea with unpredictable consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.
