<h1>Briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 1/19/10</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:42 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Take us away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said something last week about the Massachusetts election that Ax sort of repeated today that I\'m intrigued by.\xc2\xa0 He said, "I think the White House did everything we were asked to do.\xc2\xa0 Had we been asked earlier we would have responded earlier." And that\'s similar to something you said I think maybe on Friday or Thursday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I was asked Friday why we weren\xe2\x80\x99t coming on Tuesday but were coming on Friday, and I said we had been asked.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand, but the implication here is that the White House, with an election this important to the majority and to your agenda and to health care, can\'t assert itself or won\'t assert itself into this issue and try to make a difference.\xc2\xa0 So can you talk about that a little bit?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously the President went on Sunday, lent his support for Martha Coakley, talked about why he believed she would be the best senator, somebody who has fought for middle-class, working-class folks in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>We\'re going to have plenty of time to get into the back-and-forth of all this.\xc2\xa0 I\'d prefer to do that when we know what the result is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it sounds like you\'re either saying that you don\'t want to assert yourself when something is important unless you\'re asked to do it, which seems a little weird, or that you\'re setting yourself up for this election to be lost by the Democrat.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, we\'ll have a chance to discuss the outcome of the election when we know the outcome of the election, which, as many people know, is ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, on another topic, tomorrow there are I believe six hearings having to do with the Christmas airline attack, Yemen, al Qaeda, Fort Hood -- six all in one day.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the object of that and how the White House is getting ready for that, how you want that to play out tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t know much about preparation other than -- I mean, obviously you\'ve seen John\'s report on both topics.\xc2\xa0 Obviously many of these hearings were announced after the incident but before these reports, and I think the administration obviously is more than happy to discuss what\'s in these reports, but more importantly, the steps that we\'re taking to address the concerns that these documents bring up.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been the President\'s charge to the team this entire time.</p>\n<p>I think you\'ve seen the President be quite open in discussing our failings.\xc2\xa0 The onus is on, now, all of us, both Capitol Hill and the White House, to ensure that we do all that we can to plug those shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the event of a Democratic loss in Massachusetts, what kind of contingency planning is the White House doing to prevent the -- to keep the health care bill alive as well as to keep everything on track?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously health care is a great priority to this President.\xc2\xa0 We can get into discussing the results of tomorrow, tomorrow when we have results.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But whatever the outcome of the election up there in Massachusetts, what\'s the thinking within the administration that this has exposed public skepticism, perhaps even backlash against the President\'s agenda, not just health care, but financial reform and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- I think to get into why something happened before it happens -- we will schedule a briefing not unlike this at approximately the same time tomorrow where we can discuss a lot of it.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forgetting the results of the election -- (laughter) -- the fact is it\'s incredibly close, right?\xc2\xa0 You guys have said it\'s an incredibly close --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a heavily contested election.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Heavily contested election in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that the fact that it\'s so close is any reflection at all on him or his agenda or his governing style?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, as I said to Matt, we\'ll have a chance to get into --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not talking about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand.\xc2\xa0 Let me finish the -- I think there is obviously -- and this isn\'t something that\'s known simply because there\'s an election in one state.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a tremendous amount of upset and anger in this country about where we are economically.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a surprise to us in this administration because, Jake, in many ways we\'re here because of that upset and anger.\xc2\xa0 That upset and anger, quite frankly, dates much farther back than simply the 2008 election.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to talk about any previous administration, except for quite some time the middle class has thought that Washington was looking out for Washington and the big special interests, and not looking out for them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s any doubt of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the President, who reads letters from people every day, will be in Ohio during a town hall meeting later this week\xc2\xa0 -- I have no doubt that people are going to express anger and frustration about where we are.\xc2\xa0 We have seen an economic downturn and collapse that we haven\'t seen since the late 1920s and the early 1930s.\xc2\xa0 I think that is going to be the source of, rightfully so, a lot of frustration, understanding that there were a lot of people that were hurting well before that economic calamity hit Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 Wages weren\'t going up -- you guys heard the President talk about this.\xc2\xa0 People were working longer, people were working harder, people were more productive even as their wages weren\'t growing.\xc2\xa0 So, look, the President understands there\'s a lot of economic frustration out there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you look at the right track-wrong track number, which I know you guys pay attention to, it was improving after President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 And it became that a majority of Americans at one point thought that we were on the right track, and that number has started to go down, even as the economy has continued to tank.\xc2\xa0 So it would seem that a lot of Americans are now attaching their frustration with Washington to President Obama and what he\'s doing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there is certainly some attachment to us.\xc2\xa0 I think there is some larger attachment to this town.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s an attachment to the pace of that recovery that you would count the President among those frustrated about.\xc2\xa0 The President is -- understands that there is frustration out there and is frustrated himself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you look at the polls on what the American people think about his handling of health care reform and the health care reform bill itself, they don\'t -- they don\'t approve. Is it possible that it\'s not just -- that along with President Obama, they are frustrated with the pace of economic recovery, but maybe that Americans disagree with what President Obama is doing, disagree with the direction he is taking the country?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have had a vigorous back-and-forth in this country about health care.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'d be the first to admit that we think there are a lot more benefits than people see and feel in these bills.\xc2\xa0 If that\'s a failing, I think that is certainly a failing that I and others here at the White House take responsibility for, up to and including the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if the Senate loses the 60-member filibuster-proof majority, does the President feel that it would be in the best interest of moving health care forward for House Democrats to support the Senate bill and get it on his desk as soon as possible?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 These are going to be all great questions tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ll answer them tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I promise I\'ll be here tomorrow, how about that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we turn to Haiti then, if you would?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 U.S. planes are flying -- are U.S. planes flying over Haiti broadcasting a message to the Haitians that they should not try to come to the United States, that they would be turned away? Can you tell us what that\'s about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of the particular message that you\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 We certainly -- we have seen no preparation for any type of mass migration that some might have been concerned about.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t see any evidence coalescing around that at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'re not aware of any message that the United States government is broadcasting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that there\'s a 2:00 p.m. call, the regular updated calls that we\'ve done on giving you all information from our disaster response teams about the latest on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And our focus obviously is on search and rescue right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Governor Rendell said that the White House was involved in actually getting the plane of the orphanages, taking them out of Haiti, bringing them to Pittsburgh.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what the administration\'s role has been?\xc2\xa0 And just clear up --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\'re working on putting some of that together for me now, but I don\'t have that up to date with me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And do you know if half of those orphans were actually sent to Pittsburgh?\xc2\xa0 There was a number, 53, that they had --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\'re working on some of that, and we\'ll get a better -- a fuller readout of that.\xc2\xa0 They\'re putting that together.\xc2\xa0 Some of the folks that were involved in that are on their way back from Haiti back to Washington today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a 4:00 p.m. meeting with USAID here at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 USAID -- here at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There is a principals committee meeting, not a presidential meeting.\xc2\xa0 And there may be some updates out of that that we would brief you on as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it\'s a meeting not unlike we\'ve had before -- sometimes the President has been in, sometimes he hasn\'t -- coordinating our response and ensuring that if people feel like we need -- if they need more help in doing stuff that that reaches the highest levels and we can make sure that happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the President\'s agenda for his second year in office and what\'s the top priority?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the top priority, obviously, Helen, is to continue to work hard on getting this economy back on track and creating jobs again.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- he outlined some ideas in December on -- some successful programs, some of which were in the Recovery Act, that many people have, in the parlance of oversubscribed in terms of the amount of money that was available but having applications for two or three or four times that amount of money.\xc2\xa0 His primary focus will be on creating jobs.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to talk about a different topic -- the election in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that you don\'t want to discuss -- you don\'t want to discuss why something happens before it happens, but something has already happened, and that is that there has been a groundswell of support for a Republican in the blue state of Massachusetts for a candidate who\'s running against the President\'s agenda.\xc2\xa0 Is this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, now, just -- well, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that was the end of your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there are so many different questions here, but one of the questions is -- the big question that a lot of people are posing now is, is this a sign that the White House has simply lost touch with the American people, that they just don\'t get it? This is not something that\'s happening --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When I read your poll I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come away with that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 When I read the CBS poll and they said 70 percent of the American people thought the President was -- cared about people like them, I came to the conclusion that 70 percent of the people believed that he cared about people like them.\xc2\xa0 So, no, I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good diversion, but I mean this is still happening -- it\'s still happening in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s your poll.\xc2\xa0 I hate to quote CBS to CBS.\xc2\xa0 I should have tried it out on you and used your poll on him and sort of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds to me like you\'re confident that the Republican is going to lose in Massachusetts if you think that poll is reflective of where the American people are right now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Your question was whether the vote would be reflective of the American people.\xc2\xa0 I simply said what I said your poll showed, Chip.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'ll have time --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- question of do you think that this White House has just lost touch with the American people?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think according to any reasonable measure, the answer to that is, of course not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President -- have you heard him express surprise or frustration about how close this race is in Massachusetts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 He was both surprised and frustrated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some details?\xc2\xa0 Anything else?\xc2\xa0 Angry?\xc2\xa0 And at whom?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not pleased.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Frustrated at whom, about what?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get in more of that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Recognizing you don\'t know the results yet, in the interest of preparedness, which I\'m sure the President views as a virtue, have you talked to Speaker Pelosi at all about this so-called plan B of the House passing the Senate bill as is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the President has had an opportunity -- I can check on whether the President has spoken directly with Speaker Pelosi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have any member of staff that you\'re aware of?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume some people here have talked to the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 I do not have a catalog of each and every one of those conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President lay out the stakes when he was in Massachusetts on Sunday and say to those folks --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if you don\'t put Martha Coakley in the United States Senate our health care bill likely dies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- again, let\'s wait for the results.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President believes that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at health care as sort of hanging up by a string here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Health care is a priority for him now.\xc2\xa0 It will be a priority for him tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any particular reason why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that could be a pretty compelling argument to Democrats.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President laid out exactly what was at stake.\xc2\xa0 For the people of Massachusetts, it\'s about electing somebody that will represent their interests in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And are you going to elect somebody who has consistently fought for middle-class, working-class interests, as you heard the President say, or somebody who campaigns as an independent and has voted 96 percent of the time with Republicans in the state Senate?\xc2\xa0 I think he laid it out quite clearly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is his decision not to put it in those terms -- that if you don\'t send Coakley to the Senate my health care bill could fail -- a tacit acknowledgement that that\'s not a very compelling argument for voters right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I don\'t think the President believes and subscribes to that as an overall premise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond talking about -- focus on the economy and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- there\'s a race near Connecticut.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to mention New England at all in this question.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 States that begin with "M" --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is -- but feel free to answer your own question if you -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mississippi is lovely this time of year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some concrete, specific examples of what you\'ll be doing in the coming months to persuade the American people that you are focused on the economy and on jobs, beyond just talking about it in general terms.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I could give you a list of what we\'re going to do -- we\'ll have economic events here later this week, on Thursday here.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll visit Ohio on Friday.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk to the U.S. Conference of Mayors about a jobs-creating agenda here also on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 But the President isn\'t going to get focused on the economy in the coming months; the President obviously has been focused quite clearly on the economy since his first moments in office.</p>\n<p>Last week the President discussed a bank responsibility fee that focuses in on the health of the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President will talk about an agenda for creating jobs, about getting ourselves back on a path toward fiscal responsibility; making college education more affordable and taking the banks out of being the middle men for college loans.\xc2\xa0 A lot of those things the President has talked about and will continue to talk about, and you\'ll see obviously some of that in the State of the Union.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, since you\'ve answered all our questions on the special election, can I ask you if the President is going to take notice in any way tomorrow about the end of his first year in office?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing special, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Press conference?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I don\'t want to be technical about it, but wouldn\'t today actually be the end of his first year?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, noon tomorrow would be the end of it, technically.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there\'s anything that he\'ll do prior to noon that\'s -- I mean, I\'ve got to be honest with you, Mark.\xc2\xa0 I think in many ways it is -- it\'s an anniversary of types, but I don\'t see that a lot of people are ultimately focused on marking the first year.\xc2\xa0 I mean, since we\'ve been here, we\'ve had the anniversary of the election -- that was the first year; and then there was the end of the first year, which was the end of the year; and then there will be the end of the first year, which you appropriately point out will be at or around noon on -- so, I mean, there\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First 100 days.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, first 100 days, first 200 days, first six months -- I mean, there is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s what we do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Much to my chagrin.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, but I don\'t -- there will be no surprise parties for the end of the first year.</p>\n<p><br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President call for a bipartisan commission on the debt in the State of the Union?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has -- in talking about Laura\'s question about the economy -- the President obviously has talked a lot about the need to get our fiscal house in order; shares the concern about where our fiscal situation is, and is exploring many options for, in both the budget and in the State of the Union, that we would talk about our commitment to doing so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And back to health care, why didn\'t the President and Harry Reid work even harder to keep Olympia Snowe on their side back in October and November?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President continues to work hard on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I understand you\'re still gathering information on Governor Rendell and the adoptions.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering does the administration hope that maybe this is a blueprint for future adoptions of Haitian children following this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get a little bit more information before I get -- I mean, look, I think obviously it is a -- I think we have all seen remarkable stories coming out of such a calamitous disaster; our search and rescue teams finding more and more people every day, a record number of people for an earthquake just yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I think as you\'ve heard administration officials on the ground in Haiti say, we will do better today than we did yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We will do better tomorrow than we\'re going to do today.</p>\n<p>We\'re trying as hard as we can in working with the Haitian government and with our international partners to address I think what anybody would term the largest humanitarian effort they\'ve ever seen.\xc2\xa0 Again, what we do today will be bettered by what we do tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we follow on Haiti?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A totally new topic -- any update on where the President is going to donate his Nobel Prize money?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know they continue to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 I think he has not received any money yet.\xc2\xa0 But as soon as they -- as he makes those donations, we will let you guys know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you talked earlier about that during the campaign, you guys were able to tap into the sort of anger and angst in the country, as essentially the outsider fighting on behalf of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I also said that obviously we -- that anger was there and we certainly acknowledge it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is, do you guys feel that what you\'ve -- what\'s now happened to the President and the White House is that you guys are now the recipients of that anger in a way that you maybe didn\'t expect would happen as quickly --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 To go back to Mark\'s question, we haven\'t been here for a year wondering what it is we were here to do.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President was elected to deal with a set of problems, to make the right decision whether or not it was the popular decision.\xc2\xa0 Look, this was the case long before the poll that Jake or the poll that I mentioned to Chip point out.\xc2\xa0 Some of those decisions weren\'t popular ones -- well before we got to what you were talking about, Jake.\xc2\xa0 Ensuring that the banks didn\'t collapse was not a popular decision.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly believes it was the right one.\xc2\xa0 Ensuring that two domestic auto companies didn\'t go out of business -- not popular. Again, the President believed it was the right decision to make.</p>\n<p>He understands -- again, he understands that frustration.\xc2\xa0 He\'s heard it -- in all honesty, he heard it when he ran for the United States Senate beginning in 2003.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t believe that -- certainly there\'s frustration.\xc2\xa0 I think it is with a lot of people in this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said moments ago that you\'d be the first to admit that there are more benefits in the health care bill than many Americans see, and that if that\'s a failing to communicate that, that you and others at the White House, including the President, take responsibility for it.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think, given the many words that have been spoken, the many appearances the President has made around the country on this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\'s over-exposed?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think he\'s been unable --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m baiting you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know; I\'m not taking the bait.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why has he been unable to convince the American people, to fully convince them that this bill is a good idea and the right thing to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think in many -- some of this is drowned out -- there\'s no doubt, as many words as the President has uttered and as many interviews as he\'s done and as many appearances as he\'s had, there\'s no doubt that in some ways it\'s drowned out by arguments that may or may not be central to the focus of the bill.</p>\n<p>But whether we had -- whether health care today was passed or not, the President would be talking about the benefits of that bill even if it was passed.\xc2\xa0 Many of those benefits that he would talk about go into effect immediately -- ensuring that a child that had previously been discriminated against in trying to get health insurance because of a preexisting condition will get wiped away as soon as the President signs health care legislation.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll discuss that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about failings.\xc2\xa0 Was there anything that you would do differently, looking back?\xc2\xa0 Is there something you could have done better to make your case better to the American people so that we wouldn\'t be -- you wouldn\'t be in this situation that you\'re in right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, if we -- I\'m sure that -- Sheryl, I\'ll read this transcript and think there\'s things that I could have done better.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s any -- there\'s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to spend a lot of time, at least now, going through all that.\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say we do not -- nobody believes anybody has pitched a perfect game.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Olympia Snowe.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke to her by phone, I gather, on Friday.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what they talked about?\xc2\xa0 Is she part of a plan --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I don\'t have a readout on whether they talked or not, and I can certainly look at it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that also the subject of the meeting this afternoon, Chris Dodd coming by here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe, if I\'m not mistaken, my guess is I\'m sure they\'ll touch on health care as well as financial reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just can you give us an overall state of what we were talking about last week, the negotiations to try and bring the two houses together, or if that\'s on hold until --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I know the staffs met and discussed a lot of this going through the weekend.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any meetings at this point to announce that the President is in, but I know they continue to work through at a staff level based on hours and hours of meetings of merging these two bills together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not on hold, pending the outcome of the election?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should President Obama take this special election personally?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have said it\'s not a referendum on him, but should he feel, or does he feel, that he bears some responsibility for the vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, let\'s see what the outcome is before --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you say anything about it tonight?\xc2\xa0 Do you imagine a statement or anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume that -- well, the President will call the winner.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have a readout of that call.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I mean, I think the polls closed, what, at 8:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate that the President will have a statement tonight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On financial reform, is the President going to do a little arm-twisting as far as the Consumer Protection Agency, or is he coming around and thinking that maybe that could be a responsibility divided up among --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President\'s viewpoint on this I think is quite clear that we have to have a strong, independent voice on behalf of consumers.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something the President has talked about repeatedly in this process, and something he\'ll emphasize again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect him talk about this with Senator Dodd?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that -- my sense is financial reform writ large will come up.\xc2\xa0 I can get a sense after the meeting whether the consumer part came up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, leading --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to stand up.\xc2\xa0 I can hear from you from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have trouble projecting.\xc2\xa0 So excuse me.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake will help you out.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leading bank economists last week predicted that private sector hiring will increase during the first three months of this year, and they suggested that politicians refrain from spending more tax dollars on job creation until the end of the three-month period.\xc2\xa0 They said, if our projection is wrong, well, then you should spend federal dollars.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if the President, this week when he talks about the economy, will exhibit that kind of patience -- let\'s wait and see -- or is he ready to go full speed ahead and spend more money?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President outlined a series of ideas which I mentioned earlier:\xc2\xa0 increase in funding for clean energy jobs; there\'s obviously been discussions about infrastructure aid.\xc2\xa0 There have been discussions about state and local fiscal relief.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the ideas he outlined in December are no less needed now than at any point.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll continue to push forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Do I hope the private forecasters are correct?\xc2\xa0 I think there are certainly millions of Americans that hope that\'s true. The question, obviously, we will eventually get to is the pacing of that and are there things that can be done to accelerate this process?\xc2\xa0 That will be -- that\'s what the President has asked his team, and that\'s what the President will demand of all of us, including Congress --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t have an answer yet?\xc2\xa0 Because these economists say that if you spend more money now it\'s overkill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I mean, the hole -- the employment hole as we sit here and speak is about 7.5 million since that recession began in December of 2007.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that anybody that -- and, again, that\'s just -- 7.5 million that have lost their jobs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously people that continue -- that are not even in the statistics anymore because they continue to look but they\'ve been looking for more than six months.</p>\n<p>I don\'t think we\'re in danger in this three-month period in filling that hole completely.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we\'ve got to do that and begin to add jobs based on a new foundation that doesn\'t depend on the bubble-and-bust economy that we\'ve relied on for a long, long time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, so broadly speaking, can you talk about the difference between 59 and 60 votes in the Senate and what that means for the President\'s agenda this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Broadly, it\'s one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, can I try another?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So tomorrow, several progressive groups including --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark taught me that.</p>\n<p><br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Technically, it\'s one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- including Code Pink, Greenpeace, are planning a rally outside the White House to protest what they say has been a failure to act or at least deliver on a lot of the change that was promised a year ago.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House\'s message for folks like that who are questioning the lack -- or at least the pace of the action on a lot of those priorities?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I -- this isn\'t directed at -- look, this isn\'t directed as a response to those interest groups or what have you.\xc2\xa0 I guess, going back to Mark\'s question, the President -- I guess the reason that there\'s not a lot of recognition about one year is it\'s certainly -- it\'s a calendar date that denotes you\'ve been here a year, but the President didn\'t outline throughout the campaign, here are the things I\'m going to do the first year, here\'s what I\'m -- here\'s how I\'m going to fill years two and three, and then on year four it will be this volume of -- change takes a long time.\xc2\xa0 Change isn\'t ever easy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he learn?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he learned, Helen, part of what I\'m talking about, which is that change is never easy; that change takes time; that change has to go through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not to say -- I think what Congress has accomplished this year has been enormous.\xc2\xa0 Getting a recovery plan through as quickly as was done to get resources into the economy that we\'ve already seen has helped pull an economy from negative economic growth for four consecutive quarters to the positive -- I think there\'s an awful lot to be proud of in what has been accomplished.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can assure you the President never thought that we\'d wake up at 11:59 a.m. January 20th, 2010, and he would think, wow, I\'ve finished it all and now what am I going to do?\xc2\xa0 We always knew we\'d have plenty to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is it fair to expect that the tenor of the State of the Union address next week will depend greatly on what happens in Massachusetts today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s true, no.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve been working on a series of ideas and proposals -- Helen asked what the most important issue was -- on jobs.\xc2\xa0 The President will -- regardless of what happens in Massachusetts, the President is going to talk about jobs.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to talk about fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about our obligations in Iraq and Afghanistan to address terrorism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I honestly don\'t think that -- they\'re writing the speech right now, so if they\'re going to change it all tomorrow, I hope Favreau hears me and just goes a little early to the gym today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t there a little difference, perhaps, in the body language between boldness and contrition?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President understands that regardless of what happens in Massachusetts, we face a set of circumstances that have to be addressed and have to be dealt with.\xc2\xa0 Whether there are 59 seats in the Senate or 60, we still have to work hard to get our economy back on track.\xc2\xa0 We still have to work hard to make the promise of affordable, accessible health care for millions of Americans a reality.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that there\'s an entirely new agenda behind some door based on the result of tonight.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Voinovich said he thinks that President Obama agrees with him on the need for the bipartisan debt commission but isn\'t sure the politics are there for it.\xc2\xa0 Does that sound right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I know that in the coming days the Senate is going to vote on what Senators Conrad and Gregg have proposed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly one thing that, among others, that we have looked at to get our country back on a path toward fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 What number draft is the speechwriter on for the speech?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jon, if you can hear this, please call.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I honestly don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been working on it for a little while.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say "a little while," so this is not like a first or second draft?\xc2\xa0 This has been ongoing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\'s been -- he\'s been writing for a while.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on the speech, when it comes to Haiti, will the President deal with the issue of Haiti in the speech, and giving and the compassion of the American heart?\xc2\xa0 Is that part of the speech next week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He will undoubtedly mention Haiti.\xc2\xa0 I think what we are all enormously proud of as Americans is the outpouring of support for the suffering that people have seen on their televisions.\xc2\xa0 One of the things -- that\'s one of the reasons he wanted to visit the Red Cross yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think we have -- the spirit of the American people always meets the challenges that it faces, and I think again we can all be proud of that spirit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow on that.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern about some of the organizations that are raising funds, raising food, raising clothes for the relief effort there -- is there a concern in this White House about some of the controversies around some of these organizations right now, as there\'s an immediate need and a long-term need?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t know enough about individual -- all the individual charities.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\'s a set of criteria that people can look at before they give their money on how much is spent on overhead, how much goes to what is needed on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Obviously former President Bush and former President Clinton have helped to set up an organization to deal with both the search and rescue and what is needed to get food and water and resources there now.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll also be there in the months and years to come in what will clearly be a very long-term project of renewal and of rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said the President was angry.\xc2\xa0 With whom is he angry?\xc2\xa0 Could you clarify\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t expand on that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Can you now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you might tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\'s always hope.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Audacious.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- should have Mark annotate the transcripts -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve emphasized the President\'s concern about the unemployment numbers and about the deficit.\xc2\xa0 In dealing with one, do you exacerbate the other?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the President understands that -- for instance, the recovery plan was split up to basically cover two fiscal years because nobody believed that we would have turned this completely around, given the depths of the recession that we were in, immediately or only after a year. So I think the President is understanding of whatever -- what tension may be there in dealing with the medium- and long-term fiscal challenges that we face.</p>\n<p>But, absolutely -- if you necessarily pull back completely, you\'re not -- you\'ve got a gas-and-break going that isn\'t going to necessarily help where the economy is.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 News conference tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Be here around 10:00 a.m. -- if we\'re not here, start without us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:23 P.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
