b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:32 P.M. EDT<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry for the delay.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Take us away.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction to Iran saying earlier today that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to release one of the American hikers this weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are -- the State Department, I believe, is working to actively confirm with the Swiss government the veracity of those reports.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI would point out that, as we have said throughout this process, that these are three innocent children, innocent kids, who committed no crime, all three of whom should be released and released immediately by the Iranian government.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could switch to next week just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 This week the President had two speeches on the economy.\xc2\xa0 There is a news conference tomorrow where the economy is probably going to be a large part of that.\xc2\xa0 Is the economy theme going to continue -- is the President going to continue the economy -- talking about the economy next week also?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has spent more time on any -- more time on the economy than on any issue since he\xe2\x80\x99s been here, and I expect that that will continue next week.\xc2\xa0 I expect that will be the focus of his opening remarks at tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s press conference and throughout next week as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, will the White House reach out directly to Terry Jones and request that the Koran burning not take place?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there are discussions inside of the government about the possibility of doing that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that a final decision has been reached on that.\xc2\xa0 If anything does happen, we will certainly keep you up to date and up to speed on who might be called -- who might call and what was said.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kinds of things would be discussed in making that decision?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen General Petraeus, General Odierno, the Secretary of State and the President all say, this puts the lives of our troops in direct danger.\xc2\xa0 This is a recruiting bonanza for al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And this goes against every one of our values, as the President discussed yesterday, for -- certainly for those three reasons alone.\xc2\xa0 This is a monumentally terrible idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say, judging from the publicity that this individual is attracting, I doubt it is hard for him to have missed the commander in Afghanistan, the former commander in Iraq, and the Commander-in-Chief all discussing the potential impacts of troops that we have deployed throughout the world that are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way protecting the very religious freedoms that we all enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as the President said yesterday, I think there is no doubt that this is -- this should and could be seen as nothing more -- nothing less than a big recruiting bonanza for al Qaeda. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is one of the options a call from the President himself?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not necessarily heard that discussed.\xc2\xa0 I think -- but, again, there are discussions inside the government about what might happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s role now?\xc2\xa0 Has the President or anyone else in the administration asked the FBI to go -- any kind of special security precautions tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have seen reports that the FBI has either met with -- I know there are a series of local ordinances that govern burnings in and around this area of Gainesville.\xc2\xa0 I do not know of any special instructions and I would point you over to the FBI. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t this a hate crime?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- let me be careful not to label something that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is there anything legally -- <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Let me say this.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this is, as you have heard each and every one of -- of folks in this government say, this is a hateful act.\xc2\xa0 This is an offensive act.\xc2\xa0 The burning of a religious book is something that I think a great many people -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reaction -- the interfaith reaction has been overwhelming on this.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- I think people of all religions understand the hatefulness of what could transpire. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But so is the government response, a worldwide bulletin to travelers to be careful as they travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this is -- look, we understand -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what happens when the potential for something like this happens.\xc2\xa0 It is smart for the State Department to caution those that are traveling overseas, and we certainly continue to take all the necessary precautions to ensure that Americans that are overseas, and as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard General Petraeus and General Odierno say, take precautions that we need to protect our troops.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talk about a lot of local ordinances that are being looked at, but is there anything on the federal level legally that\xe2\x80\x99s being looked at that could potentially block this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, let me point you over to FBI because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 And my understanding of the local ordinances is mostly through reading. It\xe2\x80\x99s not through a briefing or anything like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House is seen as -- one of its achievements -- changing the tone of how the Muslim world views the U.S. in the wake of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 Do you see something like this as a potential setback to the gains that have been made?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt -- and I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think there are many -- there are very few issues that we have seen unite across a political spectrum in the past couple of years.\xc2\xa0 This is certainly one of them.\xc2\xa0 There have -- Democrat and Republican have spoken out against this.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this has the potential to set back our ability to keep our soldiers safe, our abilities to keep our country safe, set back efforts to demonstrate that we are, as both this President and the former President have said, we are not at war with a religion.\xc2\xa0 We are at war with those who have perverted the values and the beliefs of that religion and who, I would point out, have killed more of their own religion than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the speech yesterday, President Obama mentioned John Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s name I believe eight times.\xc2\xa0 Why did he think it was so important when our CNN polling shows that 55 percent of Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t even familiar with him? Why was it so important to hammer away at his name yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Congressman Boehner represents, as the President laid out yesterday, a series of economic ideas that are rooted in the ideas that got us into this mess in the first place.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThe campaign committee chairman for both the congressional campaign and the Senate campaign went on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d and said, we want to return to George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s ideas; we want to return to the ideas of those eight years that got us into this mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we were in Cleveland, the same place that Congressman Boehner was in where he outlined a return to the past, and the President wanted to outline what he believes a hopeful and vibrant American future looks like.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what was the strategy, though, behind hammering away at his name so many times? You guys don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything by accident, so clearly that many times, you were trying to make a point here about John Boehner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think taking the lack of new ideas and giving them a little lift is something that I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President do very often.\xc2\xa0 Look at Congressman Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s interview on \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The first thing he said is we have to cut spending. And the second thing he said was we should spend $700 billion extending tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of our country.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, how that makes any sense is something that we will certainly let John Boehner explain.\xc2\xa0 And if it helps to use his name so that he gets a chance to explain that, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will continue to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many times did I?\xc2\xa0 I only used it once -- no, a couple times.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, a couple times.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the pastor in Florida, the discussions -- is the President personally involved in those discussions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think they have largely been held from the National Security Adviser -- with the National Security Adviser inside this building.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And have you heard the President talk about this?\xc2\xa0 Can you relate specifically that he said other than -- other than in interviews?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What he said yesterday is what we have heard in here.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s said anything that I can recall that\xe2\x80\x99s different than what he said in that interview yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any discussion of who the likely person would be in the administration to talk to this man?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, there are some of those discussions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- when we have something more concrete about that we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll read it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a little more philosophical level, have there been discussions or -- does there come a point, even in a nation of laws, where when you have this kind of danger and you can\xe2\x80\x99t pin any particular law on it other than public burning, does there come a point where you just say the danger is so great?\xc2\xa0 For example, there are people now being held in indefinite detention -- a lot of people think there\xe2\x80\x99s simply no legal grounds for doing that, but the determination has been made that they\xe2\x80\x99re so dangerous you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep them there.\xc2\xa0 Does there come a point where this man presents such a danger that you take him into custody or you do something without pinning it on a particular law and you say it\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I would direct you to the FBI.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard a discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any discussions like that in the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard a discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is talking about taking him into custody or anything like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Again, I -- as I said earlier to a question about the FBI, I would talk to the FBI.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you worried about giving this man and his flock more attention than they deserve? (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the looking glass here?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t own a television network, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the fact that the man has more people at his press conference than he does in his pews on a Sunday service -- (laughter) -- I think is an illuminating thing.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s passing the collection around for -- (laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say this.\xc2\xa0 Look, that was sort of a softball, and I think I put that kind of deep in the left field seats.\xc2\xa0 But, Wendell, look, you have somebody who has -- there are more people in here than go to his church right now.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say this -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to single anybody out, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- but parking a TV camera in front of a banner on the side of a truck and giving lift to something like that -- I think there comes a point when you have to wonder what is the utility of this.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have heard from our commander in Afghanistan that this puts our troops in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 This is a desperate man seeking the attention of the better part of the world.\xc2\xa0 I think we would all be served, for the safety of ourselves and for those that protect us each day, to cover something besides him every hour on the hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who are you blaming there -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Him or the media?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My simple point on this, Chip, is the question -- the utility of parking a television camera in front of that banner for every hour on the hour -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some utility in asking ourselves the question of whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to go about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s doing this to boost church attendance?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you said it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, seriously, do you think this was -- do you think this was initially done to bring --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve only got 30, I would guess that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take much.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear, you are pinning a portion of the blame on the media here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no. I just -- to be fair, I was asked a question.\xc2\xa0 I think it is relevant that there are, as I said, more people at his press conferences than listen to his sermons.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Minority Leader, do you think you can make the midterms a referendum on him in much the same way the Republicans would like to make the elections a referendum on the President?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, I think the midterms will, as the President talked about, be a -- I think any election is about a choice.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President laid out yesterday the choice that he sees, and that is:\xc2\xa0 Are we going to go back to the type of ideas and the type of policies and the type of actions that led us into this mess, or are we going to take steps to continue to strengthen and grow our economy and add jobs?\xc2\xa0 I think the President is certainly comfortable with that as a choice that he thinks more and more Americans will look at as they make decisions heading into November.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is about one person.\xc2\xa0 I think, though, that the one person in Congressman Boehner that we talked about yesterday, embodies every bit of an economic vision that says that the free market is in total control, that we should spend money we don\xe2\x80\x99t have, that we should reward the wealthiest among us with tax breaks, and we should tell those in the middle class that you\xe2\x80\x99re on your own.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s been the economic philosophy that we saw throughout a majority of the past eight years.\xc2\xa0 And I think he embodies that to continue. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that Mr. Boehner hadn\xe2\x80\x99t offered any proposals, any economic proposals.\xc2\xa0 The congressman says he has proposed rolling back the spending budget to 2008 levels and freezing all tax rates.\xc2\xa0 Is that a practical proposal?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 Freezing our tax rates for the wealthiest among us -- for those that make $250,000 a year -- costs $700 billion, okay?\xc2\xa0 He has certainly not proposed $700 billion in spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t be for cutting taxes on small business, but when there\xe2\x80\x99s a bill in front of you to cut taxes on small business you vote against it.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t be for cutting spending and then adding $700 billion to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the more and more people get a sense of the type of ideas that John Boehner and his colleagues are offering, that choice is one the President is more and more --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another matter, finally.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an Iranian opposition group that claims the country is building a nuclear site about 80 miles west of Tehran.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. aware of this? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say, Wendell, obviously we are -- we take the Iranian nuclear program, as you know, extremely seriously.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve instituted sanctions, and our Asian allies have added to the sanctions that have been introduced and passed in this country and at a U.N. level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not going to get into, though, discussing intelligence matters.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are -- we continue to monitor the situation very closely.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we are aware of it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into discussing sensitive intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the pastor, is there -- have you reached out to former President Bush or anybody from the previous administration to possibly be involved in any conversations with this guy?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.\xc2\xa0 But I can --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that is among the discussions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, but let me -- it\xe2\x80\x99s something I can check on.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President this morning in the interview with ABC, he specifically would not draw a veto line in the sand -- and he has done that before, he has made veto threats before.\xc2\xa0 He did not make a veto threat on this.\xc2\xa0 Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get to that, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find ourselves needing to veto it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the decision on the tax rates?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think legislation is going to come to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk that he would need to veto.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In August of 2009, the President answered somebody\xe2\x80\x99s question -- a question about raising taxes in the middle of a recession.\xc2\xa0 And the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing you want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a recession because that would just suck up, take more demand out of the economy and put businesses in a further hole.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I know we\xe2\x80\x99re technically not in a recession.\xc2\xa0 But does the --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we would argue that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just going to say, do you argue are we in a recession or not?\xc2\xa0 One.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let a group of economists with nice degrees on their wall discuss when it began, when it ended, when it changed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you act as if it\xe2\x80\x99s a recession because America feels like it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, Chuck, I use the -- I talked about this a little bit the other day.\xc2\xa0 There is not anybody in this country -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear -- that takes home half a million dollars a year that is delaying their purchasing decisions, okay? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe consumer demand is not impeded by the millionaire that can\xe2\x80\x99t make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case for 10 years.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case in the late \xe2\x80\x9890s.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in this case, he is okay with raising some tax rates in the middle of what feels like a recession?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because what you\xe2\x80\x99re -- the example that he discussed and the example that you discussed doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pertain to those individuals.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a millionaire who is saying, you know I was going to buy a big -- the NFL season starts, I was going to buy a nice, new 48-inch color TV, but I just -- I only make a million dollars a year.\xc2\xa0 Those people don\xe2\x80\x99t -- if those people are out there, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody that I know has met them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there are families that -- of four that make $40,000 a year that are trying to figure out how to pay their power bill, how to send their kid to college, how to make ends meet, how to make their mortgage payment, and they\xe2\x80\x99re having to make some tough decisions.\xc2\xa0 And the President strongly believes that the tax cuts for those in the middle class should be, as you said yesterday, permanently extended.\xc2\xa0 But the notion that somehow consumer demand is being driven down by millionaires that somehow can\xe2\x80\x99t find enough money to buy and purchase goods, that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s important, Chuck, is that we are having to make -- everyone is having to make decisions about -- and take into account our fiscal situation.\xc2\xa0 And it does not make any sense to add $700 billion to that already growing debt and deficit by extending tax cuts for those that -- whose activity is not going to change consumer demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a line in the sand, or is this part of a negotiation?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you -- you know, since you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a veto threat --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Chuck --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, so --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves -- I do not envision -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to veto something that you don\xe2\x80\x99t think is ever going to reach your desk at a point in which you\xe2\x80\x99d need to veto.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think some sort of compromise or a temporary extension of even highest tax rate -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that might not reach his desk -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to reach his desk?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think -- no, because the President believes that we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we simply cannot afford tax cuts for those that didn\xe2\x80\x99t need them, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t asking for them, and that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just expect this to die in the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a -- I think a majority of those in Congress believe that we should, as the President does, extend tax cuts for the middle class, and let the tax cuts for the wealthiest among us -- let the tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford expiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe President used the example yesterday of Warren Buffett.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s Warren Buffett going to do with his tax cut?\xc2\xa0 Going to go buy a bunch of color TVs?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Going to buy another house?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this idea of any temporary -- I mean, this idea, because it could be a one-year extension, too, that\xe2\x80\x99s just off the table, or you just don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s coming?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can afford it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- as the President said yesterday, a two-year extension of this tax cut would cost nearly $100 billion.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any economist that would tell you that the best way that the government could spend $100 billion to get this economy moving again is to give it to a millionaire.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not negotiating.\xc2\xa0 You guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- because it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take the $100 billion and spend it here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you said to the President, are there better ways to take and use that money? Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 There are many economists that would tell you there are far better ways to use that money.\xc2\xa0 One of the best ways not to use that money is not to spend seven times that amount of money on the tax cut for the rich.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the New Zealand earthquakes, do you know if President Obama has telephoned or will telephone the New Zealand Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0 And does the U.S. have anything to learn from the way New Zealand handled this quake and the hundred aftershocks?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me find out from NSC if the President -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall seeing that call, but let me check and get a better answer to the -- <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he has the intention of calling him?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me find that out.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are you saying that the government needs the $700 billion more than the people who earned it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we cannot afford $700 billion in tax cuts for millionaires, yes, or billionaires, or multibillionaires, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t -- you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t normally -- I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say you can\xe2\x80\x99t, because that would -- you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t normally with a straight face go on television and bemoan the sheer amount of spending and then not even pause to breathe before blowing through another $700 billion in tax cuts that, again, the preponderance of them go to millionaires.\xc2\xa0 A millionaire would get a $100,000 tax break.\xc2\xa0 We are not a $100,000 tax break from a millionaire away from being in an economic position that strengthens us.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just not.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you hear -- then the next argument is, well, what about small business?\xc2\xa0 Well, what about small business?\xc2\xa0 What happened when there was a bill to cut the taxes on small business, to cut the amount of money that people can expense based on their investment or zero capital gains invested into small business?\xc2\xa0 What happened?\xc2\xa0 They voted against that.\xc2\xa0 Yet their defense is, what about small business?\xc2\xa0 Well, if you cared about small business, there was a bill to do that.\xc2\xa0 It cut their taxes, right?\xc2\xa0 If you care about spending, we can\xe2\x80\x99t borrow $700 billion for tax cuts we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford. That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to borrow that money.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you have it?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s $700 billion that is revenue you won\xe2\x80\x99t get to spend if the tax cut is extended.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you have to pay on the debt?\xc2\xa0 Do you have to -- <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The answer to that is yes.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the government can cut spending on its end.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the President does not believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s in any way a good use of that revenue.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President met with Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Does that indicate that he is getting closer now to picking a nominee for the consumer agency --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has options to look through and is going through those options, and I anticipate will make an announcement.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate an announcement in the next couple days, but probably in the not-too-distant future.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say -- was he talking with her about heading the agency or helping the administration set up the machinery for the agency?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we have said on a number of occasions that Elizabeth Warren would be a highly qualified candidate to join this administration to help implement financial reform as it relates to the consumer bureau, and that the President and the team are interested in talking to her about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Michael Barr still under consideration?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Michael is also among those that the administration is looking at.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many others are there?\xc2\xa0 About?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- maybe one or two more, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact count or number.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning the President on \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to practically endorse the chief of staff should he decide to run for mayor of Chicago. Obviously the President is really popular in Chicago but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he risk some sort of backlash from voters who might think that he is sort of telling them who to vote for --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I talked a little bit about this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The President said this yesterday and I would reiterate it; David Axelrod said it and I\xe2\x80\x99d reiterate that too.\xc2\xa0 I think he believes that Rahm has the qualities that you need to be a successful mayor.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s his viewpoint.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the viewpoint of people that know Rahm.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President was also pretty clear in that we are focused on a number of tasks at hand.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of things that we have to get done over the course of the next many weeks.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of the chief of staff and the focus of the staff here.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Focus of the chief of staff -- that means you guys are fully anticipating he is here through November.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m busy dealing with you guys.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not involved in some of these discussions.\xc2\xa0 Chuck, as I said yesterday, I anticipate that he will take some time to make up his mind about what he wants to do in the future, which he can and should do.\xc2\xa0 But I also said this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 When Mayor Daley stepped down -- we begin -- senior staff here begins and ends their day in Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 Many of you have seen this -- there is a little yellow pad and it\xe2\x80\x99s got all these little things on it, and we go one by one through all these little things.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how our day ended that day.\xc2\xa0 Our day began the next day with that same little yellow pad and all those little things on it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of what Rahm Emanuel is doing here.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can we go back to Pastor Jones?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how did the President and the White House first learn of this?\xc2\xa0 Was it from General Petraeus?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t obviously know the answer to that -- whether that was something that we had seen in the newspapers before that or not.\xc2\xa0 Let me go back and try to find that answer somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President said on \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America\xe2\x80\x9d that what Pastor Jones was planning was not representative of America.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it actually very American, the whole idea of freedom of speech?\xc2\xa0 And how -- are you guys worried at all about how you balance the --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, whether or not the -- the President was obviously not talking about -- look, there are certain principles in the Constitution that we know are enshrined and protected.\xc2\xa0 That does not mean that one should do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think General Petraeus, General Odierno and the President have all enumerated quite clearly why that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the case -- the harm that it could cause our men and women, the harm that it could cause our ability to protect our own country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was speaking of -- about in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more.\xc2\xa0 Given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past month on the mosque in New York and now this Koran burning, is there any discussion within the White House that maybe this might be a time for President Obama to do a national sort of dialogue on Islam in America and America\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Islam?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m -- not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President spoke about why -- the interest that we had in improving our relationship with the Muslim world last year.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the President and members of the national security team are constantly thinking about that in decisions that we make on a whole range of subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I just want to make sure I understand what you just said to Chuck.\xc2\xa0 First of all, my understanding this morning was that the President was saying that Rahm wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- his understanding was that the President -- or that Rahm would not be making a decision about running for -- yes, right, too many characters in this, let me start over -- that Rahm would not make a decision until after the midterms.\xc2\xa0 Is that not how you heard what he said this morning?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not parsing what the President said.\xc2\xa0 I simply reiterated to Chuck that that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that Rahm is going to go through.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t weighing in on the timing or the decision itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounded like Rahm had told the President he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make this decision until after the midterms.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have that --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, but I can --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, if -- regardless if he runs for mayor of Chicago, would the President get involved?\xc2\xa0 Would he endorse?\xc2\xa0 Would he be -- this is sort of a special circumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Christi, I would say this.\xc2\xa0 Hard to make that judgment, not knowing who the candidates are.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xc2\xa0 One wants to burn the copies of Koran.\xc2\xa0 Another one wants to burn the American flags.\xc2\xa0 And this man in New York, he wants to build a mosque where thousands of innocent people died, of all the faiths.\xc2\xa0 As far as Florida is concerned, do you see any new legislation that in the future, something like what happened, that like you mentioned, that no religious books should be burned?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if a legislative effort on that behalf -- that probably is a better question for Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 But, again, all I know is that we understand the impact of what this -- we understand the impact of this. We understand what this means for those in this country and those that are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, that -- and because of that and because of its affront to what we believe, this is a hateful act that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard many in this administration -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to say -- that this should not happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to bring -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- to bring harmony, as the mosque in New York is concerned, more than 80 percent of Americans are against.\xc2\xa0 And don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that the President should make some statement that there should be a kind of interfaith center where all the faiths -- people who died, and not just one faith -- many faiths, people died there -- there should be an interfaith center where everyone --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think as it -- let me take this back to the discussion that we were having earlier, and I mentioned this earlier, that the outpouring of condemnation at this act in Florida by those of all faiths is -- I think is an important thing for that pastor to take into account before he does anything this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, if I may, a different topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me move on here.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to Senate Republicans during the recess about the small business jobs bill?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can check and see if the President has made any calls.\xc2\xa0 I know obviously the last time that the bipartisan leadership was here, it was quite a topic of discussion in needing to and in believing that we had to move this legislation -- this important legislation -- forward.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has made any calls since then. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on Pastor Jones, you said that the State Department has come out with travel advisories in other nations -- to other nations.\xc2\xa0 But has anyone in this administration, including the State Department, reached out in a diplomatic way to try to quell the concerns by the Muslim nations as the potential for this incident Saturday could happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what exact steps the State Department has taken as it relates to that.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to them.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think the -- I hope that the entire world understands that there are those of all faiths, of all political beliefs that strongly condemn the idea of what this individual is trying to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that that is a message that comes through much louder and much more clearly than the potential -- the potentially destructive impact that this act could have. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So has POTUS expressed concerns about making any calls or anything?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of particular calls that he has made into Muslim nations.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask you another question on this.\xc2\xa0 Is this a challenge between freedoms and common sense?\xc2\xa0 And do you think if indeed this does happen and there are pictures of this, it could, as you said, spur -- or be a rallying cry -- for the Taliban and al Qaeda, but what about homegrown terrorists?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a threat too with that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt, because -- look, we know that there are those overseas that are trying to recruit those that are here.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- as the President has said and others, this is a recruiting bonanza.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly one of the specific reasons that this administration, our generals in Iraq and Afghanistan have cited repeatedly as a reason that this not go forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the challenge of freedoms and just common sense -- is it a challenge between freedoms and common sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all aware of the freedoms that we enjoy in this country.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is anybody\xe2\x80\x99s sincere hope -- again, this is a belief shared across the political spectrum, across religious perspective -- and that is that the harm that this will do, the danger that this puts -- the danger with which this puts our men and women in uniform is one that I and everybody in this administration genuinely hopes that this pastor takes into account before he moves forward with his actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you get back to us on her question?\xc2\xa0 I think you said whether the President has called leaders of any Muslim nations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I am not aware of any that he has.\xc2\xa0 I will double-check, but I think the calls that he\xe2\x80\x99s made in the last few days to foreign leaders have largely been around --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anticipation of calls possibly?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.\xc2\xa0 Largely been around Middle East.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anyone respond to the Indonesian President\xe2\x80\x99s appeal?\xc2\xa0 Someone else in government? <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I think that his appeal is a viewpoint shared by those in the administration that have already let the world know where they stand. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about reaching out to the pastor, why not reach out to these Muslim nations if the threat is so significant?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think that the world has heard what these generals have said and what the Commander-in-Chief has said over the past several days on this.\xc2\xa0 I think that there are those throughout the world that understand where the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans are on this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of reports that the Senate might forego a floor vote on the defense authorization bill before the midterms.\xc2\xa0 Where does funding the troops in Afghanistan and Iraq stand on the President\xe2\x80\x99s list of priorities heading into the midterms?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with Legislative Affairs on the notion that there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a vote on the defense authorization.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. Obviously funding our troops is tremendously important to this President. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- the White House wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prefer to see a debate on taxes versus a debate on funding the troops heading into the midterms?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I should check on the original premise of your question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously -- I think I answered that second part of the question.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if they could do one or the other, have a tax debate or a funding debate?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, Congress is going to be here longer than 15 minutes. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot -- judges, appointments, small business bill -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that can get done over the couple of weeks --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0 Do you really think the Senate is going to get all that done in a month?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am, by nature, a tremendously optimistic and hopeful person.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since when?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Since at least four minutes ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- really good vacation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think in general philosophical terms about what many see as a rise of anti-Islam sentiments in the United States, especially people overseas?\xc2\xa0 And was he surprised how this debate over the mosque or what the pastor said escalated so quickly?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look -- I want to separate the two issues because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it makes a lot of sense to combine -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it makes a lot of sense to combine those two issues.\xc2\xa0 So let me speak about these very separately.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it relates to the issue in Florida, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here countless times, that -- we understand the dangers of what these actions could bring.\xc2\xa0 And we have in this country -- this country was founded on the notion of religious freedom.\xc2\xa0 And the offensive nature of taking the religious text of -- somebody\xe2\x80\x99s religious text and burning it is among, I would assume, one of -- among the most destructive things that somebody could do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is not in line with our values.\xc2\xa0 That is not in line with who we are as a people.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a viewpoint, quite honestly, that is shared by, as I said, the vast, vast, vast majority of people.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nLook, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about the mosque and understand that the anniversary of 9/11 that we\xe2\x80\x99ll celebrate on Saturday is one that is -- although nine years past, still and will always be very raw in people\xe2\x80\x99s memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded by a viewpoint that is shared by this administration and the last administration, and that is that those that we are at war with, those that we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting, are not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting with those -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not fighting with a religion.\xc2\xa0 We are fighting with those that have taken and perverted through their extremist beliefs the religious views of many that have more than any other religion killed their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s an important lesson for all the world to know and to understand.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue and this administration will continue to work to improve our relationship with those all over the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he surprised to see, by the nature of this debate, how acrimonious it became?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How what?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How sharp it became, how it escalated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that -- and I think you heard the President say this yesterday, that there is -- the offensive nature of what is being proposed in Florida, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that that has gotten -- that that has engendered quite a lot of response in this country. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the White House just issued a statement about Eid celebration.\xc2\xa0 Will the President do also a video message?\xc2\xa0 And will he talk about --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me check on the video.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s done a video on that or not.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in the colloquies about the Bush tax cuts, you referred to Warren Buffett and millionaires not necessarily needing the money.\xc2\xa0 Could you shed some light as to how the $250,000 cutoff point came to be, when of course there are a number of couples who would earn $250,000, depending on where they live, who don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily consider themselves rich?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but at the same time, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d separate -- I\xe2\x80\x99d separate whether it\xe2\x80\x99s $250,000 or $500,000 from a family of four that makes $55,000, that -- I think for an individual it\xe2\x80\x99s $200,000.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a nice sum of money.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty -- you\xe2\x80\x99re making a pretty good living at $200,000 a piece.\xc2\xa0 I think even -- again, it is hard -- it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of hard to picture somebody clearing $200,000, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s having trouble paying the light bill, unless you live in a house that has maybe too many lights.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And conversely, if all of the tax cuts were to expire, all of them were to expire, CBO estimates that this current deficit -- this year\xe2\x80\x99s current deficit would be cut in half by fiscal 2012.\xc2\xa0 Why not --<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because I do believe that the President -- well, I know the President believes that taking that family of four that makes $50,000 or $55,000 a year, taking that tax cut away, that\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of thousand dollars out of their pocket at a time in which -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, they have been struggling for a long time. This is -- look, I get that some on Wall Street got a little banged up in September of 2008 when the financial crisis hit.\xc2\xa0 But a lot of those guys, even in the current environment, have done quite well.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at -- you heard the President talk about this yesterday -- job creation and income generation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just fallen or stagnated since September of 2008, it\xe2\x80\x99s been in that direction for eight or 10 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why when we say we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into this mess overnight, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 So, again, look, you could, as you mentioned, wipe away a significant portion of that deficit by letting everything expire.\xc2\xa0 The President, though, believes that those tax cuts for the middle class are important particularly at a time in which we are faced with such economic uncertainty in the middle class.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to help us with our curtain raisers, can you talk a little bit about the decision-making that went into the timing of this press conference tomorrow, how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been in the works and why now?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We announced it last week, so -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think.\xc2\xa0 We probably had this discussion a week or so ago.\xc2\xa0 We missed you guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) All right, sorry, that shocked me, too.\xc2\xa0 No, look --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why now specifically?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s as good a time as any for the President to talk about the economy, talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in the upcoming election, just as he did yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, the President will have an opening statement and then answer questions I presume on a whole host of topics like we do in here each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, guys. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any interviews between now and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s press conference?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Pardon me?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any interviews set up between now and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s press conference?<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He did two this morning, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 We understand there\xe2\x80\x99s some tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, he taped an interview today for tomorrow, and then did an interview, which I think will become public later today.\xc2\xa0 La Opinion later today, and Tom Joyner Show today -- this afternoon, early this afternoon for tomorrow morning.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long is the press conference, Robert?\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Five, six hours.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nEND<br/>\n2:22 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
