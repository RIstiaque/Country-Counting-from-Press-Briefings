Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p3">12:30 P.M. EST</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House briefing room.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I wanted to note that President Obama today will host students, parents and teachers at the first-ever White House Student Film Festival, an event that will highlight the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to bring America\xe2\x80\x99s classrooms into the 21st century, with high-speed Internet and cutting-edge technology. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In keeping with his pledge to make 2014 a year of action, using the power of his pen and his phone, the President will announce $400 million in new private sector commitments from Adobe and Prezi to make free software available to teachers and students to help introduce creative learning materials to classrooms all across the country.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Adobe is making available over $300 million worth of free software to teachers and students, including Photoshop and Premiere Elements for creative projects; Presenter and Captivate to amplify e-learning; EchoSign for school workflow; and a range of teacher training resources. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Prezi, a software tool for creating memorable presentations, is providing $100 million in EDU Pro licenses for high schools and all educators across America.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These commitments build on the $750 million in commitments the President announced earlier this month.\xc2\xa0 By using the power of his phone, the President inspired private sector leaders to pledge well over $1 billion in value to America\xe2\x80\x99s students through these private sector commitments in the last month alone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at this cumulatively to get a sense of what this President can do using his authority and his office to bring together outside groups and businesses on behalf of an agenda that expands opportunity and, in this case, enhances the education of American children across the country.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I go to the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Darlene.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 On Ukraine, Secretary Kerry said today that the U.S. is watching to see if Russian activity in Crimea might be \xe2\x80\x9ccrossing a line in any way,\xe2\x80\x9d but that the administration would also be very careful in making judgments about that.\xc2\xa0 Can you say what the U.S. is prepared to do if Russia does cross that line?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we are watching to see, as the Secretary said, whether or not Russia is doing anything that might be crossing the line in any way.\xc2\xa0 We strongly support Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and we expect other nations to do the same.\xc2\xa0 Reports of Russian intervention in Crimea are of deep concern to the United States, and as Secretary Kerry said and Ambassador Rice has said, intervention would be a grave mistake.</p>\n<p class="p4">These reports are also inconsistent with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s previous statements to the United States that Russia will respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and they are inconsistent with the obligation Russia reaffirmed in the Budapest Memorandum.\xc2\xa0 We call on Russia to respect its international obligations made under the U.N. Charter to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\xc2\xa0 We urge all parties to avoid steps that could be misinterpreted or lead to a miscalculation at this delicate time.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would the line be military intervention or some type of use of force over there?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the United States supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the sovereignty of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear to Russia that we believe it would be a grave mistake to intervene in any way.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously had and will continue to have direct communications with Russian government officials.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with President Putin about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry had another conversation with Foreign Minister Lavrov earlier today about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we are conveying very clearly our views, views shared by our European partners and allies, that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity must be respected.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems as though the situation there may be headed to a place where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get worse before it gets better.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what is the level of concern here that the situation there will get worse before it gets better?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are concerned about the situation in Ukraine at several levels.\xc2\xa0 We commend the parliament for the actions that it has taken to install a government and to get to work addressing the serious economic situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We are going to work with our partners and allies and multilateral organizations to look at ways that we can be of assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear in our conversations, including the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s recent conversation with the new Prime Minister of Ukraine, both our commitment to assist Ukraine, but also our expectation that Ukraine, as it tries to fulfill the aspirations of its people, that the Ukrainian government take steps to ensure that the rights of all citizens are respected, and that, as planned, early elections take place.</p>\n<p class="p4">So we are engaging not just with other partners and allies in the region, not just with the Russian government, but with Ukraine and with Ukrainian leaders themselves on all the issues that confront that country at this time.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that it\xe2\x80\x99s a fluid situation, and some of the reports that I mentioned are of concern.\xc2\xa0 And it would be a grave mistake to intervene and to in any way violate the territorial integrity of a sovereign state like Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Mark.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw the reports and the photographs today of men in uniform patrolling airports in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States know who these soldiers are?\xc2\xa0 Are they Russians?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to what I just said about the reports of Russian intervention.\xc2\xa0 Other reports about things and developments in Ukraine are matters that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking into, that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking clarification on, we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing with Ukrainian leaders as well as Russian leaders and others.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t go through with you each report and what the bottom-line truth behind each report is.</p>\n<p class="p4">What I can tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about reports or suggestions that there might be intervention by an outside state, and we have conveyed that.\xc2\xa0 And we would point to assurances by the Russian government that they respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So this is something that we are engaging with at the highest levels across the region.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you talk about those assurances of respecting Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, when the President spoke directly with Putin a week ago, did the Russian President give assurances that he would respect Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At the time of that conversation, as we read out, the President and Russian President Putin agreed that there needed to be a de-escalation of violence in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to the more detailed readout that we gave.</p>\n<p class="p4">As a general matter, in the communications that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with Russian government officials, including Secretary Kerry with Foreign Minister Lavrov, this has been one of the topics of conversation.\xc2\xa0 And we have conveyed our concern about the need to maintain Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, and have received assurances.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a further characterization of those conversations.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a domestic issue -- the EPA made an announcement today about protecting a large fishery in Alaska.\xc2\xa0 Is that the harbinger of a number of examples of the President using his pen and the phone to do environmental protection measures, possibly with an eye to climate change issues?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Bristol Bay assessment\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions about the significant impacts mining activities would have on the area\xe2\x80\x99s unique environment -- its unparalleled sockeye salmon fishery and Native American cultures -- the EPA made a decision to take this step to protect this valuable resource.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House strongly supports that decision by the EPA.\xc2\xa0 The step is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment in the State of the Union to protect pristine American places for future generations.\xc2\xa0 But I would point you to the EPA for more questions about the step that it\xe2\x80\x99s taking today on this matter.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were just talking about expressions of these concerns that you have for potential Russian involvement in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 What options does the United States have available should we reach that point?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate for you, Jim.\xc2\xa0 What I would tell you is that this is a matter that we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on -- the President, Secretary of State, Ambassador Rice and others, Secretary Hagel.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaging with Ukrainian leaders, with Russian leaders and with others in the region to ensure that Ukraine is able to move forward in keeping with the aspirations of its people, that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity is respected, that its sovereignty is respected by other nations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what we might do if something might happen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on the kinds of communications we\xe2\x80\x99re having right now, and focus on the international effort to assist Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as you know, Yanukovych has accused the United States of meddling in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, even as the U.S. is saying to Russia, don\'t meddle in what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a response to what Mr. Yanukovych is saying?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that we have made clear that Mr. Yanukovych lost legitimacy as the leader of Ukraine and abdicated his responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 Not long after signing an agreement with the opposition, he fled the capital of the country in an orderly fashion, packed his belongings and left.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that the Ukrainian parliament acting responsibly to fill that vacuum elected a new government after Mr. Yanukovych fled the scene.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also worth remembering that security forces under Mr. Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s control used snipers in downtown Kyiv to kill dozens of Ukrainians.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that goes to the lost legitimacy.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, he abdicated his responsibilities, he left and packed up his belongings.\xc2\xa0 Until this recent press conference, his whereabouts were not known.\xc2\xa0 And the Ukrainian parliament, which includes members from parties that represent all of Ukrainian society, has taken action through votes with substantial majorities, including votes from members of Mr. Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s party, to fill that vacuum and to stabilize the situation in Ukraine and to move forward with a plan to have early elections.\xc2\xa0 And that is all, in our view, appropriate and positive amidst a situation that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously quite fluid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to jump ahead to the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks this afternoon, some excerpts that have been released indicate that the President is going to accuse Republicans of only being focused on opportunities for a few, as opposed to opportunities for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 Does the President really believe that?\xc2\xa0 And is that a reflection of what we might see in the coming months that there really is just going to be nothing accomplished up on Capitol Hill, here in Washington, maybe in the White House and Republican leaders?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the frame the President has used and he\xe2\x80\x99ll use again is that he is focused on an agenda that is designed to expand opportunity for all.\xc2\xa0 He talks about this all the time.\xc2\xa0 And where he can find a partner in Congress, a partner in Republicans to advance that agenda on behalf of middle-class Americans and Americans who are striving to get into the middle class, he is eager to work together on that agenda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is simply a fact, if you look at budget presentations and policy presentations by Republicans in general, that their policies have -- in contrast to an agenda that is designed to expand opportunity for all -- generally either protected or expanded opportunity for the few.\xc2\xa0 And that includes protecting tax loopholes and benefits for the wealthiest and well-connected in our society.\xc2\xa0 And it includes, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about earlier this week, the refusal to entertain closing some of those loopholes as part of a compromise approach to dealing with our medium- and long-term deficit and debt challenges.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yes, the answer is the President will talk about why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for Democrats to advance an agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on expanding opportunity for all.\xc2\xa0 And as he has, and I have and others have, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly worth noting the contrast, and he will again tonight, with an agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on protecting the loopholes and prerogatives of the wealthiest and well-connected and, again, expanding or protecting opportunity for a few.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like a campaign -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a themed speech.\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9copportunity for a few,\xe2\x80\x9d yesterday you were saying Chairman Camp\xe2\x80\x99s tax proposal had some good potential to it.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I noticed how Republicans rallied around it.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President met with Speaker Boehner earlier this week, talked about immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Jim, obviously the President is doing --the President, like all Republican leaders, including those running for office themselves, is engaging in political events and he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking to the DNC.\xc2\xa0 And he will be supportive in many ways of Democrats either running for reelection or running for office in this cycle.</p>\n<p class="p4">In the meantime, he is principally focused on advancing an agenda that expands opportunity for all, that rewards hard work and responsibility.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you saw in the actions he announced yesterday at the \xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper\xe2\x80\x9d event.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on today in the White House Student Film Festival.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused -- was focused on in St. Paul when he talked about making the investments necessary to create jobs now and build our infrastructure in the future, and as part of an approach that would improve the tax code, the corporate tax code, but use those revenues generated by that to invest in our infrastructure.</p>\n<p class="p4">So the President is moving forward on an agenda, and he looks forward to finding cooperative and helpful partners in Congress among Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of that.\xc2\xa0 We have seen Republicans of late step away from the brink, step away from a tactic and a strategy and approach that did harm to our economy through shutdowns and threatened defaults, and instead come together through the budget agreement, come together through the omnibus funding agreement, come together through the decision to allow the United States to pay the bills that Congress racked up.\xc2\xa0 And these are positive developments and we look forward to cooperating in other areas if Republicans are willing and ready to find compromises on behalf of the American people.</p>\n<p class="p4">In the meantime, the President is absolutely going to continue to use his executive authority to advance an agenda that expands opportunity for all.</p>\n<p class="p4">Roger.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine has made a request to the IMF for about $15 billion to stabilize the country and so forth.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little update on where people are on that, where the U.S. is on negotiating that?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that we welcome the news that the IMF will send a team to Ukraine in the coming days.\xc2\xa0 And for our part, we are considering a range of options, including loan guarantees, to support Ukraine economically.\xc2\xa0 The next step is for the new government to resume talks with the IMF.\xc2\xa0 And as the government engages the IMF, we will also begin taking steps, in coordination with multilateral and bilateral partners and the new government, which could complement, as I mentioned earlier, an IMF package.</p>\n<p class="p4">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to the beginning of negotiations and discussions between the Ukrainian government and the IMF except that we support efforts to assist Ukraine as it enacts reforms and stabilizes its economy.\xc2\xa0 And we will be considering a range of options available to the United States to act in support in a complementary way of any IMF assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ukraine has had previous IMF loans.\xc2\xa0 Back in 2008, there was some trouble -- they balked at some of the conditions of the loan.\xc2\xa0 Does that cloud the talks this time around?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to refer you to the State Department and Treasury and the IMF.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the history, the back history on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Jared.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 In regards to Crimea, or in regards to Russia and Ukraine, what would be intervening?\xc2\xa0 How would you define intervention, I guess?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been some reports that suggest intervention, and we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about those and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking clarification.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re watching closely to see, as Secretary Kerry said, whether Russia might be \xe2\x80\x9ccrossing the line in any way,\xe2\x80\x9d the intervention line, if you will.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate or frame it beyond the reports and the concern that we\xe2\x80\x99re expressing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very clear what our position is, which is that Ukrainian territorial integrity needs to be respected, Ukrainian sovereignty needs to be respected, and it would be a grave mistake to intervene.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is our view that maintaining the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine is in the interest of the Ukrainian people and the interest of nations in the region, including Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to work with all partners to assist the Ukrainian government as it steps forward to deal with its economic challenges, and to move forward towards early elections that would provide another future government in Ukraine that reflects the will of all the Ukrainian people, that respects the rights of all the Ukrainian people, including minorities.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to watch the situation very closely when it comes to matters of potential intervention.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you get to the answer of whether Russia was behind the seizures?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys asking the Russians, hey, was this you?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you may not have an answer to that.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the ways that we monitor or all the conversations that we have around situations like this, except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re watching it very closely.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would this be crossing the line if it ended up being Russians or Russian security forces?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the individual reports and what our assessment is about what happened.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of, even in the reports themselves, contradictory information about some of the events, including the ones that have been raised here.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to evaluate each report and evaluate who is responsible and what actually happened.\xc2\xa0 We obviously as a government, and working with partners and allies, and communicating directly with Ukrainian leaders, as well as Russians leaders and others, finding as much -- getting as much information as we can about these reports.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how long it will take to try and get an answer behind the --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more for you on it.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President believe that the Russians are being aggressive vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Crimea and Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 Without using the word \xe2\x80\x9cintervention,\xe2\x80\x9d are they being aggressive?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a different word.\xc2\xa0 I think that we are concerned about reports of Russian intervention or Russian aggression.\xc2\xa0 So I would --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who would check intervention or aggression if it took place, the U.S. unilaterally?\xc2\xa0 NATO allies?\xc2\xa0 Who do we rely on to check that if they -- if we do believe they crossed that line?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We evaluate this, monitor this, engage in diplomatic discussions about this in a variety of ways -- both as the United States in partnership with our allies in the region, and in direct communications with the Ukrainian government and Russian government officials.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on the President\xe2\x80\x99s consultations with NATO allies on the issue of Ukraine?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any presidential conversations to update you on.\xc2\xa0 I noted the Secretary of State and the conversation he had with Foreign Minister Lavrov.\xc2\xa0 I note that Vice President Biden had a conversation with the new Prime Minister, which I think we read out, of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there are communications happening in real-time regarding this very fluid situation.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on a couple other topics we\xe2\x80\x99ve done -- that we may get to -- one is, for the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech today, which White House aides have indicated is a pretty major speech in terms of laying out the sort of framework for decisions Americans will make coming up at the end of this year, why at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday when document dumps normally take place?\xc2\xa0 Why deliver it then?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s when he is speaking to the DNC, which is the Democratic National Committee.\xc2\xa0 And we trust in our friends in the independent media to report the news.\xc2\xa0 So, hopefully, they\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the news on a Friday and a Saturday.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, fair enough -- fine.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you quickly about healthcare.gov right now?\xc2\xa0 Who is in charge of the implementation of healthcare.gov right now?\xc2\xa0 I know Jeffrey Zients is now working here as he begins his new responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 So who is presently in charge?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we actually announced it; we announced a successor to Jeff Zients, and obviously that operation is still run out of CMS.\xc2\xa0 But it is still very much -- and we talked about it at the time, when this was an hourly, not even to say a daily story, we knew once improvements were made and the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of Americans who were trying to use it, that there would be some diminution of interest in it, but our efforts and the team\xe2\x80\x99s efforts would not subside because the work was so important.\xc2\xa0 And the need to ensure that the website was continually improved and functioning effectively through the entire open enrollment period would be there, and that is the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re now on the eve of the final month in the six-month process, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that still needs to be done, and making sure that everybody gets out there who can use the information about the options available to them is getting that information is part of what we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do.\xc2\xa0 But another part of that is making sure that the website is functioning effectively.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given that the website now, according to the White House, appears to be functioning certainly much better than it was back in October --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a subject of doubt.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you said, \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You guys, as you regularly did when it was having problems --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 Here, let me ask the question.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- tested the hypothesis, \xe2\x80\x9cis it functioning effectively\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rather than waste time with semantics, what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is the website is functioning much better right now.\xc2\xa0 Fine, we stipulate that.\xc2\xa0 I want to know why then, if the people who are responsible for that, these high-tech wizards who made the fixes are the ones who are due for a lot of the credit, why the President never met with them following the fixes that ultimately put this --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t read out every meeting the President has.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he meet with them?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the President appreciates all the efforts of the entire team that has been involved in fixing the problems at healthcare.gov and in the general effort to implement the Affordable Care Act, which continues to this day.\xc2\xa0 This effort is not over, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t even be over after March 31st.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that\xe2\x80\x99s the open enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that will remain to be done, and that work will continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t read them all out, but did he meet with them at some point, though?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is responsible for the problems that not only the federal government had with its own website, but the state of Maryland, other states are having with their websites, which are funded by the federal government?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to CMS for general questions like that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that when it comes to some states that have had problems with their websites and their marketplaces, CMS issued guidance that allows state residents who are unable to sign up because of technical problems on those state websites to get federal tax credits if they bought private insurance outside of the new online insurance exchanges.\xc2\xa0 In other words, the subsidies available because of the Affordable Care Act remain available no matter how you get your insurance.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re making sure CMS is working closely with states to support their efforts to successfully implement their marketplace.\xc2\xa0 And that includes making sure that those who are eligible for subsidies are able to receive them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The criticism of that is that it sounds like yet another waiver. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about money that appears to have been wasted.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I see that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll posit that.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p class="p5">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about money that appears to have been wasted.\xc2\xa0 Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s website has already cost twice what was expected and needs more presumably federal money or an advance on federal money.\xc2\xa0 Where is the accountability here?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would ask you to check with CMS in terms of the interaction between CMS and individual state websites.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is when it comes to making sure that every American who has purchased insurance under the Affordable Care Act is able to get the benefits that are provided within the law, that CMS is working with the states to make sure that happens in those states where they\xe2\x80\x99ve had problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">I would also note that many states have run very effective exchanges and websites.\xc2\xa0 And, as I think was announced a couple of weeks ago or last week, California hit its target, its March 31st target in the middle of February in terms of enrollees.\xc2\xa0 So that one\xe2\x80\x99s working pretty well, I guess.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my point, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s all costing more than it was expected to cost.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details in front of me about that, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to CMS.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Jay, back to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 It seems that you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting, when you refer to reports, deep concern for reports of Russian intervention, you\xe2\x80\x99re not just talking about news reports that we -- the United States government through its other means has credible reports that the Russians have engaged in some kind of activity.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99m referring at this briefing to news reports, because there have been a variety of reports, some of them conflicting, some of them inconclusive about --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you also mentioned the U.S. government and our ability to --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was asked how we verify those reports or test -- or find out what has actually happened in these individual circumstances.\xc2\xa0 There have been a lot of reports about activity involving military personnel or apparently military personnel.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of referring to those reports and to our concern about them, and to the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re watching very closely to see if Russia is acting in any way that would cross the line when it comes to intervention in the affairs of a sovereign state.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what our national interest is in the territorial integrity of Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 I mean, take a region like Crimea, which was part of Russia until 1950, and then of course many years part of Ukraine but under the Soviet Union.\xc2\xa0 Why is it in the American national interest that Ukraine remain exactly as its borders are now?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because as a general principle we support the territorial integrity of states recognized under the U.N. Charter.\xc2\xa0 And we call on Russia to respect its international obligations under the U.N. Charter to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re referring to general principles here that guide the conduct of nations in the international community.</p>\n<p class="p4">So maintaining or recognizing Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, recognizing its sovereignty is something that nations have done, including Russia. \xc2\xa0Russia is party to agreements that recognize, including the Budapest Memorandum from I think the mid-1990s, that recognize Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s independence and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 And we call on nations to uphold their obligations under those agreements and under the U.N. charter.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about an intervention line, which I assume is something like a red line, it does raise the question of, well, then what?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how much of -- how important a national interest is this?\xc2\xa0 What are we going to do if --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what happens if this happens.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m going to focus on and what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is what is happening and what we can do to assist the Ukrainian people as they deal with the current circumstances that the country is in, both economically and politically, and to call on nations to respect Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, to respect Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s independence, to respect the right of the Ukrainian people to decide for themselves whether they want to, for example, integrate further with Europe; and to respect the fact that Ukraine has and will always have deep, historical and cultural ties to Russia, for example; and to integrate further with Europe and to maintain those deep ties that are both achievable and should be achievable.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not contradictory.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to respect the freedoms and liberties and civil rights of all of its citizens is a part of the bargain, if you will.\xc2\xa0 So we are making all those points in this circumstance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the meantime, when it comes to what-ifs, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on making clear our views about the responsibilities of other states not to intervene, and our concern about any reports that suggest there might have intervention.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should U.S. taxpayers be prepared to support transition in Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s support from the IMF.\xc2\xa0 Should we be prepared with an aid package?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re considerating our -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, considerating.\xc2\xa0 Did I say that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Friday -- just made up a word.\xc2\xa0 But we are considering our options.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\xc2\xa0 I kind of sounded legit, right?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re considering all of our options.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t made determinations about ways that we can assist either unilaterally or bilaterally to complement an IMF program of assistance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the fact that IMF officials will be traveling to Ukraine and that those conversations will take place.\xc2\xa0 We think that\'s important.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any decisions about additional assistance that the United States might provide.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then a quick political question.\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid, of course, is the top-ranked Democrat in Congress; took to the Senate floor to denounce the Koch brothers for -- accusing them of trying to buy America.\xc2\xa0 And he said they are about \xe2\x80\x9cas un-American\xe2\x80\x9d as anybody -- \xe2\x80\x9cas anyone I can imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What does the President make of the top Democratic leader basically talking about un-American activities on the Senate floor?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see that report and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about it, so I don\'t really have a response.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President consider the Koch brothers un-American?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about the Koch brothers. \xc2\xa0I think that in general -- because of the context here, we have seen again and again efforts to highlight individuals who have had problems with the Affordable Care Act, and again and again reporters have discovered that, in fact, the circumstances are not as they\'re being presented by either outside groups or Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s important.\xc2\xa0 And the work that\'s being done by reporters is important in making sure the whole story is told.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">We saw that with the rebuttal to the State of the Union address, when somebody who was highlighted as having problems with the Affordable Care Act, when reporters dug into that they found the circumstances to be different from what had been presented, and also the fact that the congresswoman\xe2\x80\x99s office hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even -- if you represent a constituency in Congress and there\xe2\x80\x99s been a law that\'s been passed, that\'s been upheld by the Supreme Court, that\'s being implemented that provides benefits to your constituents, whether you agree with the law or not, you would think you would be assisting your constituents in getting the benefits available to them.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get to this highly charged language of calling political opponents un-American --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forget what Reid said.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House endorse that kind of language aimed at political opponents?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the report.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is certainly some of the assertions that have been made in general about the Affordable Care Act have been proven to be wrong by your colleagues.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you suggesting it\xe2\x80\x99s un-American to make assertions that are proved wrong?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s clearly the language that you just said.\xc2\xa0 He asked you --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, Neil, you\xe2\x80\x99re misrepresenting entirely what I said, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stick to that.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No -- he said it\xe2\x80\x99s something un-American, and you say, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not answering that, but there is this.\xc2\xa0 So is there a suggestion -- are you making any suggestion whatsoever that to disagree with the administration and be wrong is somehow un-American?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Major.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m want to ask you about something that the Office of the Actuary of CMS put out last Friday about the effect of the Affordable Care Act on small businesses.\xc2\xa0 They put on a report\xc2\xa0 -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll quote from it directly -- using the community ratings provision requiring a higher level of quality of health care for small businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t provide it and didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide it before.\xc2\xa0 Directly from their report:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe are estimating that 65 percent of the small firms are expected to experience increases in their premium rates while the remaining 35 percent are anticipated to have rate reductions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It goes on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis results in roughly 11 million individuals whose premiums are estimated to be higher as a result of the ACA and about 6 million individuals who are estimated to have lower premiums.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does this mean that for a certain segment of Americans, as identified by the Office of the Actuary, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be paying more for the health care that they had before, and that in some respects does not align with the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall commitment that the ACA would deliver lower health care costs?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think -- and I answered questions about this earlier in the week -- that analysis looked at the impact of only one provision of the ACA; it did not look at the impact of subsidies and other provisions within the ACA.\xc2\xa0 The reports states the premiums are anticipated to stay same in average, and it finds that before the Affordable Care Act, 65 percent of these firms were paying below average and 35 percent were paying above average because insurers were allowed to discriminate against small employers who had an employee with a serious illness or more women than men.\xc2\xa0 In other words, discriminate against an employer because they felt that women could be charged double, for example, than men.\xc2\xa0 They can\'t do that anymore, which I think is the appropriate thing, because now everyone will be in the same pool.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of discrimination is no longer allowed under the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you look at the law as a whole, several studies have found that the ACA will help make coverage more affordable for people who get their health insurance through their job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we talked about this earlier in the week, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take into account all these other provisions within the Affordable Care Act that actually lowers costs; tax credits for small businesses; the medical loss ratio provision, which requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of their premiums on health care and not overhead, or administrative costs or CEO salaries; rate review, which requires insurers to publicly justify premium increases of 10 percent of more; the additional purchasing power that businesses get, small businesses, through the marketplace, because they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to band together and get the same leverage as small businesses.\xc2\xa0 And then, the ACA has brought more competition between issuers.\xc2\xa0 The ACA increases transparency and levels the playing field among insurers so that employers and individuals can have clear information on the products being offered.\xc2\xa0 That means issuers have to compete on price and quality, which in turn drives premiums down.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- your argument is that this phenomenon will not occur?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- they took one provision of the Affordable Care Act, and looked at it --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As they said, they were asked to look at three provisions; two were not relevant and one was.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Two were not relevant and one was, so they looked at that one provision, ruling out all the other provisions that actually mitigate the effect that they reported on.\xc2\xa0 And they took that one provision and said, what effect does that provision have.\xc2\xa0 And if you then don\xe2\x80\x99t isolate that out and look at the overall impact, as other outside analysts have done, you see that the ACA will help make coverage more affordable for Americans.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you are rooted to the talking points presented on Ukraine, but I want to try one more time on this.\xc2\xa0 You often tell us to evaluate not just words but actions of governments, of this administration, of political opponents.\xc2\xa0 There have been a lot of words exchanged between the Secretary of State and Lavrov all this week, and there were words exchanged between the President and Vladimir Putin last week.\xc2\xa0 In the main, would you say the actions on the ground in Ukraine had been consistent with Russian cooperation and consistent with the words expressed in this administration or not?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had very blunt and direct conversations with our Russian counterparts on this matter, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of conversations with other counterparts across the region, including --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you look at Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s words today, he appears to be frustrated; that what we\xe2\x80\x99re communicating is not getting through, and there is more concern of things being misinterpreted and actions being taken that could be misconstrued and that could turn this into a much more volatile situation than it already is.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the second part is definitely true.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned about actions that might be taken that could be misunderstood and that could lead to very problematic consequences.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re calling on all parties to be cautious in how they deal with this situation, and we\xe2\x80\x99re making clear our views that Ukrainian territorial integrity has to be respected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So when it comes to reports about potential intervention, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about them, and we\xe2\x80\x99re making clear that intervention would be a grave mistake.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re watching very closely, as Secretary Kerry said, to see whether or not Russia is crossing the line.\xc2\xa0 But this is certainly a challenging situation and one that we\xe2\x80\x99re watching closely.</p>\n<p class="p4">Jared.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked yesterday.\xc2\xa0 What, if any, reaction does the President have to the veto by Governor Brewer of SB1062?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, we don\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in as a rule on every piece of legislation under consideration, but the President does believe that Governor Brewer did the right thing by vetoing this bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Texas in April.\xc2\xa0 Has the President -- I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t read out the future travel schedule, so has the President expressed any enthusiasm or desire to visit another presidential library, the George W. Bush Presidential Library, which will be focusing an exhibit of his artwork starting in April?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, President Obama was there for the opening of the George W. Bush presidential library, an event he enjoyed very much, which included a private tour of the library, conducted by President George W. Bush and included, obviously, former President George H. W. Bush and former President Clinton, former President Carter.\xc2\xa0 It was a terrific event, and the President enjoyed it very much, he spoke at that event.\xc2\xa0 And then, as you know, President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush joined the President on Air Force One, and the President very much enjoyed being able to see some of the art that President Bush has worked on.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten a soup\xc3\xa7on of the art; he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the full --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the full exhibit of the --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Merci.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he at all desirous to see the full exhibit once it\xe2\x80\x99s on display?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m a layperson; I\xe2\x80\x99m not an art expert.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty impressed by the former President\xe2\x80\x99s work, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating.\xc2\xa0 And if there is -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was making an exhibit out of it at the library, but I think that would only add value and interest to visiting the library.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the national outcry over that bill, including from business leaders, both Republican senators from Arizona, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, does the President see a window of opportunity to make a statement against discrimination by signing an executive order protecting LGBT workers?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on that matter.\xc2\xa0 We, of course, hope very much that further action will be taken in Congress on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that if it became law would be far more comprehensive in its effect.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter -- and I said this when asked about the Arizona bill last week -- that the President believes that all Americans regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity should be treated fairly and equally, with dignity and respect.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was gratifying to see Americans from all walks of life, including business leaders, faith leaders regardless of party speak out against this measure.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s further evidence that the American people fundamentally believe in equality.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get on the right side of history.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned before, and I think we all note with pride and amazement the progress that this country has made on these issues in recent years.\xc2\xa0 And I think this veto reflects on that progress and on the sentiment of the American people.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you agree that this veto is a symbol of that progress, isn\xe2\x80\x99t an executive order a more immediate step to take advantage of this opportunity, as opposed to encouraging Congress to take action, which would take a longer amount of time?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new information to provide to you on a hypothetical executive order.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is we do support legislation that would enshrine in law the non-discrimination approach the President believes is the right approach for the country.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Victoria.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that it would be a grave mistake for Russia to cross the line with regard to intervention in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reality, a political reality that there would not be a political consequence for Russia to cross that line, given their size and their significance as a country?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Victoria, that\xe2\x80\x99s another way of asking me what would or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen if that grave mistake were committed.\xc2\xa0 And I think I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate except to point to our concern, to point to our strongly held view that it would be a grave mistake to intervene and to point to the fact that we would not be alone in holding that view.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what might happen if actions were taken that cross that line.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Given that Russia is on the U.N. Security Council, do you hold out any hope for any kind of resolution condemning what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of what specific action, if any, the Security Council is contemplating.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to our representation at the United Nations for Ambassador Power\xe2\x80\x99s view on that action.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Fred?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, on -- there was a poll published this week by the Chronicle for Higher Education that said only 11 percent of business leaders believe that college students, college graduates are prepared to take on jobs.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about making more students college- and career-ready.\xc2\xa0 Does he think that colleges are making students career-ready?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first question.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen that report.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that he and Secretary Duncan are very focused on the need to have opportunities available to young Americans so that they are getting the education they need to fill the jobs and the good-paying jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0 And that is reflected in the jobs-driven training that the Vice President -- the effort on the President\xe2\x80\x99s behalf that the Vice President is overseeing, and that we had a very big meeting about with leaders of many, many universities and colleges not that long ago.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think, again, not knowing the details of the poll, I think it reflects a challenge that we face as a nation, which is to make sure that we are harnessing the great potential of our people, as well as those who come and study here in our excellent universities and colleges, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re also providing opportunities through community colleges and other educational institutions that ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting -- our people are getting the training they need for the jobs -- the job opportunities that are there.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a broader challenge.\xc2\xa0 I know Secretary Duncan has done a lot of work on this subject, but it does reflect one of the concerns we have about improving our education system so that young Americans are getting the education and skills they need to fill the jobs of tomorrow.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, more than 100,000 people made public comment on the proposed IRS regulations for 501(c)(4) groups.\xc2\xa0 A lot of those were negative.\xc2\xa0 Some former FEC commissioners weighed in on this, thought that this was an area the IRS shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really get into.\xc2\xa0 What is the -- has the White House really come out on these IRS proposals for 501(c)(4)?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you probably remember, one of the recommendations by the inspector general was \xe2\x80\x9crecommend to IRS chief counsel and the Department of the Treasury the guidance\xe2\x80\x9d on how to measure the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary activity\xe2\x80\x9d of 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations be included for consideration in the Department of the Treasury priority guidance plan.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s obviously a mouthful.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that this action was recommended by the independent inspector general who had already looked into some of the matters that caused all the concern that we saw last year on these issues.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have much more to say on that.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that beginning in 2010 Treasury and the IRS received requests from members of Congress to consider engaging in the rulemaking to clarify the rules regarding these organizations, and as the Treasury Department has said, the rule change does not restrict any form of political speech.\xc2\xa0 These regulations do not favor any individual or political party or group.\xc2\xa0 The regulation applies to all organizations regardless of political affiliation.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure IRS would have, or Treasury would have more for you on that.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the opponents of this believe it sort of might codify what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in 2012, 2010, and they don\'t --</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would point you to the fact that the inspector general recommended the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here and to the statement I just made, which reflects what Treasury has said about it.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what we have:</p>\n<p class="p4">On Monday, President Obama will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing with the Prime Minister progress in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, developments in Iran, and other regional priorities.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s visit is a demonstration of the deep and enduring bonds between the United States and Israel, and our close consultations on a range of security issues.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 News conference?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specifics.\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re going to make statements, but I don\'t have anything more for you on that.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a time?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more for you on it.</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a time?</p>\n<p class="p3">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
