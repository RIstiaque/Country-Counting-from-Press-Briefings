Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:16 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here today.\xc2\xa0 I know there are several matters that I\'m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll be interested in discussing today, a couple of issues that are under investigation by the FBI -- and I thought I would start with that and then take your questions.</p>\n<p>As you saw from a statement from the FBI, as well as a statement from the United States Secret Service, there was a letter sent to, addressed to the President that at an offsite mail facility was noticed to have contained a suspicious substance in tests that were undertaken.\xc2\xa0 The FBI has the lead in that investigation, of course, and has said in its statement that they will be conducting further tests to determine what the nature of the substance is.</p>\n<p>Of course, there was another letter, as you know, sent -- or detected by Capitol Police that was sent to a United States senator.\xc2\xa0 That also has been -- is a subject of the investigation by the FBI.\xc2\xa0 And for more information about these matters I refer you to the FBI.</p>\n<p>The President -- I\'m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll ask this -- the President has, of course, been briefed on these letters.\xc2\xa0 He was briefed last night and again this morning.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there is obviously a lot of interest in the explosions in Boston, and I wanted to make clear, as you heard from the President yesterday, that our hearts and prayers go out to the victims and to their families who were injured -- those who were injured as well as killed in this heinous and cowardly act.\xc2\xa0 The full weight of the federal government is behind this investigation, which is being led by the FBI.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said, we will find out who did this, we will find out why, and we will bring those responsible to justice.</p>\n<p>That said, it is very important that we allow this investigation to run its full course and to ensure that we retain the integrity of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, on matters related to the investigation, I would direct you to the FBI.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the FBI is giving the press briefings on the ground in Boston and I believe they will be holding another briefing today.</p>\n<p>The President, as you know, has been briefed regularly on the incident in Boston, beginning almost immediately after it took place.\xc2\xa0 This morning, the President again convened a meeting in the Oval Office with his national security team on the ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 Participating in that briefing was the Attorney General, Eric Holder; the FBI Director, Robert Mueller; the President\xe2\x80\x99s Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough; his National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon; his Homeland Security Advisor and Counterterrorism Advisor, Lisa Monaco; Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken; White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler; Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Mastromonaco; Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes; and the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan.</p>\n<p>As you know, tomorrow morning the President will travel to Boston to speak at an interfaith service dedicated to those who were gravely wounded or killed in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s bombing.\xc2\xa0 I have a scheduling update for you on that -- the First Lady will be joining the President on the trip to Boston.</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the public is already pretty nervous given the situation in Boston.\xc2\xa0 Has the FBI told the White House anything about whether the letters that have been received are related to the Boston incident?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the statement that the FBI put out.\xc2\xa0 It is my understanding that they have not made that connection.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to the FBI for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if they\xe2\x80\x99re not making that connection, or if they ruled out the connection?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the FBI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this point there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can say to the public to reassure them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that in line -- as you know, for a long time now, there have been long-established procedure and protocols.\xc2\xa0 Any time a suspicious powder is located in a mail facility it is tested.\xc2\xa0 And I would underscore that the mail is screened, the mail sent here is screened, and that these tests are undertaken at remote sites to mitigate the risk both to those recipients and to the general population.\xc2\xa0 The FBI has the lead for determining whether a suspicious powder is a dangerous substance, such as a ricin.\xc2\xa0 And those take place at accredited facilities, and they take a certain amount of time, as the FBI has indicated.</p>\n<p>These procedures are in place.\xc2\xa0 The procedures are effective and in operation now.\xc2\xa0 And we are in the midst of that process, which the FBI is undertaking at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can say about whether there is any connection between the letters and the Boston incident?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the FBI, which has the lead in the investigation into each matter, and what they have said about this and their assessments on any connection between these two matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I imagine you will probably point me to the FBI on this as well, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask.\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication on the Boston explosions on whether this looks to be a foreign terrorist incident or a domestic incident?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President said yesterday remains true today, which is that there is an active investigation ongoing.\xc2\xa0 We have the full weight of the federal government behind this investigation being led by the FBI.\xc2\xa0 All components of the federal government are assisting -- including the intelligence community and others -- assisting state and local authorities and the FBI in this investigation.</p>\n<p>As the President said, we do not know at this time yet whether it was an organization or an individual, foreign or domestic.\xc2\xa0 But we will find out and we will hold accountable and bring to justice whoever is responsible.\xc2\xa0 But this investigation is now not even 48 hours old.\xc2\xa0 And it is important that we maintain the integrity of the investigation.</p>\n<p>It is important, as both state and local law enforcement officials and government officials as well as federal officials have made clear, that the American people provide whatever information they might have that could be of assistance in this investigation.\xc2\xa0 There is an 800-number -- 1-800-CALL-FBI -- which has been put out to provide a method for individuals who might have information to contact law enforcement on this matter.\xc2\xa0 And that is absolutely the responsible thing to do.</p>\n<p>But the details of the progress of the investigation, assessments about -- preliminary assessments about who may be responsible I will not make, and I think that as a matter of upholding the integrity of the investigation, others will not as well.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s still police tape across or around Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.\xc2\xa0 Is that a temporary measure or is -- have there been any other threats to the White House that -- other than these letters?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secret Service said yesterday that out of -- and through normal procedures and through an abundance of caution that certain actions are taken.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to them for any details about the perimeter and any actions the Secret Service might be taking today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President discouraged at all by the fact that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t more leads in the Boston bombings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say one way or the other, because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to allow the investigators to do their work. He is being briefed on this regularly.\xc2\xa0 He had a substantial meeting earlier today.\xc2\xa0 Lisa Monaco, his Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor, is updating him continuously throughout the day and the evening and the night on these matters.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize his view of the investigation because that would then characterize the investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will his message be in Boston tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It will be one of resolve.\xc2\xa0 It will be one of the commonality that we all feel as Americans with the people of Boston and those who were visiting Boston for the marathon, and who both endured this horrific event and then demonstrated their bravery in its immediate aftermath.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I would, obviously, ask you to wait until you hear his remarks, but as you heard him say yesterday from this podium, the way that the people of Boston and the city of Boston responded reminds us and reminds the world of just who we are as a people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 How did he react to the briefings about the letters that were addressed to him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on these matters.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to characterize his reaction.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he understands and we all understand that there are procedures in place, as the FBI has said.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place that ensures that materials that are suspicious or substances that are found to be suspicious at remote locations are then sent for secondary and more intense testing, and that process is underway now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question, at the end of the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s statement, they say there is no indication of a connection to the attack in Boston.\xc2\xa0 They won\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly rule out a connection, nor will you.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point to the FBI, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve just cited, where they say there is no indication.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear statement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that leaves open the possibility of a connection.\xc2\xa0 So it would be reassuring if you could stand there and say there is no connection.\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the significance?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s for the investigating authorities to say.\xc2\xa0 They have made a fairly clear statement, which I was suggesting to Julie that was available in the statement they put out.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to assess it further from here.\xc2\xa0 I would remind you that these investigations, both of the bombings in Boston and the letters in question here, are just underway.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume to characterize the nature of the investigations.\xc2\xa0 I would point to the statement by the FBI, as you said, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made that says they have no indication of a connection between the two.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of letters now.\xc2\xa0 Well, first, may I clarify?\xc2\xa0 The statement refers to two different facilities.\xc2\xa0 We also know of a letter that was sent to Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify -- is that three facilities and letters total, or just two?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the FBI.\xc2\xa0 My understanding -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of is a letter sent to a member of the Senate and a letter sent to the President.\xc2\xa0 But I -- there have been reports I think the FBI has said of other potential letters.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the statement by the FBI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given the number of letters and possible packages, suspicious packages up there, is this concerning to the administration that there is something else going on here, that there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody trying -- a follow-on, a lone wolf, somebody trying to capitalize on the concern after Boston?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think those are questions that the investigators are looking to answer.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what the FBI has said already, what the Secret Service has said and make clear, that we have had procedures in place for quite some time now when it comes to the processing of mail sent to the White House complex that ensure that that mail is processed at an offsite facility to mitigate any risk to potential recipients here and to the general public, and that those procedures have been in place for some time and have been effective.</p>\n<p>I would ask you to check with the FBI to see what assessments they\xe2\x80\x99ll make along the lines that you\'re asking, but this is, again, very early.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask one more, which is, is this something that happens every so often and we just don\'t hear about it because there\xe2\x80\x99s not as much interest in this kind of thing?\xc2\xa0 Or is this an unusual occurrence?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the FBI and the Secret Service are best to ask these questions of because they handle the processing of, or the investigation of, in one case, and Capitol Police and the Secret Service handle the assessments of it.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly the case, I think as the FBI has pointed out, that when preliminary tests are done, secondary and I suppose tertiary tests are made because of the need for accuracy and to be sure about what the substances might be.\xc2\xa0 But for the history of this I would refer you to the FBI, the Secret Service and the Capitol Police.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the letter -- or the envelope received here, did it have the same return address as --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was not received here, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, received at the facility -- but the envelope sent to the President, did it have the same return address as the one --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a subject of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 I have no information on the nature of the mailing label or the return address.\xc2\xa0 That would be for the FBI to address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know if there was a letter in this envelope, or was it just a --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have no -- the reason why I opened with a statement about it is to make clear that this is a matter under investigation by the FBI and that they have the lead in both investigating and providing information on that investigation to the public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you something you definitely know about --\xc2\xa0 the gun control votes on Capitol Hill today.\xc2\xa0 It certainly looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s going down in defeat.\xc2\xa0 What does this say?\xc2\xa0 What happens next?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to continue his fight on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes very strongly that the Senate should pass the background checks bill.\xc2\xa0 You have heard him speak passionately about this issue.\xc2\xa0 The families of Newtown victims have been in Washington speaking to lawmakers about the need to pass common-sense legislation to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This was always going to be difficult.\xc2\xa0 We said that from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 The reason why these common-sense provisions aren\'t law already is because they are difficult, and there is no question that the path to 60 in this case is difficult, but it is not unachievable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we hope that members of the Senate, after speaking with Newtown families who are on Capitol Hill right now meeting with lawmakers, consider who they\xe2\x80\x99re representing.\xc2\xa0 Ninety percent of the American people support expanded background checks.\xc2\xa0 Majorities in every state where there is data available overwhelmingly support background checks -- every state.\xc2\xa0 Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, independents support background checks.</p>\n<p>If you were opposed to this legislation, you should obviously explain why, and you should explain why you are for something that 90 -- you are against something that 90 percent of the people are for, that vast majorities of the people in your state support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of bogus information about what is in this amendment that was crafted by two \xe2\x80\x9chighly-rated\xe2\x80\x9d by the NRA senators -- a senator from West Virginia, one of the states with the strongest gun cultures in the country; a senator from Pennsylvania, a conservative Republican -- claims about the establishment of a gun registry, which are bogus.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the legislation itself explicitly prohibits the establishment of a gun registry.\xc2\xa0 So members of the Senate ought to ask themselves, who are they representing?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You sound frustrated.\xc2\xa0 Is the President frustrated?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President wants this done.\xc2\xa0 But this is not about the President.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about those families; it\xe2\x80\x99s about the families of Aurora; it\xe2\x80\x99s about the families in Oak Creek; it\xe2\x80\x99s about the families in Virginia Tech.\xc2\xa0 And it is common-sense, reasonable legislation to pass to close loopholes that prevent people who should not, by law, have access to a gun from obtaining a gun.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s expanding a background check system that exists already.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what do you do now?\xc2\xa0 This was the single-best chance you had to pass legislation.\xc2\xa0 What are you going to do now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- Jon, what I won\xe2\x80\x99t do, as a rule, is give post-game analysis before the game is over.\xc2\xa0 This vote has not happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You still think this can pass today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I still think that each senator has to decide for himself or herself how they\'re going to vote ultimately.\xc2\xa0 What they tell the press or what they tweet about is not the same as what they vote.\xc2\xa0 And there is an opportunity for 60 senators to do the right thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President still making calls on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everybody in the White House is working on this issue from the President on down.</p>\n<p>Yes, Major.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House satisfied with the timing of this vote?\xc2\xa0 It is my impression that there were those in this building who thought you might have more time, maybe as much as a week before this vote would be held.\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied with the way that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has brought this to the floor today where it appears, as Jonathan said, it\xe2\x80\x99s heading for defeat?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The way that the Senate runs is obviously handled by the Senate Majority Leader and others in leadership.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we would be voting on -- that the Senate would be voting on a bipartisan, common-sense compromise amendment that would establish an expanded background check system has been known for some time.</p>\n<p>Now, it is certainly the case that every senator should have read this amendment.\xc2\xa0 And if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t, they should be ashamed.\xc2\xa0 They should read it before they vote, especially if they were going to vote no.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give post-game analysis before the game has occurred.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that we believe --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking -- I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- we believe that 60 senators -- that there is a path, a very difficult path but a path to get to 60.\xc2\xa0 There ought to be a path to get 100.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that path be more achievable if you had more time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- that\'s a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Look, we have been talking about background checks for some time.\xc2\xa0 The compromise negotiated admirably by Senators Machin and Toomey has been under discussion for some time and it has been public now for a number of days.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a complicated issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a 90-10 issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so I\xe2\x80\x99m saying --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you straight out there\xe2\x80\x99s no material difference whether you vote -- the Senate votes next week or today?\xc2\xa0 The President is making calls.\xc2\xa0 He made calls yesterday. I assume he made them this morning.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the Senate will vote, and whenever it votes, it ought to pass this amendment.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s complicated about the fact that 90 percent of the American people want this done?\xc2\xa0 And yet a substantial percentage of the Senate at least seems to disagree with the vast majority of the American people, to disagree with the vast majority of the people of their states?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about the President.\xc2\xa0 They disagree with the families of Newtown.\xc2\xa0 They disagree with those who still grieve over their losses in Aurora.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you quickly about two things with Boston.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, with the security the President talked about in other cities -- precautions taken just necessarily, the visibility here, the edginess around Capitol Hill -- does the President feel any burden tomorrow, in addition to talking about what happened, the tragedy in Boston, to give the country some sense of how to cope with the edginess that I think all of us feel is creeping into the consciousness of the country after what happened in Boston?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President say that we will not be terrorized.\xc2\xa0 And I think you saw and have seen in the reaction of the people of Boston and in the reaction of Americans across the country the proof of that statement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s who we are.\xc2\xa0 And you heard him say this yesterday, the President, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will echo that sentiment tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on that, Jay, a lot of people are starting to talk about how, whether these incidents are connected or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s feeling a little bit like 2001 with the terror attack and then, in fact, these suspicious letters and people being concerned.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe, does the President believe the nation is under attack again?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You heard the President address the bombings in Boston twice now.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him again tomorrow in Boston.\xc2\xa0 He has been briefed on the letters and updated on the fact that the FBI is investigating and that further tests are being done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President made a commitment yesterday and the day before that we will find who is responsible for the bombings in Boston and bring them to justice.\xc2\xa0 We will -- obviously the FBI will make assessments about these letters, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll proceed from there once we know.\xc2\xa0 But I think first things first, Ed.\xc2\xa0 Before we speculate, before we make connections that we do not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said we don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s connected --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the question you asked was very broad in nature, and I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that before we speculate or make connections that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know exist, that the FBI has made a clear statement about, we need to get the facts.\xc2\xa0 The President bases his judgments and the things he says to the American people on the facts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned at all about the pace of the investigation in Boston?\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s having these meetings with his team -- the FBI Director and others -- is he expressing any concern?\xc2\xa0 I know you said earlier it\xe2\x80\x99s only been 48 hours and that is an important point to make, but there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot of people wondering why there\xe2\x80\x99s not a suspect yet.\xc2\xa0 Is the President expressing frustration in private about the pace of it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has faith in the FBI, which has the lead, and faith in the entire national security and homeland security team.\xc2\xa0 It has not even been 48 hours.\xc2\xa0 And it is important to allow for this investigation to proceed and to maintain the integrity of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 But the President is very confident in all of the agencies at the federal level that are involved, putting the full weight of the federal government behind this investigation, and he is confident that we will find who is responsible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he get any sense in the latest briefing this morning that they\xe2\x80\x99re on the verge of any sort of breakthrough in Boston?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize the investigation or progress being made in the investigation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to maintain the integrity of the investigation and to allow the FBI and all the others involved to do the essential work that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last thing.\xc2\xa0 A delicate issue, but as Major was talking about, the gun issue that\xe2\x80\x99s up there, immigration reform. Anytime there\xe2\x80\x99s a major incident, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with North Korea or there\xe2\x80\x99s a terror attack on American soil, it preoccupies some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xc2\xa0 How does he balance this now as he\xe2\x80\x99s pushing all these important issues that he\xe2\x80\x99s made a top priority on the Hill that needs his attention -- needs him calling senators, but also dealing with the FBI Director, figuring out the investigation?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House at all -- first of all, how do you balance that?\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned at all that some of this now overshadows his push on the domestic front?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, these are all top priorities.\xc2\xa0 The top and highest priority for this President is the safety and security of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the bombings in Boston, the explosions in Boston that killed and maimed people have his absolute focus.\xc2\xa0 And he has directed the entire federal government, with the FBI at the lead, to make this investigation its priority.</p>\n<p>There are also many other issues that are essential to making progress in this country -- on reducing gun violence, on fixing our terribly broken immigration system, on helping our economy grow and create jobs -- and that is the absolute nature of the world we live in and the business that we need to conduct. And the President is focused on all of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you give us a better sense -- we know the President will be speaking at that interfaith service tomorrow in Boston that he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling to now we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned with his wife, the First Lady.\xc2\xa0 Are there any other plans in the course of tomorrow to visit privately with any of the victims or the victims\xe2\x80\x99 family members?\xc2\xa0 Has he had conversations to this point with any of those individuals?\xc2\xa0 What more color can you give us besides just his remarks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no other updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 If there are changes or additions, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly make you aware of them.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has been in contact with officials in Massachusetts and Boston.\xc2\xa0 I have no other conversations related to the incidents in Boston, the bombings in Boston to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0 But the President will obviously be seeing a number of people on the ground in Boston, including local and state officials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Acknowledging that none of it really matters until the votes take place at the Capitol today on the gun bill, background checks bill, I want to get the sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s message is specifically to those Democrats, including Heidi Heitkamp, who just a matter of moments ago said she will vote no on that.\xc2\xa0 What does he say to the Democrats, six of whom at this point seem to be saying they will not vote in support of this?\xc2\xa0 And with those six, he could have the 60 that are necessary.\xc2\xa0 What does he say to the members of his party who haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- or say they will not support this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that every senator ought to support common-sense legislation to reduce gun violence, 100 of them.\xc2\xa0 He believes that something like legislation that expands and improves our background check system as the amendment that Senators Toomey and Manchin have put forward should garner the support in the Senate that it has in the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But make no mistake that on this matter and on this issue, as is the case on others related to reducing gun violence, the overwhelming number of Democrats support it, and the overwhelming number of Republicans oppose it.\xc2\xa0 And that is a shame.</p>\n<p>And again, when it comes to background checks, this is not a question of different states see this differently.\xc2\xa0 In state after state after state, the support is overwhelming.\xc2\xa0 Blue states, red states, purple states, more rural states, more urban states.\xc2\xa0 The American people have been clear that this is common sense, that it does not in any way infringe upon Second Amendment rights that this President supports and that the American people support.\xc2\xa0 It ought to pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask about immigration in a moment, but one more question I\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss if I didn\'t ask you regarding guns, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said -- only a matter of hours ago today, he accused the President of using the Newtown families as, and it was his word, \xe2\x80\x9cprops.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s response to that accusation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if Senator Paul met with the Newtown families, but the Newtown families aren\xe2\x80\x99t here for the President.\xc2\xa0 They\'re here because their children were murdered.\xc2\xa0 They\'re here asking for the Senate to do something that\'s common sense.\xc2\xa0 That\'s my response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk a little bit about tonight\xe2\x80\x99s dinner with Democratic senators, why the President wanted to meet with members of his own party, and also whether the President is prepared to talk about chained CPI, if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to come up and if the President might be able to defend his position on that, or talk about his position?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a variety of topics will come up.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to meeting with a group of Senate Democrats.\xc2\xa0 He, as you know, has been engaged in, through a variety of modes, reaching out to lawmakers of both parties, and this is part of that process.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of business that he believes we need to get done here in Washington on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And Senate Democrats are key to that progress that he wants to see made.</p>\n<p>The White House worked with Senator Murray to put together this list for tonight.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President has previously had two dinners with Republican senators.\xc2\xa0 And you can be confident that his outreach will continue and these meetings, both large and small, will continue as he seeks to work with the Senate, work with the Congress, to get common-sense business done that the American people want their elected representatives to get done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a small thing, but is there any reason some of these dinners are at the White House and some are at the Jefferson Hotel?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have only been two so far, and this is the third.\xc2\xa0 I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re just mixing it up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back on the gun debate, who or what is the source of the bogus information that you mentioned a couple of minutes ago?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There have been accusations made or suggestions put out there that voting for the Manchin-Toomey amendment is a vote for a gun registry, which is on its face absurd and false and wrong.\xc2\xa0 The legislation itself prohibits that.\xc2\xa0 This is not a gun registry; it is the opposite of that.\xc2\xa0 It is expanding a background check system that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place for more than a decade and, where it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have loopholes, has been effective, has prevented criminals and those who are mentally unstable from obtaining weapons, people who should not obtain weapons.</p>\n<p>I mean, this is -- what should be clear to those senators who are considering this, because it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to the American people, is that this is just -- this is common sense.\xc2\xa0 If you are a responsible gun shop owner and you abide by the system that ensures that background checks are conducted, you want everyone else to have to abide by the same rules.\xc2\xa0 If you want to sell a firearm and you\xe2\x80\x99re a responsible citizen, you want to know whether the person you\xe2\x80\x99re selling that to is a criminal or is mentally unstable and should not have a weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s what the system that\xe2\x80\x99s already in place was designed to do and this amendment merely assures that the significant loopholes in that system are substantially closed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, can you specify who you see as the main source of the bogus information?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in so many places that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to keep track.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, it\xe2\x80\x99s out there and it\xe2\x80\x99s false. And I would urge senators who imagine that it\xe2\x80\x99s in there to read the legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect to hear from the President after today\xe2\x80\x99s votes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He feels very strongly about this obviously, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements.</p>\n<p>Nadia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I know the President said twice not to jump to conclusions when it comes to the people responsible for the attack.\xc2\xa0 But there is a fear of a backlash among the Arab and Muslim American community here.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can say on the podium to alleviate the fear?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply point you to and point everyone to the statement the President made, which is we should not jump to any conclusions.\xc2\xa0 We need to allow the investigation to run its course and to follow leads where those leads take them, and then we will know.\xc2\xa0 And before then, it\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful to jump to any conclusions, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the immigration bill.\xc2\xa0 President Obama spoke positively about the compromise offer yesterday, which does not include citizenship for same-sex couples of different nationalities.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President will push for in a final bill, or is this just the cost of compromise?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President did, as you know, meet yesterday with Senator Schumer and McCain, who briefed him on the bipartisan immigration reform bill that they have drafted and has now been submitted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the President said, this bill is clearly a compromise and no one will get everything they want from it, including the President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of compromise.\xc2\xa0 But the bill is largely consistent with the principles he has laid out repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 It would strengthen security at our borders and hold employers more accountable, and it would provide a pathway to earn citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are already in this country illegally.\xc2\xa0 And that is significant progress, as the President noted in his statement.</p>\n<p>This process will continue.\xc2\xa0 We will work with lawmakers of both parties as the bill is considered.\xc2\xa0 But it is very important to note that this is a bipartisan bill that represents compromise and reflects and is consistent with the principles that the President has long supported.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to let that provision go?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, this -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate out the process that will take some time in the Senate as this bill moves forward, or assess individual items within it.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly the case, as the President said in his statement, that not everything in the bill reflects how he would write it, but it broadly is consistent with his principles.\xc2\xa0 And we will see --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He will sign it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have you ever seen a bill of this size go from inception to a President\xe2\x80\x99s desk unaltered?\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where this goes.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize any provision within it.\xc2\xa0 I want to broadly make the point that the President made yesterday that it is consistent with his principles and that this is significant and important progress.\xc2\xa0 And the members of the Gang of Eight should be commended for the progress they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\xc2\xa0 And this is a big piece of business that requires broad bipartisan support, and much work remains to be done.</p>\n<p>Mark, and then April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a small question.\xc2\xa0 The President had been scheduled to go to Kansas on Friday.\xc2\xa0 The White House said yesterday the trip would be put off.\xc2\xa0 Is that because the President wants to stay close to his advisors on the investigation, or just a purely logistical issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President obviously is traveling to Boston tomorrow, and that was a new trip that was placed on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 And the decision was made not to travel on Friday if we\xe2\x80\x99re traveling on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 And obviously with Boston, with what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on a variety of fronts, legislatively and otherwise, the President will remain here on Friday.\xc2\xa0 But all the issues that he would have talked about in Kansas and the issues that are before us today remain front and center.\xc2\xa0 And you will clearly hear from the President on all of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made any other amendments in his schedule in terms of the things he\xe2\x80\x99s doing here as a result of what happened in Boston and other related --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s had, obviously, a substantial number of briefings and meetings related to Boston that were added to schedule and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have those, but nothing else beyond that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had to cancel things because of all the additional briefings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>April, then Zach.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions on the letter.\xc2\xa0 Has mail to the White House been temporarily halted for now because of this suspicious letter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 The procedures that have been in place for some time now ensure that the mail sent to the White House complex is processed offsite to mitigate risk to the general public and to individuals who might be recipients of -- or designated recipients of that mail.\xc2\xa0 So for any adjustments in the procedure, if there are any, I would refer you to the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So proper procedures were in place at the time when the letter was received?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case, as the Secret Service and Capitol Police and the FBI have indicated, that the discovery of suspicious substances was made at offsite facilities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And on guns, what group or group of persons or person was really the problem when it comes to pushing this gun legislation through?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t over.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give a postmortem.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to assess the game, as I said to Jon, before the game is over.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to recalibrate the question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The senators ought to examine the bill, examine their consciousness, and then vote.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that this amendment gets 60 votes.</p>\n<p>There has long been, as you know, a variety of obstacles to passing common-sense legislation to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that nobody would have predicted four or five months ago that we would have gotten this far on a measure to expand the background check system.\xc2\xa0 But getting this far is not far enough.<br/>\n\tThis ought to be passed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It has the support of 90 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot of cynicism around here and some of it is merited. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t too many issues in America of significance that have 90 percent support from the American people.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t too many issues that rise to the prominence that this has risen to that enjoy that kind of broad-based support from Republicans, Democrats, independents, gun owners, non-gun owners, urban dwellers, people who live in rural areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so you have to wonder why this is so hard.\xc2\xa0 The senators who are voting no, if they vote no, represent the very people who have said overwhelmingly that they want this done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a shame.\xc2\xa0 But we believe -- we know there\xe2\x80\x99s a vast majority of the American people who support this, and we believe there should be 60 votes in the Senate to support it.</p>\n<p>Zach.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So following up on that, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been making this case for quite a long time, a couple of months now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just not getting enough support among senators to get to 60 votes.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of -- do you have a theory of why that is?\xc2\xa0 And is there anything you can do going forward?\xc2\xa0 Can you shame the senators by name who are not voting for it?\xc2\xa0 You seem pretty outraged by it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first let\xe2\x80\x99s wait for the vote and let\xe2\x80\x99s see how the individual senators decide this issue.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully there will be reason to be pleased by the outcome.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case, we\xe2\x80\x99ll assess that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the vote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it your expectation that the President will keep talking about gun violence, regardless of what happens tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that matters a lot to him.\xc2\xa0 I went with him to Newtown.\xc2\xa0 I went with him to Hartford.\xc2\xa0 Those of you who heard him speak in the immediate aftermath of Newtown know his passion on this issue as a father as well as a President.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict the future, because the future that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about is predicated upon failure of this legislation and we\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to concede that.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I send my deepest condolence to the victims and families in Boston.\xc2\xa0 President Obama said that what happened in Boston was an act of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 I would like to ask, do you consider the U.S. bombing on civilians in Afghanistan earlier this month that killed -- that left 11 children and a woman killed a form of terrorism?\xc2\xa0 Why or why not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would have to know more about the incident, and obviously the Department of Defense would have answers to your questions on this matter.\xc2\xa0 We have more than 60,000 U.S. troops involved in a war in Afghanistan, a war that began when the United States was attacked in an attack that was organized on the soil of Afghanistan by al Qaeda, by Osama bin Laden and others, and where 3,000 people were killed in that attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it has been the President\xe2\x80\x99s objective once he took office to make clear what our goals are in Afghanistan, and that is to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al Qaeda, and with that as our objective, to provide enough assistance to Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government to allow them to take over security for themselves.\xc2\xa0 And that process is underway.\xc2\xa0 The United States has withdrawn a substantial number of troops and we are in the process of drawing down further as we hand over security lead to Afghan forces.</p>\n<p>And it is certainly the case -- but I refer you to the Defense Department for details -- that we take great care in the prosecution of this war and we are very mindful of what our objectives are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, bombings in India?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, sir, one on bombings.\xc2\xa0 As far as these pressure-cooker bombings are common by the al Qaeda Lashkar-e-Taiba, and this happened yesterday after just 24 hours before in Boston, in Bangalore in India, and scores were injured.\xc2\xa0 And there was 13 pressure-cooker bombings in India, Bombay, Delhi, Madras and also Jaipur among other cities, major cities.\xc2\xa0 And those were all pressure-cooker bombings.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see any connection here involving these bombings?\xc2\xa0 These people are against the democracies and peace-loving people.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department for information about our response or view on the incidents that you refer to.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on the investigation here into the bombings in Boston.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, sir, on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Last week, there was a big demonstration by the legals, illegals and citizens and among others on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And also on Capitol Hill, dozens of Indian AAPI members, Indian American Physician Association members, gathered on Capitol Hill, and they were asking the President, which they supported him, that it takes about nine years for a physician or doctor to get green card in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And what they were saying that this comprehensive immigration bill should include those who are waiting legally to be entering the U.S. or their spouses overseas for about nine, 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And finally, it took 21 years for --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Goyal, I need a question because you have a lot of people here waiting for you to finish.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It took 21 years for one person to get green card, and he left his family behind in India, and now he got just last week.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the need for comprehensive immigration reform is clear.\xc2\xa0 That reform must improve our legal immigration system.\xc2\xa0 It must provide a clear pathway to citizenship for those 11 million who are here illegally.\xc2\xa0 It must provide for enhanced border security to build on the efforts we have made thus far.\xc2\xa0 It must hold employers accountable in the ways that I discussed earlier.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s called comprehensive.</p>\n<p>Thanks, very much, guys.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:04 P.M.
