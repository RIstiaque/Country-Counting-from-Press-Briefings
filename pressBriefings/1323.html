EDT<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming along for the ride.\xc2\xa0 Any questions?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given that Obama and Medvedev say they\xe2\x80\x99ve got this really close, candid relationship, has Obama reached out to him to talk about the arrest of the alleged Russian spies?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been contact at other levels of the government, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any contact between the President and Medvedev.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something you might plan on doing?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, why did the President decide to take on an aggressive tone with the Republicans today in his speech?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that there are these important moments where there is some clarity about how our view of the world contrasts with the Republican view of the world.\xc2\xa0 In this case, the President is going to talk in stark terms about the difference in what we saw as the cause and cost of the financial crisis and what we needed to do about it, and what their view of the financial crisis was, which was that it was just an \xe2\x80\x9cant.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nThe President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it was no small thing that brought our economy to its knees and allowed some risky bets on Wall Street to cause millions of Americans to lose their jobs, that caused many Americans to lose their life savings, and put us in a really bad place that we\xe2\x80\x99re just now getting ourselves out of.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many Republicans do you expect to pick up in the Senate on the financial regulation vote?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m no vote-counter myself, but enough to get it passed.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, can you preview for us his immigration speech at American?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot in the news about immigration lately.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been the Arizona law, there\xe2\x80\x99s been meetings about it, there\xe2\x80\x99s been protests about it.\xc2\xa0 He thought this was a good time to talk plainly with the American people about his views on immigration. Most specifically, he thinks this debate is about accountability -- accountability for securing the border, accountability for employers who are hiring illegal immigrants, and accountability for those who are in this country illegally.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about that tomorrow.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to give Congress a timeline at all?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a specific timeline, no.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you anticipating anything new out of that speech that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard in one way, shape, or form?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President give a speech on immigration reform before, so I think a lot of the elements will be familiar to you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all offended by Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of Romanoff?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 It sounds to me like just a difference of opinion in a primary.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gibbs was asked yesterday if the White House had any heads up on that.\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if you guys got any heads up?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did not?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You all found out when everybody else found out?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what the reaction inside the White House was?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It was -- there is a lot of things that happen in the White House every day.\xc2\xa0 This was just one of those things where, okay, we have a difference of opinion in this primary.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Along the -- since this is about the economy, what is the President going to say, if anything, about the fact that in the last few days the economic numbers, if anything, are getting worse?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it reflected in the stock market.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen consumer confidence drop.\xc2\xa0 What -- how does he deal with that given that this is something obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s been focused on for a long time?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President has been very focused on the economy since the beginning of this administration and he shares the dissatisfaction that many Americans have that progress is not happening faster.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot to stand up the financial industry to make sure that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t collapse, to put Americans back to work, to help our economy grow.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work that needs to get done, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you see some of the proposals the President has continued to move through Congress, be it on financial regulatory reform or the extenders package that we think is important for a lot of separate issues.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nSo the President is going to talk about some of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, but also about a lot of the hard work that still is needed to be done.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the fact that consumer confidence index went down, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t spending as much money, are there any conversations going on about changing course or trying to get some new policies?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the consumers spoke pretty clearly in that report.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that there\xe2\x80\x99s never a shortage of new, good ideas, so of course he\xe2\x80\x99s always willing to listen to anything that can help spur faster, stronger economic growth.\xc2\xa0 But, no, there\xe2\x80\x99s no change in course from what the President thinks is an important American mission, which is to get our economy back on track, create jobs, and stabilize things for the future.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why do you think that people don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be responding to that?\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings on handling the economy are not strong?\xc2\xa0 More people disapprove of what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing on the economy than approve of it.\xc2\xa0 Overall consumer confidence -- even what you said, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously said those things before -- why is that the case?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are tough economic times for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And like I said, the President shares the frustration of folks that progress is not being made as quickly as he wishes it were.\xc2\xa0 He wishes that all the Americans who lost their jobs in the recession were back to work, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stop fighting and stop working to ensure that they get back to work until that happens.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nSo until Americans start to feel for themselves that the economy is getting better, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough time.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert in polls, but polling is going to reflect that.\xc2\xa0 But regardless, the President is focused on doing everything that he can to strengthen the economy and to move us forward.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, are you bracing for bad news on Friday when the Labor Department report comes out?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The jobs report is something where we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the numbers in advance and you brace for anything being possible here.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the numbers now.\xc2\xa0 I obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t know the numbers, but I will tell you that unless that report says that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made back every single job that was lost during the recession, the President is going to be -- is not going to be satisfied and is going to continue to work as hard as ever to put Americans back to work.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does he think about Larry King quitting?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about it.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the excerpts that were released, obviously he still aims foursquare against Congressman Boehner.\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to elevate this?\xc2\xa0 What is it that he wants out of Boehner at this point?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the -- can you talk a little bit about his decision to go after him in a pretty direct, personal way?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think you missed a little bit of this with a sneezing fit at the beginning of the gaggle.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the President thinks this is a moment that helps to illustrate some of the differences between what he\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to do and what Republicans in Congress would like to do.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that the financial crisis has actually been an enormous deal for the American people, especially those who have lost their jobs and have lost their savings as a result.\xc2\xa0 Apparently on the other side, right up to the very top leadership, they think that it was basically an ant.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a difference of opinion that the President thinks is worth talking about.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick McChrystal question.\xc2\xa0 In his hearing yesterday he kept referring to this --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Petraeus?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Petraeus, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 He kept referring to this enduring commitment that the U.S. is going to have in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So how does that square up with Obama saying that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be an endless war?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think if you looked at the full arc of Petraeus\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, and even on all the specific questions when he was drilled down on the July 2011 deadline, everybody is on the same page.\xc2\xa0 Petraeus said that he supported it.\xc2\xa0 He said that he will enforce it.\xc2\xa0 When July 2011 comes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to transition our forces out of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It will be conditions-based and we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at where we are at that moment and what\xe2\x80\x99s the most appropriate number of troops to start moving, but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 Nothing he said in his testimony suggested anything else.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An enduring commitment suggests a rather long-term commitment to Afghanistan beyond July 2011, even if we start drawing down at that point.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Our commitment here is to make sure that Afghanistan can take care of the safety and security of their people on their own.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working so hard on making sure that we meet or exceed recruitment and retainment numbers in the police force and in their military, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to do.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why on the civilian side they\xe2\x80\x99re working to help the local communities be sufficient without American forces.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the entire purpose of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nAnd our work will not be done until we are -- let me start that sentence a little differently.\xc2\xa0 Our focus here is making sure that they can defend themselves, that we root out al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and that we do all the things that we can to support them in that effort.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the President agree with Petraeus that this will be an enduring commitment?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not having seen the entire context of where he said that, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to that specifically.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to immigration for one second.\xc2\xa0 Why is -- you said that this is the moment to do it because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on on immigration.\xc2\xa0 But the conventional wisdom I think from the White House and everywhere else is that this is not likely to happen this year.\xc2\xa0 So why now, given all the stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s on Congress\xe2\x80\x99s plate and the White House\xe2\x80\x99s plate?\xc2\xa0 Why are you talking about this now?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s important right now.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important at the border.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for folks who are employing people all over the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue the President thinks is -- and the President thinks that right now, given the focus on it, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that he makes clear exactly where he stands on it.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been keeping an eye on the Blagojevich trial?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You bet.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 11:51 A.M.
