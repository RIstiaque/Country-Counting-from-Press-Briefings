EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Contacts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll never tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you see?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s that asking?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I was going to try to go for a run today, which is when I put in my contacts, but I had meetings scheduled instead, so here we go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that bit of irrelevant information, I will go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The administration yesterday condemned the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist unequivocally, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House can say just as unequivocally that Israel had nothing to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for any other country, Ben.\xc2\xa0 We had nothing to do with it.\xc2\xa0 This has been expressed by officials at a variety of levels of the U.S. government.\xc2\xa0 And we condemn the violence in Iran, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to -- you should not take from this anything except that we\xe2\x80\x99re not speaking for any other country when we make statements like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the condemnation -- I\xe2\x80\x99m correct in saying the condemnation from the White House extends to anybody behind it, any party, any country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the condemnation is pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 It is condemnation in and of itself of the act of violence in Iran.\xc2\xa0 But again, our statement about -- in response to accusations that there was American involvement is categorical.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t say either way whether --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak for any other country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President address the incident in his conversation with the Prime Minister?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we provided a readout to you -- has that gone out?\xc2\xa0 Yes -- of the President\xe2\x80\x99s call with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Part of their regular communications on bilateral and regional issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The subjects were many, including the Middle East peace process, developments in the region, including in Iran.\xc2\xa0 But I won\xe2\x80\x99t get more specific than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Cell phone rings.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was going to welcome Jake back.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What song is that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s Snoop Dogg, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Fantastic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, out of practice of putting it on silent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Actually, I kind of liked it.\xc2\xa0 But yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, but I wanted to ask you about the video -- allegedly of Marines desecrating the bodies of the Taliban fighters.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whether the President has seen that video and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a concern in the White House that this incident will give the military a black eye?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the I think quite strong statements or seen the strong statements from Secretary Panetta.\xc2\xa0 We find this -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the video and what it depicts is -- or what it apparently depicts is deplorable, reprehensible and unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 The alleged action is obviously under investigation.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, Secretary Panetta spoke with President Karzai about it.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not the President has actually seen the video.\xc2\xa0 He is certainly aware of it and shares in the sentiment expressed by Secretary Panetta.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, welcome back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you have a question for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d love to ask about the talks with the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s probably restricted what you can talk about.\xc2\xa0 But apparently the administration later last evening became a little bit more willing to talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 I thought in light of that you could maybe share what is the goal here.\xc2\xa0 How do talks with the Taliban jive with the continuing military effort against the Taliban?\xc2\xa0 And what would the overall message be to soldiers who, or families of soldiers, who -- I understand that you make peace with your enemies, not with your friends.\xc2\xa0 But what would the message be about that such reconciliation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think those are all very good questions.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position has been for a long time that we would support and participate in Afghan-led reconciliation initiatives as one key part of our overall strategy.\xc2\xa0 As you say, you have to have a political solution at some point.\xc2\xa0 And a political settlement is essential here.\xc2\xa0 But it coexists with our military campaign.\xc2\xa0 It is in fact our military campaign that has set the conditions for initial reconciliation discussions that we hope will begin taking place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to be clear, we will continue to energetically prosecute the military campaign as we pursue this political effort.\xc2\xa0 And our role in this is to build confidence-building measures, to bring about a set of confidence-building measures that would allow both Afghan parties, the government and the Taliban, to demonstrate their seriousness in pursuing the process and eventually begin negotiating.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the reconciliation process has to be between the Afghan government and the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 We are helping facilitate that, but we are supporting an Afghan-led process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the message to the families or the troops that have served there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The service that our men and women in uniform as well as our civilians have provided in Afghanistan has been exemplary and the sacrifice has been enormous.\xc2\xa0 And the whole point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda, al Qaeda being the reason why we sent forces to Afghanistan in the first place and to create breathing room, if you will, space for the Afghan government to be able to build up Afghan forces so that Afghan forces can take the security lead, which as enunciated in Lisbon will happen by the end of 2014, and ultimately, for that country to succeed in the process of reconciliation that allows for peace in that very troubled land.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But reconciliation, as you know, is contingent upon some very important criteria, including laying down arms, renouncing al Qaeda, abiding by the Afghan constitution, including its provisions for minority rights and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights.\xc2\xa0 So this is not -- it is not without conditions that this reconciliation process would take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- but the U.S. possible confidence -- the role that the U.S. might play in confidence-building measures may be the release of five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 I know that no decision has been made, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a possibility.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell the American people about these five Taliban and why the U.S. feels it\xe2\x80\x99s okay -- hypothetically, because it is being discussed -- why it might be acceptable to release them to the Afghan government or to release them to the Taliban?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of points.\xc2\xa0 One, as you point out, we have not decided to transfer any Taliban officials from Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Two, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position to discuss ongoing deliberations or individual detainees.\xc2\xa0 But our goal of closing Guantanamo is well established and widely understood.\xc2\xa0 In general, any decision to transfer a detainee from Guantanamo would be undertaken in accordance with U.S. law and in consultation with Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The process of transferring detainees out of Guantanamo Bay has been ongoing -- this is broadly and not specific to your question -- but has been ongoing for a long time and obviously predates this administration.\xc2\xa0 And each transfer is done, again, undertaken in accordance with U.S. law and in consultation with the Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go up and back here.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this morning the U.S. Chamber had a big event where leaders spoke about their policy positions, calling on the administration to pass Keystone as quickly as possible to create as many jobs as possible.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is a State Department-led process, as you know, Cheryl.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, as you know, the provision that extended the payroll tax cut put this artificial 60-day deadline, if you will, on the decision-making process, and State Department -- the State Department has been very clear that that does not allow for the kinds of reviews that are necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To underscore that point, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that not only has no route been identified by the company, but the state of Nebraska, which will now do their own assessment of whatever the proposed alternate route is, has made clear in recent reports that their own environmental assessment would take six to nine months.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make here is that there is a reason why this process has within it the duration required to properly review all the different aspects of a project like this and to weigh all the important criteria.\xc2\xa0 And to try to circumvent that process is, as we said at the time, counterproductive, we believe, to even the goals stated by those who insisted on trying to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having said that, I have no new information and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department about that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jessica.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you may know, Mitt Romney said to CBS in an interview yesterday that the attacks on Bain Capital and his business are a lot like -- are unfair given what the President has done in his effort to save General Motors and Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the general election, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be pointing out that the President took the reins at General Motors and Chrysler, closed factories, closed dealerships, laid off thousands and thousands of workers as he tried to save the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree that in the case of the auto industry, it was necessary for some people to lose their jobs in order to save these businesses?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, Jessica, as you know, is that the automobile industry in this country was heading over a cliff and would likely not have survived were it not for -- certainly not at its size and competitiveness -- were it not for the decision this President made, a decision which I believe certainly the candidate you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, but I believe all the candidates, for the Republican nomination, opposed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99d be delighted to recite to you, as I did the other day, the very impressive statistics about the revival of the American automobile industry, including the two major companies that this President acted to save, and in doing so insisted on the kinds of changes in those companies that would lead them to be more competitive and to have the kind of success that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been having of late.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think the discussions you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about are going on within the Republican primary process, which I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wade into from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree that it was necessary for some people to lose jobs in order to save the industry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what our action was designed to do and did do was prevent the elimination of up to a million jobs in the automobile industry and create a situation where that industry is now creating jobs again.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important story to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that similar to what Mitt Romney did at Bain Capital?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comparative to give to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that Governor Romney and all of the candidates for -- as far as I know, pretty sure of this -- all the candidates for the Republican nomination opposed the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to do what he did to save the automobile industry in this country, and that is certainly something that the President expects to debate when the time comes in the general election.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, in his speech the other night, Mitt Romney accused the President of playing the \xe2\x80\x9cpolitics of envy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that or want to address it in any way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that means.\xc2\xa0 This President is focused on providing opportunity and security to the middle class, a middle class that has been under great stress for years now, that saw its incomes stagnate or decline in the previous 10 years, even as those at the highest income levels saw their incomes grow substantially and their share of wealth in this country grow substantially.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he is eager for everyone to succeed, and he wants to help build an economy that rewards hard work, rewards responsibility, that holds people accountable, and that insists that folks on -- in all the different parts of our economy and on all levels of the economic ladder play by the same rules.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why Wall Street reform was so important.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why appointing and installing Richard Cordray as our consumer watchdog was so important, because Wall Street needs to play by the same rules as Main Street.\xc2\xa0 And then the opportunity for everyone to succeed becomes far greater, and that\xe2\x80\x99s his approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back a week or so ago to the Defense Authorization Act.\xc2\xa0 When the President signed it he issued a very strong statement saying he would never carry out the provisions that would allow him to -- allow any President to detain an American indefinitely without a trial.\xc2\xa0 My question is, does the President intend to challenge that in any way and try to get that off the books, or leave that for some future President to exercise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would refer you to statements I made and others made about that at the time, when the President signed the bill into law.\xc2\xa0 And our concerns about that provision within the defense authorization bill were well known as it was being developed in our consultations with the authors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of those concerns were addressed, and addressed to the point where the President felt he could sign the bill because of its importance overall.\xc2\xa0 And then, as you state, our approach to this has been further clarified and illuminated, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can improve upon what was said in the signing statement or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it does mean that the power will continue, the potential for that will continue for whoever the next President is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, as you know, is focused on making sure that the law is implemented in a way that maintains the flexibility that our forces need to do their jobs and protect this country and protect American citizens -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say about future actions we might take legislatively or otherwise.\xc2\xa0 I would just to point you to what he has said and I have said and what others have said about implementation of this law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Jay.\xc2\xa0 This is the two-year anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti.\xc2\xa0 What tangible results has this administration seen since giving funding for that country that\xe2\x80\x99s still devastated?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is, as you note, the two-year anniversary, and the earthquake and the damage that was done was indeed devastating.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that there are signs of progress and promise in Haiti.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The significant portion of the rubble has been cleared.\xc2\xa0 A large portion or majority of the folks who were living in tents and similar-type housing have been located into better places.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I can give you more detail about the actions that this administration took, that this President took immediately, including establishing the -- I believe it was the Clinton-Bush Fund in reaction to Haiti.\xc2\xa0 And we remain committed to Haiti and to its recovery from that terrible earthquake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you say this administration remains committed, before the earthquake Haiti was considered the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 And many people have had guesstimates saying that it would take more than a decade, decades even, to make it -- just to come back to where it was.\xc2\xa0 Where is the guesstimate now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, those guesstimates were right outside of the earthquake.\xc2\xa0 What are the guesstimates now?\xc2\xa0 How long does this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent question and I simply don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer.\xc2\xa0 I can research it for you, or perhaps State might have -- the State Department might have more details.\xc2\xa0 But the -- I mean, that country\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult history obviously predates the terrible earthquake, and the earthquake did that country no favors.\xc2\xa0 And the hardship there is well known and extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working very hard to assist Haitians in this very difficult time over the last two years.\xc2\xa0 And again, progress has been made but circumstances there remain very challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in your comments on the Marine video, did you intend to suggest that it may not be what it appears to be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a legal matter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t pass pronouncements.\xc2\xa0 I think that the activity is alleged and what\xe2\x80\x99s seen in the video is apparent.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to from here go beyond that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- what is apparently occurring in that video is deplorable and does not live up to the very high standards set for the United States Marines or broadly the United States military.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any suggestion that it\xe2\x80\x99s not genuine?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter under investigation and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pass judgment, a legal judgment from here except to say that the apparent activity -- the activity that\xe2\x80\x99s apparent in that video is truly regrettable and deplorable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Cheryl\xe2\x80\x99s question about Keystone, are you saying the President might be moving toward a statement where he blocks Keystone under the law, which he has to do by February 21st?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the process for Keystone, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on so many occasions from here, is conducted at the State Department on behalf of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 And the State Department has been clear about the time necessary to assess any alternate route.\xc2\xa0 That route hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even been identified yet, as I said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the company and the state of Nebraska has said it needs six to nine months for the environmental assessment to be done after that route is identified.\xc2\xa0 So I cite those facts because it goes straight to the point about the very political and arbitrary action taken by some folks in Congress, by Republicans in Congress, to try to play political games with the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 We said it was a bad idea at the time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea for a bunch of reasons, including the ones I just laid out.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcement to make about action that the State Department might take or the President might take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99ll take action by the deadline in the bill that he signed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He signed a bill into law, so I would refer you to the State Department about how that will be taken under consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Matt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To keep you rolling on Keystone, some Republicans in Congress are working on a plan for legislation they say would force the issuing of a permit for Keystone, effectively bypassing the President or overruling the President if he fails to take action by February 21st.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration see this is as a legitimate course of action?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s several layers of speculation about legislation that may or may not be written, that may or may not be submitted, that may or may not be voted on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to deal with the facts as we know them, which is that this is a process that long predates this administration that has a review like this conducted out of the State Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The timeframe for something like this is well established based on the kinds of procedures that need to be considered, the criteria that need to be weighed in a decision-making process like this.\xc2\xa0 The decision to seek an alternate route necessitated a delay of the decision-making process so that route could be identified and then assessed.\xc2\xa0 And the State Department is overseeing that process now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two subjects -- one, on the insourcing event yesterday, the President was obviously very critical of outsourcing.\xc2\xa0 Why then does he have Jeff Immelt of GE, who has been accused of a lot of outsourcing, as the head of his Jobs Council?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President had that event yesterday because there is a mighty important trend underway globally that greatly affects the American economy and American workers.\xc2\xa0 And it is a very welcome trend and it is one that this President believes we need to enhance to ensure that the trend continues, which is American businesses making judgments about where to best invest and to hire workers are increasingly deciding that that place is here in the United States of America -- not abroad, not in China.\xc2\xa0 The statistics are pretty overwhelming and very impressive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And your viewers, everyone here has -- the audiences that you reach have been reading and seeing and hearing reports about outsourcing of American jobs for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because that process did happen and has happened.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important reversal of that trend that\xe2\x80\x99s underway here.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President had the event that he had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we have global companies that are American.\xc2\xa0 We have companies that do business around the world, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, too.\xc2\xa0 Now we want to focus attention on and increase the likelihood that American businesses will choose to invest here, but we also want our businesses to compete globally.\xc2\xa0 So they do not cancel each other out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Taliban, what did the Vice President mean a few weeks ago when he told Newsweek that the Taliban per se is not our enemy?\xc2\xa0 Was that a way to try to get the Taliban to the table by saying you\xe2\x80\x99re no longer the enemy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, which I remember answering at the time very clearly, which is the United States of America did not send military forces under George W. Bush to Afghanistan because the Taliban was in power.\xc2\xa0 The Taliban had been in power.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. invaded Afghanistan because attacks were launched against the United States by al Qaeda, located in Afghanistan, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we went in.\xc2\xa0 His point is that there is not -- our number-one objective, as I just stated, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan policy is to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus on that goal has been clear to the American people now for quite some time both in the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken in Afghanistan specifically and in the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken in terms of taking the fight to al Qaeda, most memorably by the decision he made to remove Osama bin Laden from the battlefield.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What remains true, as I was saying earlier in answer to Jake\xe2\x80\x99s questions, is that peace in Afghanistan will come through reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 There has to be a political settlement.\xc2\xa0 That has been the policy for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Reconciliation of the Taliban is conditional and it would require any Taliban soldier or official to renounce the use of violence, promise allegiance to the Afghan constitution, disavow al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 But there needs to be a political settlement for all the reasons that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, our military action -- the heroics of our military forces -- have helped create the conditions that allow for the possibility of negotiations to begin and we will not let up in that effort.\xc2\xa0 So I think that is a fuller explanation of what the Vice President was talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Welcome back.\xc2\xa0 Everybody is back now.\xc2\xa0 Did something happen?\xc2\xa0 Is there a lull in the action or something?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to follow up on Iran.\xc2\xa0 What is the stated U.S. policy when it comes to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to gain this nuclear technology?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The administration is committed to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that covert action would be on the table?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss those kinds of things from here.\xc2\xa0 But we have a policy that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on working with our international partners collectively and then, obviously, unilaterally to put pressure on Iran to abide by its international obligations, to come clean about its nuclear ambitions.\xc2\xa0 We have provided numerous opportunities for the Iranian government to act on the international community\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to get right by their obligations.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to take action to add pressure, increase their isolation until they make the right call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can say definitively that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the policy of the United States to covertly assassinate people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I -<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or be involved in some sort of attempt like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that we deplore the violence, deplore the action --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This violence?\xc2\xa0 Or the violence of all of the assassinations --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of U.S. policy in terms of the kind of action that you talk about, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not about to revise that from here.\xc2\xa0 This comes up in relation to a specific incident that we have made clear that we had nothing to do with.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve rejected those accusations.\xc2\xa0 We are engaged in an effort to try to pressure Iran to live up to its obligations, to give up its nuclear ambitions -- nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to engage in that effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you about retaliation?\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. government concerned about retaliation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been categorical and clear about the fact that we were not involved in the death of this individual.\xc2\xa0 Our concern about Iranian behavior is ever present.\xc2\xa0 And we are very vigilant and mindful of various threats that can be -- that are made, whether they involve the Straits of Hormuz or other areas or issues.\xc2\xa0 So -- but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific level of concern to convey to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Iran decides to retaliate on Israel in a military way, U.S. response would be what?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are absolutely committed to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, as we made clear again today in our readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s phone conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what we might do if some action were taken by another country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any concern, by the way, of making that readout public, because it might feed the conspiracy theorists in Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any secret to the fact that we have an important and ongoing relationship with Israel.\xc2\xa0 We have many important issues to discuss with the Israeli government.\xc2\xa0 The President has many important matters to raise with Prime Minister Netanyahu and vice versa.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- those conversations are regular and ongoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one final question.\xc2\xa0 Any reason why you kept cameras away from the President visiting his campaign reelection headquarters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was an OTR.\xc2\xa0 I think it was a brief -- a brief drop-by.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys love when we cover OTRs at delis, at barbeque restaurants.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Campaign reelection headquarters, that\xe2\x80\x99s not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- on the fly and brief.\xc2\xa0 The President was very gratified to have the opportunity.\xc2\xa0 I think it underscores the point I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to make from here in answer to questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign, which is that he is here in Washington focused on doing his job as President.\xc2\xa0 He is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you weren\xe2\x80\x99t concerned that pictures of this would make it look otherwise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, he obviously had campaign events last night in Chicago that you all covered.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re not hiding the fact that he is engaged in some campaign activities.\xc2\xa0 But as a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A little bit.\xc2\xa0 You try to minimize it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I try and tell you -- give you the facts, which is, the fact is, the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign isn\xe2\x80\x99t across the river in Rosslyn, isn\xe2\x80\x99t in Washington.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in Chicago, halfway across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that reflects the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s point is that if he makes a rare visit to his campaign headquarters --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we can debate campaign access.\xc2\xa0 We made clear that he went there.\xc2\xa0 We made clear that he -- you guys come into his -- pools come into his -- when he speaks at these campaign events and will continue to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We release, the campaign releases information about its campaign goals.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously -- there is a robust effort underway, based in Chicago, to ensure that this President is reelected so that he can continue to take action to help the American economy grow, to help it create jobs, to protect the middle class and protect the country as a matter of national security.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not at all shy about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me move around.\xc2\xa0 Julia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Up and back, as I do a lot.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I saw the Department of Justice memo that they okayed the appointment during recess of Richard Cordray, but the date was January 6th, it looks like it came to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Cordray was appointed on the 4th, so then does that mean that the decision was made without the approval of the Department of Justice?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the opinion was rendered verbally prior to the date of the opinion itself.\xc2\xa0 The opinion was based on the advice provided by OLC, and it is very standard for -- especially a long -- as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the lengthy opinion that was put out, for those things to be developed over a period of time.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- the timeframe for this is very similar to, in my understanding, to previous occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the decision was -- the opinion was rendered before the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Verbally.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- decision made by the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking to Roger.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s military exercises underway between Israel and the United States.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details?\xc2\xa0 Is that part of a warning to Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the situation with the American who\xe2\x80\x99s under arrest and accused of spying in Iran?\xc2\xa0 Anything new on his --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to this a few times earlier this week with regard to the absolutely invalid accusations and sentence levied against him.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we call on him to be released immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, on talks with the Taliban, are you pressing the Taliban to change their attitude toward women?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, Connie, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear today and on many occasions that reconciliation is contingent upon members of the Taliban laying down their arms, renouncing allegiance to al Qaeda, and abiding by the Afghan constitution, which includes provisions protecting the rights of women.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow up on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get to Roger, then you, John.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you had an update on when the debt ceiling request is going to the Hill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Days, not weeks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That was true a couple of days ago, and it remains true.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more specific for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s imminent?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in that it\xe2\x80\x99s not weeks, it\xe2\x80\x99s imminent.\xc2\xa0 But when we have something more specific we\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of Asian leaders who are going to be visiting the Gulf region -- Saudi Arabia, China\xe2\x80\x99s Premier going there, and South Korean Prime Minister going as well to the region.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the progress that Geithner has made in terms of trying to get the oil issue resolved in Beijing?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some progress with Japan apparently, but what about the Chinese position at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pleased with the progress that has been made.\xc2\xa0 You noted Japan; I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting Europe.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing to have discussions with other partners and allies around the world about the need to continue to put pressure on Iran so that it ceases its -- to behave outside of its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 That process is ongoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be meeting with Geithner?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be meeting with Geithner?\xc2\xa0 How soon will they talk about what was accomplished on that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cHe,\xe2\x80\x9d being the President?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when Tim returns, but Secretary Geithner is in these hallways quite frequently and sees the President quite often.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific meeting to announce.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding the reconciliation process.\xc2\xa0 Has this administration been in contact or discussions with its allies, including Great Britain, regarding this process?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am sure that we are in consultation with all the ISAF countries and with all our allies on this matter.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific to impart to you about that, but you can be sure, since this effort is an international effort, that we are consulting with and engaging with our allies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you back there.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you confirm that the President plans to reprise his deficit reduction plans, which he first mapped out in September as a part of his 2013 budget proposal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal, nor do I want to get ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address, but it is certainly fair to say that the approach the President laid out in September, a balanced approach to comprehensive deficit reduction, reflects how he believes we need to move going forward.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- without getting into specifics about the budget, that approach is the one he still believes needs to be taken, and he would very happily endorse a decision by Congress to take up that approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The process that was put in place by the Budget Control Act that created the super committee that created the sequestration remains in place, minus the super committee.\xc2\xa0 In other words, the sequester is designed not to happen.\xc2\xa0 It is designed to be a forcing mechanism to force Congress to take action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it is simply incontrovertible that the only viable approach to comprehensive deficit reduction, viable both economically and certainly politically, is a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that has been endorsed by bipartisan commissions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that at least some Republicans have said they support, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the approach that this President and the overwhelming majority of the American people support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we would greatly endorse a decision by congressional leaders, in particular Republicans, to take this approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why consider reprising a plan that\xe2\x80\x99s already been rejected?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not how this works, though.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you put forward -- first of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting into the specifics about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the budget.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s -- there is no other alternative here than a balanced approach to bipartisan deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the specifics of how that were to work if Congress, in its wisdom, were to take it up and Republican leaders were to allow it to proceed, then the details would be negotiated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But balance is essential so that no sector of American society has to bear the burden by itself, or unduly, of reducing our deficit and getting our fiscal house in order for the long term.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that has to be taken.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully it will be taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Jay, going back to the insourcing event quickly, the President announced that he plans to put forward new tax proposals to reward companies that choose to invest or bring back jobs to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what those proposals might look like, and will they be a part of the budget?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of anything we might be announcing in the future.\xc2\xa0 I think that what the President was expressing is his overall goal and intention of doing what he can to make sure this trend continues and to strengthen it, to bring -- to make it even more worthwhile for companies to invest in the United States and to hire here in the United States and build our economy and build jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because there are some fascinating facts about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening out there and the assessments that are being made by companies about not just the labor cost, but the overall cost and efficiency comparisons that are being made about whether or not to locate a factory, if you will, overseas in China or somewhere else, versus locating it here in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And increasingly, businesses are making the judgment that the over -- and these are clear-eyed, bottom-line-minded businessmen and businesswomen who are making the judgment that it is a good time to locate those factories and jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a trend the President wants to strengthen and encourage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then Paula.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you had it up.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll go Mike, Paula, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get out of here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to get back to the DOJ memo.\xc2\xa0 And in it they acknowledged that this was a novel area and that it possibly could lead to some litigation.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons for the appointment that was given by the White House was that there was concern without a director in place the bureau would never be able to exercise all of its authorities.\xc2\xa0 But why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you concerned that this litigation might not hamper all of its efforts if they end up in court?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because we believe our legal argument is very strong, will absolutely pass muster.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that, hypothetically, there might be a legal challenge to it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mitigate against the fact that Richard Cordray is the consumer watchdog; he is in place making sure that Americans are protected from payday lenders and non-bank financial institutions and student loan brokers and others, from the abuses that they were not protected against prior to him being installed by the President and recess appointed by the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the absolute necessity of doing this remains as clear today as it was when he did it and prior to him doing it.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the American people by and large -- in fact overwhelmingly -- support the existence of somebody here in Washington looking out for them; making sure that the institutions that have very well-paid lobbyists, armies of them here looking out for their interests, have somebody else to deal with here in Washington looking out for the interests of regular Americans in their financial dealings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the administration ready for those fights when they do come?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just refer you to the OLC memo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Paula.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the law says -- sorry, the memo says that the President has appointed him, but the memo does not address the underlying question of whether a recess appointment is the same as a confirmation.\xc2\xa0 Because the 2010 law that established the bureau said the new powers come to an appointee who is confirmed.\xc2\xa0 Is the President saying his recess appointment is legally the same as a confirmation by the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is saying that in recess appointing Richard Cordray, Richard Cordray has absolutely the powers he needs to fulfill his responsibilities in that job.\xc2\xa0 And there have been a number of rather enlightening instances in the past 24 hours of confirmation by unusual sources of the fact that the House and Senate are indeed in recess.\xc2\xa0 In the very press release put out by a Republican congresswoman arguing against the recess appointment, she acknowledged that the Senate was in recess.\xc2\xa0 I believe on the House Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s website today it said the House was not in recess -- I mean, not in session.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So look, anybody who doubts this, any American who doubts that this is a recess appointment, should, through you, take a look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on Capitol Hill and argue to -- and have Congress argue that they\xe2\x80\x99re in session, they\xe2\x80\x99re doing their jobs on Capitol Hill, when in fact they\xe2\x80\x99re not even around.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Paula.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The insourcing tax proposals, is it possible that this could be coming out as part of the overall corporate tax reform?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want you to repeat that so I make sure I get it right.\xc2\xa0 Say that again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The insourcing proposals that are to be coming out, is it possible that they may be coming out as part of the overall reform of the corporate tax system?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make about that kind of issue.\xc2\xa0 Urge you to stay very focused on what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here -- State of the Union address is coming up, the release of the budget is coming up.\xc2\xa0 Lots of really interesting things to cover.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the state of the union?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good?\xc2\xa0 Strong?\xc2\xa0 Very strong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the wording that\xe2\x80\x99s in the draft already?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No!\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:26 P.M.
