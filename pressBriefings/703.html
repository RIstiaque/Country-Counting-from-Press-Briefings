CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Thank you for being here, as ever. \xc2\xa0Before I take your questions I wanted to have you notice, if you haven\'t already, the stories this morning about a data release by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, data on pricing for 3,300 hospitals. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd as you may know, the Affordable Care Act requires all hospitals to establish and make public their standard charges for items and services. \xc2\xa0And today\xe2\x80\x99s data release by CMS is one step towards putting people and families in charge of their own health care. \xc2\xa0By making this data available we are allowing everyone to see the huge pricing variations from hospital to hospital for the same procedures, sometimes from one hospital that\'s just in the next neighborhood over to another. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith me today is Todd Park, Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer, and Todd can say a few words about how the Affordable Care Act is driving this data accessibility and how the data is an important step towards improving pricing and care for consumers. \xc2\xa0It is a question that I think consumers, justifiably, ask -- why am I paying at hospital X three times -- or why is that hospital charging three times more for the same service that a hospital in the next town over may be charging? \xc2\xa0And providing this data to the public allows for consumers to know the facts and empowers them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd with that, I will turn it over to Todd. \xc2\xa0If you could, hear what he has to say, direct questions on his topic area to him at the top, and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll step aside and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions on other issues.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, what\xe2\x80\x99s Todd\xe2\x80\x99s title? \xc2\xa0I\'m sorry -- what\xe2\x80\x99s your title?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Todd is Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0Hello, everybody. \xc2\xa0Today, CMS is releasing new data on hospital charges, as Jay was just describing -- what hospitals charge for in-patient services associated with the hundred most common kinds of hospital stays. \xc2\xa0The data show a huge variation in charges from hospital to hospital, including those within the same community. \xc2\xa0And hospitals determine what they\xe2\x80\x99ll charge for items or services provided to patients and these charges are the amounts that the hospital then bills for an item or service.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs a note, these charges are the starting point for how much hospitals get paid. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately paid depends on whether the patient is insured and who the insurer is. \xc2\xa0Patients who are uninsured or underinsured could be asked to pay these full charges.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBy making this data available we\'re allowing everyone to see huge variations in hospital charges across the country. \xc2\xa0For example, the map behind me illustrates average in-patient hospital charges for hip and knee replacements across the country. \xc2\xa0Average in-patient charges for hip and knee replacements can vary from $5,300 on average at a hospital in Ada, Oklahoma, to a high of $223,000 at a hospital in Monterrey Park, California. \xc2\xa0So you can see on the map how average charges by region vary enormously. \xc2\xa0But even within a given metro area, there is big variation. For example, in Birmingham, Alabama, the average hospital charge for hip and knee replacement varies from $23,000 at one hospital to $141,000 at another.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo today CMS is making this massive hospital charges data set publicly available and downloadable by anybody. \xc2\xa0And if our experience with other open data efforts is any guide, innovators and entrepreneurs will take this data and use it to power consumer-friendly apps that can help folks across the country make the health care decisions that work best for them. \xc2\xa0Researchers, analysts and journalists will comb through the data and bring you insight as to why this kind of charge variation is happening. \xc2\xa0The marketplace will become more transparent. \xc2\xa0And the American public will benefit. \xc2\xa0It\'s another example of how the Affordable Care Act is advancing transparency, innovation, and putting consumers in charge of their own health care.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd with that, let\'s open it up for questions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Any questions for Todd? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Beyond this information out there, is there any move on the administration\'s part -- do you feel like there needs to be any changes in the law to address these vast disparities?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0So there are a couple things actually happening \xc2\xa0-- and I\'d refer you to CMS for more detailed info -- but we\'re also announcing today $87 million in grants to establish and fund our research centers across the country operated by state governments that actually take our data and other data and do research into price variation, and make prices transparent and help make the marketplace more transparent and competitive. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAlso, there is work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done by CMS around trying to help folks who actually need financial assistance not be subjected to these massive charges, but charges more along the lines of what Medicare actually pays or what folks who are insured actually pay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you publishing or can you publish the different rates paid by Medicaid, Medicare for these services, and the rates paid by the insurance companies?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0So we can publish the data that we\'ve got. \xc2\xa0And actually, the data set that we\'ve released includes both the hospitals\xe2\x80\x99 bill charges and what Medicare pays for each of these services across the country, by hospital.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But private insurance?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0We actually don\xe2\x80\x99t have that data in-house. \xc2\xa0But these state government operated price and research centers in a lot of cases will have access to that kind of data potentially and be able to do work in that area.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And, Todd, a variation to his question -- in terms of driving the cost down, do you think by publishing this -- when you say transparent, does that -- some people would be shamed into lowering their prices? \xc2\xa0Are there parts of the President\'s law that you contend will actually help lower some of these prices so it becomes more fair? \xc2\xa0I\'m trying to understand -- after the transparency, how do you think it drives costs down?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0So the history of marketplaces is that transparent marketplaces are more competitive, and more competitive marketplaces drive down costs. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the hope here. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\'s a variation on that. \xc2\xa0So if you\'re insured, are you shielded from these vast differences? \xc2\xa0I mean, if your knee replacement is going to be covered anyway, does it -- \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0So these charges actually, again, are a starting point for the prices ultimately paid to hospitals. \xc2\xa0So if you have insurance, you have a negotiated rate, typically, that is lower than these charges. \xc2\xa0And you\'ll see the Medicare payment is obviously a lot lower than these charges. \xc2\xa0But even if you actually have insurance, in a lot of cases the insurance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily protect you from the charges. \xc2\xa0It will actually cover some chunk of them, but then you\'re subject to the rest, again, depending upon the insurance that you have. \xc2\xa0And even if you actually have the kind of insurance where the negotiated rate is actually kind of your full exposure, the charges that we published today are frequently the starting point for negotiating those rates and so it\xe2\x80\x99s super relevant for those situations as well.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Mark, and then April.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Todd, is it your assumption that a hospital that charges $5,300 for a surgery provides the same level of quality as one that charges $223,000 for the same operation?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0So these are questions that we are really excited to see you guys investigate and check out. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And actually to help you out, CMS has also previously made hospital quality data downloadable for virtually every American hospital as well -- the Hospitalcompare data set with a vast number of quality metrics for these hospitals. \xc2\xa0So check that out. \xc2\xa0Check this data out, match it up, and see what you can come up with.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How would you even go about doing that? \xc2\xa0I mean, assessing the quality of the service?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0So there are a variety of metrics actually that have been developed by public-private collaborations over the years, and these metrics are then generated based on a whole variety of data and reported by hospitals. \xc2\xa0And so go to <a href="mailto:hospitalcompare@CMS">hospitalcompare@CMS</a> to learn more. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s really, really cool stuff. \xc2\xa0And I think looking at that data and looking at this data and the combination is going to be really interesting.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0April.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Following up on what Mark was saying, do you think that this could be a disadvantage for some hospitals as you\xe2\x80\x99re putting out quality of care ratio and the cost versus another hospital in the area?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0I think as a fundamental principle we believe that the marketplace should be transparent and that it\xe2\x80\x99s a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s right to know what these prices are and what the quality levels are. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we made this data available to everybody.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, there will be lots of researchers and analysts and innovators that take this data and come up with insights and come up with tools that help people act upon the data. \xc2\xa0But as a fundamental principle, we think this data needs to be out there in the open and that makes for a better, more functional, more competitive health care marketplace who does the right thing by the American public.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it might not necessarily drive down costs? \xc2\xa0It would make those who have the better quality care keep their prices, and maybe even go even higher, do you think? \xc2\xa0I think it could be the opposite of what you intend it to do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0I think, in general, and again just from borrowing lessons learned from other marketplaces, when you actually make quality and cost and value transparent, that added level of transparency and competition does actually, net/net, produce better results for consumers. \xc2\xa0And I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s actually very likely to happen here.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Victoria.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In seeing some of these big discrepancies for the same operations, say, in the same town, did you look at taking it to the set where you could see, is it anesthetic, is it the actual operation, is it the time in the -- is it the hospital stay -- did you see that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0So the data we\xe2\x80\x99ve released is actually on the state overall and in-patient service actually bundled with it. We\xe2\x80\x99re actually looking at potential additional steps, looking, for example, at out-patient services as well. \xc2\xa0But for detailed questions I would refer you to CMS.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do they have it? \xc2\xa0They have that breakdown?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0They have the underlying claims that they\xe2\x80\x99ve used to then -- right.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any message for U.S. citizens who do medical tours and go out of the country to get their medical procedures accomplished?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, say it one more time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any message for Americans who go out of America and go to other countries to get their surgical procedures -- it\xe2\x80\x99s much cheaper in other countries.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any comment on medical tourism, but what I will say is that it\'s going to be incredibly helpful I think to consumers to have an increasing amount of information available about the charges, the pricing, the quality of health care here. \xc2\xa0And that will help them make better decisions for them and their families.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Bill.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What is the connection between what the hospital charges, no matter what it is, and what you\'re willing to pay under Medicare or Medicaid?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0As you\'ll see, Medicare across the board pays a much, much, much lower rate than charges. \xc2\xa0And so Medicare is getting a great deal for Medicare beneficiaries. \xc2\xa0The variation is massive in terms of the multiple on what Medicare pays. \xc2\xa0And it\'s a really good question as to why that is. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just so I understand, no matter what the hospital charges, Medicare says, this is what we\'re going to pay, period.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0Correct. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s right. \xc2\xa0And why there is that huge gap, you\'ll figure out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Slightly related -- since you\'re here -- yesterday some of us reported that the White House is hiring a new Internet and privacy advisor, who I think is someone who is going to work with you. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us a little bit more about that position, what gap it fills?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing personnel situation. \xc2\xa0I can\'t comment on that right now. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0All right, Todd.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You could be a spokesman. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0You\'re good, man. \xc2\xa0I just trained him for 10 minutes. \xc2\xa0Look at that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. PARK: \xc2\xa0Thank you for your interest. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Take good care. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0In answer to some of the questions about how we can sort of process this information that Todd was talking about in data and make assessments about it, there was -- and he referred to journalism as a tool to doing that -- there was an excellent article that my former employer, Time Magazine did, Stephen Brill, that went at length into this subject a number of months ago. \xc2\xa0It\'s a good read.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith that, I\'ll go to your other questions. \xc2\xa0Nedra.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a couple topics -- first, on Syria, Secretary Kerry said yesterday it was up to the Syrian people whether Assad should go. \xc2\xa0And I just wonder if that indicates any change in administrative position on Assad\'s future. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0Our position is that Syria\'s future cannot include Bashar al-Assad. \xc2\xa0But we have also been clear, in addition to making our views known that Assad has lost all legitimacy and must step aside, that the Syrian people must negotiate the makeup of a transition governing body and determine which elements of the regime they would be willing to work with in that transition governing body. \xc2\xa0But in terms of our views on Syria\'s future, it is a post-Assad future. \xc2\xa0Assad himself has given up all rights to represent the Syrian people. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the language that Secretary Kerry used, is that something that was appropriate, or does it maybe send a mixed signal? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think he was making the point that we\'ve made all along that it is our view and it is our position that Assad cannot be the leader of Syria in the future and that he must step aside. \xc2\xa0That is the view of the Syrian people as well. \xc2\xa0We have also made clear that the decisions about how that transition takes place and who participates in it is something for the Syrian people to decide. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo that has always been our position, and the two statements are compatible. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, obviously, the Syrian people decide and the opposition decides who will be -- there has to be a negotiated process, but the Syrian people decide who will be represented from the regime in a transition governing body.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another topic -- the rescue of these three women in Ohio that had been -- were kidnapped for a decade or more -- has the President been updated on that situation? \xc2\xa0Is he following it closely? \xc2\xa0And is there any sort of response that he had?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific response from the President. \xc2\xa0I think it would be impossible to read or watch the news and not be aware of this extraordinary story, so I\'m confident that he knows about it and knows about this tremendous development that these women who have been missing for so long have been found and returned to their families. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a great thing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But he\'s not getting any official briefings on it or anything.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of, no. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This morning, Senator McConnell gave a pretty tough speech about what he argued are red flags about the nomination of Tom Perez, and I think that just before the briefing started, Republicans invoked a rule -- procedural rule that prevents the committee from dealing with his nomination today. \xc2\xa0And I guess I\'m wondering if the White House has any response to Senator McConnell\'s arguments, and how concerned the White House is that his arguments and these procedural moves today, what impact those ultimately will have on the nomination, whether you anticipated a lengthy delay or ultimately a block of it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I appreciate the question, because it is unfortunate that some Republicans on the Hill are politicizing this nomination. \xc2\xa0But the bottom line is that Tom Perez is a dedicated public servant who has spent his career fighting to keep the American Dream within reach for hardworking, middle-class families and those striving to get into the middle class. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe expect the Senate to move forward on his nomination, through committee and on to the floor. \xc2\xa0He is enormously qualified. \xc2\xa0He\'s known as a pragmatic leader and a consensus-builder. \xc2\xa0He has served as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, and, as you know, served as the Secretary of Maryland\'s Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, and has a long and distinguished record. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd opposition to or throwing up roadblocks to his nomination is part of an unfortunate process of politicization of these nominees that does not serve the American people well, certainly does not serve, in this case, the work that the Department of Labor needs to do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Senator McConnell\'s arguments are substantive, you\'re saying that they\'re politicized? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you concerned that this will mean that his nomination does not ultimately move forward?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, we believe that the Senate will move forward on the nomination -- should move forward on the nomination. \xc2\xa0He is enormously qualified, and there has not been a case made that is not political and partisan against his nomination. \xc2\xa0And we hope and expect the Senate will move forward. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another note -- does the President support this effort -- there\'s been reports about this effort by the FBI to change laws to make it easier to wiretap Internet-based phone services. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Yes, I do have something on that. \xc2\xa0The so-called going dark issue and how best to ensure that our law enforcement and legal authorities keep pace with technological advancements have been under discussion for some time. \xc2\xa0And the Department of Justice is working with other agencies on a way forward that protects the privacy of Americans, preserves corporate innovation, and provides the tools that our law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals require. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to announce on this. \xc2\xa0DOJ is working on this with other agencies, and I would refer you to the Department of Justice.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJon.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, in advance of today\xe2\x80\x99s hearing on Benghazi, Senator Lindsey Graham said, I think the dam is about to break on Benghazi. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to find people asleep at the switch when it comes to the State Department, including Hillary Clinton. \xc2\xa0What do you say to this allegation from top Republicans that Hillary Clinton was asleep at the switch?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0This administration has made extraordinary efforts to work with five different congressional committees investigating what happened before, during, and after the Benghazi attacks, including, over the past eight months, testifying in 10 congressional hearings, holding 20 staff briefings, and providing over 25,000 pages of documents. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnother leading Senate Republican, Senator Corker, said today that he feels like he knows what happened in Benghazi and he is, \xe2\x80\x9cfairly satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And as The New York Times reported this morning, much of what the witnesses were expected to raise in the hearings today has already been addressed both in hearings and in the Accountability Review Board report. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI mean this is a subject that has, from its beginning, been subject to attempts to politicize it by Republicans, when, in fact, what happened in Benghazi was a tragedy. \xc2\xa0And the President has been committed from day one to two things -- making sure that those who are responsible for the deaths of four Americans are found and brought to justice, and that we do everything we need to do to ensure that this kind of attack cannot happen again. \xc2\xa0And the standing up of the Accountability Review Board by then-Secretary Clinton, with the full support of the President, demonstrates the seriousness with which she took this issue. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThat review board issued a report that was unsparing and highly critical in some areas, and was led by two highly respected nonpartisan experts in the field of national security, Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Pickering. \xc2\xa0And that report issued contained within it a series of recommendations, every single one of which has been acted on or is being acted on by the State Department. \xc2\xa0And I think, again, that demonstrates the seriousness with which we took the true issues here. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIt also, given the remarkable level of cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated with congressional committees and investigators thus far, demonstrates again that we\xe2\x80\x99re at a place where there are attempts to politicize this when that should not be the case.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re going after Hillary Clinton?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that they are. \xc2\xa0I will note that in the report issued by the committee, Chairman Issa\xe2\x80\x99s committee -- which was, again -- deliberately excluded Democrats, was highly partisan -- it included a main allegation within it that was described by The Washington Post Factchecker this way: \xe2\x80\x9cIssa has no basis or evidence to show that Clinton [then-Secretary Clinton] had anything to do with this cable any more than she personally approved a cable on proper email etiquette. \xc2\xa0The odds are extremely long that Secretary Clinton ever saw or approved this memo, giving us confidence that his inflammatory and reckless language qualifies as a whopper\xe2\x80\x9d -- that would be Chairman Issa\xe2\x80\x99s language.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the White House is confident that Hillary Clinton acted appropriately throughout this process?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We are. \xc2\xa0And I think I would point you to the Accountability Review Board and what --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Which didn\xe2\x80\x99t --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think I would point you to the report the put out. \xc2\xa0I would point you to what the two heads of that board, Ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen -- each highly praised by both sides of the aisle for their long, distinguished careers -- put out in a statement this week: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning of the ARB process, we had unfettered access to everyone and everything, including all of the documentation we needed. \xc2\xa0Our marching orders were to get to the bottom of what happened, and that is what we did.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAgain, this is an unsparing report done by two career professionals, nonpartisan career professionals, that contain within it very serious recommendations, found shortcomings that needed to be corrected, and the State Department acted immediately on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I wanted to ask you also about something you said on November 28th. \xc2\xa0You said that the talking points that were prepared for Ambassador Rice and the administration were given, as you pointed out at the time to the Hill, were compiled, written up by the intelligence community -- that there was no change that was asked for by the White House or by the State Department except for a single word. \xc2\xa0But now the Weekly Standard has obtained three revisions to these talking points that show substantial changes that were done and asked for specifically by the State Department. \xc2\xa0Were you incorrect when you said that only a single word had been changed?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, I was not. \xc2\xa0I think what remains the case is that the intelligence community, CIA, drafted these talking points and redrafted these talking points. \xc2\xa0The fact that there are inputs is always the case in a process like this. \xc2\xa0But the only edits made by anyone here at the White House were stylistic and non-substantive. \xc2\xa0They corrected the description of the building or the facility in Benghazi from \xe2\x80\x9cconsulate\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomatic facility\xe2\x80\x9d and the like. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd ultimately, this all has been discussed and reviewed and provided in enormous levels of detail by the administration to congressional investigators, and the attempt to politicize the talking points, again, is part of an effort to chase after what isn\'t the substance here. \xc2\xa0The substance is the diplomatic facility in Benghazi was attacked; four Americans were killed; the President has been committed from day one to finding and bringing to justice those responsible, and committed from day one to ensuring that we take every step we can to protect our diplomats in the future and to ensure that this kind of event doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd you know within the hours of the attack, beginning with a press release that was much maligned even by members of his own party, the Republican nominee for President tried to politicize this, and that has been the case ever since. \xc2\xa0And it, unfortunately, continues to this day. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI mean, again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen levels of cooperation here that are rather extraordinary -- 25,000 pages of documents; 20 staff briefings; 10 congressional hearings. \xc2\xa0And nothing that we expect to hear today in this hearing contradicts anything that has already been discussed and revealed, assessed by the Accountability Review Board. \xc2\xa0I mean, if it is the position of critics that that review board and its two chairs are not being faithful to the facts and the truth, then I think they have to discuss that with the chairs of the board. \xc2\xa0But the fact is that this has been looked at exhaustively.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, Jay, I\'m specifically asking about what you said. \xc2\xa0And even what you just said about stylistic changes -- these changes look much more than stylistic. \xc2\xa0I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s references to security concerns expressed on September 10th, the day before the attack, being taken out. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s references to al Qaeda being taken out --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What we said and what remains true to this day is that the intelligence community drafted and redrafted these points. \xc2\xa0They were not -- and I think that that is what the Deputy Director of the CIA has said. \xc2\xa0And the fact that there is input from others doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that the CIA or the intelligence community drafts these points consistent with what they know -- they\xe2\x80\x99re drafting points to provide information to members of Congress as well as members of the administration so that they can speak publicly about it. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd again, if you look substantively at the information provided in the talking points about what happened in Benghazi, I think that reflects everything that we\'ve said. \xc2\xa0I mean, to this day, it has to be acknowledged that those talking points that Susan Rice -- Ambassador Rice went out and used on those Sunday shows, and that I, of course, used when I discussed it, made clear, A, that we believed that extremists were involved in the attack, and B, that we knew that more information would come to light and that our understanding of what happened would be affected as that information became available. \xc2\xa0And every bit of information that\'s become available about it in those days following and weeks following was provided by us, because we were committed then and now to making sure we found out what happened, who was responsible, and make sure that we could take steps to prevent it from happening again.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEd.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, do you still believe that an anti-Muslim video sparked the terror attack then?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, Ed. \xc2\xa0I think this has been, again, adjudicated and assessed and litigated many times. \xc2\xa0And that is \xc2\xa0-- when you look at those talking points, the one reference there is to protests that turned out not to be the case. \xc2\xa0But I would remind you that on the Friday before the Sunday appearances, we had violent demonstrations going on at embassy facilities around the world. \xc2\xa0We had a black flag raised at one of our embassies. \xc2\xa0We had breaches of walls at another embassy. \xc2\xa0We had a great deal of concern as a result of the protests surrounding these videos about the safety and security of diplomatic personnel around the region and the world. \xc2\xa0And it is entirely appropriate that there was concern about that, and I think understandable that there was some possibility of a connection between the kind of violent demonstrations we were seeing in Cairo and what took place in Benghazi. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut in the end, if you look at what was said -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s just review the facts because it gets a little simplistic. \xc2\xa0Here is what Ambassador Rice said on \xe2\x80\x9cFace the Nation\xe2\x80\x9d that Sunday: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear that there were extremist elements that joined and escalated the violence. \xc2\xa0Whether they were al Qaeda affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al Qaeda itself I think is one of the things we\'ll have to determine.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThat is a simple statement of the facts that we knew when we knew them. \xc2\xa0And that is on the Sunday about which so much has been discussed and misrepresented.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another fact is that she and you from this podium around that time period would not call it a terror attack. \xc2\xa0And among the things Mr. Hicks is testifying under oath about today is he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that -- quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the get-go, the people in authority\xe2\x80\x9d -- not just on the ground, but people in authority who were following this back in Washington knew this was a terror attack. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What did the President say when he spoke about it for the first time?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He referred to terror, generally, I believe -- acts of terror.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0An act of terror. \xc2\xa0Because that\'s what it was, by definition --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Daily Show a few days later he said we still don\'t know -- right?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Ed, everything we said --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, you\'re talking about facts. \xc2\xa0Did he say that on the Daily Show?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0He said the first time he talked about this publicly that it was an act of terror -- by definition, a violent assault on a diplomatic facility is an act of terror. \xc2\xa0What we did not know right away was who was responsible. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why there is an investigation and why there was an investigation that was launched right away. \xc2\xa0And that\'s absolutely the responsible thing to do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the question of the Accountability Review Board, you keep saying it was unsparing and you said they had unfettered access. \xc2\xa0Did Admiral Mullen and Mr. Pickering interview the President about what he did on the night of September 11th?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I will point you to what Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Pickering said and what the report said, beginning with the fact that -- this is useful here. \xc2\xa0The Accountability Review Board investigation, headed by, as I said, two of the most respected, non-partisan leaders in Washington, found that the interagency response was timely and appropriate and \xe2\x80\x9chelped save the lives of two severely wounded Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe ARB interviewed more than 100 people, reviewed thousands of documents, and watched hours of video. \xc2\xa0The ARB interviewed Gregory Hicks -- who\xe2\x80\x99s testifying today -- and Eric Nordstrom, as well as the head of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Counterterrorism Bureau, Ambassador Daniel Benjamin. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe ARB report was unsparing in its critique and criticisms, but the State Department accepted it and is in the process of implementing each of its 29 recommendations to improve embassy security and help ensure that this tragedy is not repeated.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs I said, quoting Ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning of the ARB process, we had unfettered access to everyone and everything, including all the documentation we needed. \xc2\xa0Our marching orders were to get to the bottom of what happened, and that is what we did.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 As you know, when the President heard about the attack as it was underway in Benghazi, he was with the Secretary of Defense and ordered instantly that every resource be brought to bear to deal with that situation in Benghazi and to make sure that steps were taken to ensure the safety of our diplomatic personnel around the region and the world. \xc2\xa0And that is what happened, and that is what the ARB assessed to have happened.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0You were talking about Syria a couple days ago and you said the lessons of Iraq are not too far in the distant past, that lessons are to be learned from Iraq at the start of the war more than a decade ago. \xc2\xa0How does that square with last week when you were talking about Benghazi, you said Benghazi was a long time ago? \xc2\xa0It was only eight months ago. \xc2\xa0Do you regret saying that, or do you want to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure what the point you\'re trying to make --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You were saying Benghazi was a long time ago and this has been --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What I\'m saying -- what I was saying then and what I\'m saying now is that we have assessed a great deal of information provided by the administration to congressional investigators -- 25,000 pages of documents, congressional hearings, staff briefings -- and that attempts to politicize this, which have guided Republicans, unfortunately, since the hours after the attack and the Republican nominee for President issued a highly misguided press release about it in an attempt to turn it into a political issue, have been unfortunate and haven\'t been focused on the problem itself, which is that four Americans were killed in an attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi, and that the people responsible need to be brought to justice and steps need to be taken to ensure that that kind of attack never happens again. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the President\'s focus. \xc2\xa0And he remains committed to both propositions.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBrianna.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, you\'ve talked about the motivations of the Republicans who are leading the House hearings on Benghazi. \xc2\xa0What about the witnesses? \xc2\xa0Do you think they\'re politicizing what happened?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I can only say -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any insight into that. \xc2\xa0And all I can say is that we have been unaware of anyone being blocked from talking to the Congress if they choose to do so. \xc2\xa0The fact is that two of the witnesses that I mentioned earlier were interviewed by ARB, which investigated what happened in Benghazi, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that anything we\'ll hear today will conflict with the vast amount of information we already know about what happened in Benghazi. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the ARB report. \xc2\xa0And in the investigation into who perpetrated these attacks, who\'s responsible for the deaths of Americans continues. And this President is committed to bringing to justice those who are responsible.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But they\'re saying things, obviously, that are very critical of certainly how the White House and the administration responded. \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t question their motivations?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0I\'m simply saying that --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re simply just raising concerns and looking --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I would say that there is -- there has been ongoing an effort underway by Republicans to politicize this. \xc2\xa0But beyond that, I\'m not going to question the motivations of those who are testifying. \xc2\xa0I would simply note that we have been enormously cooperative with congressional investigators into this matter, provided an enormous amount of information -- both documentation and videos and staff briefings, as well congressional testimony. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe Accountability Review Board that was stood up by the Secretary of State and endorsed by the President did a thorough investigation, according to Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Pickering. \xc2\xa0They were tasked with getting to the bottom of what happened, and that is what they did, according to the statement by Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Pickering. \xc2\xa0And that review was, as I think I\'ve said, unsparing and critical, and held people accountable, and demanded action -- action that the State Department has taken and is taking. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s our view of it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess I -- because you won\'t say that about the motivation, it just makes me wonder if just because, let\'s say it is being politicized, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there wasn\'t a substantial mess-up. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think the Accountability Review Board -- and I think this is the point I\'ve been trying to make -- made clear that there were failures, made clear that there were problems, and made clear who was responsible and what needed to be done to fix them. \xc2\xa0And what seems to be the case is that that\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfying politically to some in Congress, and therefore there\'s an effort to go further, perhaps along the line that Jon was talking about.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut the efforts -- they keep overshooting their mark here, like with this effort last week to turn a pro-forma signature on a cable into a scandal, which -- an accusation that\xe2\x80\x99s been laughed out of that room, appropriately, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold water. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0U.S. envoy Greg Hicks just testified a short time ago that when he heard Ambassador Rice on the Sunday talk shows saying that this started as a protest, he said he was stunned, that his jaw dropped, that he was embarrassed. \xc2\xa0Why then was she dispatched to say what she said? \xc2\xa0Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she represent what Hicks and others knew?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Brianna, I think we\'ve been through this so many times. \xc2\xa0These were talking points written by and drafted by the intelligence community. \xc2\xa0I just discussed this with --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0With input from the State Department?</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Not on this issue, as I understand it. \xc2\xa0And the fact is that there were demonstrations around the region and the world, there were violent demonstrations at embassy facilities around the region and the world. \xc2\xa0There was great concern about the possibility that those demonstrations would flare up and cause even more danger to diplomats -- American diplomats around the world. \xc2\xa0And this is the information that we had at the time. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd as we got more information, and as Ambassador Rice made clear that Sunday, once we got more information we would make it available, and clearly, the picture of what we knew to have happened would change. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut, again, if you look at what she said on Sunday -- I just quoted some of it -- we knew there were extremists involved. \xc2\xa0And I think it\'s pretty clear when we say extremists, in a place like Libya, what we\'re talking about. \xc2\xa0We knew there were extremists involved, but we did not know with any precision at that time, in those days after, exactly their affiliations or their motivations; whether they were al Qaeda or al Qaeda affiliates or just Libyan-based extremists. \xc2\xa0And at the time, we were telling \xc2\xa0-- we were being very transparent about what we knew and what we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in what Ambassador Rice, in what I said and what others said at the time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tPeter.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just very quickly, I wanted -- can you characterize the White House\'s input, then, on those talking points you said? \xc2\xa0Is it exclusively stylistic? \xc2\xa0Did the White House have some role in terms of input?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0This has been reported ad nauseam I think, but, yes, there was a change from referring to the structure of the building, the facility in Benghazi, from a \xe2\x80\x9cconsulate\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomatic facility\xe2\x80\x9d because it was not a consulate. \xc2\xa0And I think there was input on describing an \xe2\x80\x9congoing investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d which is the kind of language we always use when there is an ongoing investigation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So then in response to the Weekly Standard\xe2\x80\x99s reporting that demonstrates language that they think is more than just that, what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I would -- first of all, I would point you to -- these are emails, Peter. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s really worth looking at them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m sure -- I have.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure you have, because if you look at them you\xe2\x80\x99d recognize, A, we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided -- the administration has provided all this information to congressional investigators. \xc2\xa0And nothing in that article written even by the Weekly Standard contradicts anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the development of the talking points, who drafted them. \xc2\xa0And on the issue of what happened in Benghazi and what we knew and what was put out for public discussion by officials both in Congress and in the administration reflects what the intelligence community felt comfortable we could say about what we knew. \xc2\xa0And that included the fact that we believed extremists were participants in the attack.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask on a separate topic briefly -- police officials in Massachusetts said that the FBI has reluctantly been dragged into the effort to try to find a proper burial place for Tamerlan Tsarnaev. \xc2\xa0First question is should the FBI or the U.S. government in any form be involved in that process?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not on top of this. \xc2\xa0I would refer you to the FBI.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have any position on whether the government should play any role in this process? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a very heated --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a position on it at this time. \xc2\xa0I would refer you to the FBI.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Then I guess just as a quick aside, given recent events over the last 24 hours, does the White House have any thoughts or any comment on Mark Sanford becoming Representative-elect?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any to convey from here.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMara.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A question about tomorrow. \xc2\xa0It seems like the events and the company he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting, he could have done it in any other state. \xc2\xa0Why Texas?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- I think and hope that you\xe2\x80\x99re right that he could have done it in every state and that would be --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Many other states.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That would reflect what the President believes that in spite of the fact that Washington is, on occasion, throwing up obstacles to economic growth and job creation, that there are areas across the country where positive steps are being taken towards the kind of economic growth and job creation that the President talked about in the State of the Union; the kind of efforts underway to have the jobs of the future created here; efforts underway to ensure that the skills Americans need to take those jobs are provided to Americans who seek those skills; and that the jobs themselves provide the kind of wage and earnings that would give Americans the kind of security that a middle-class life is traditionally given in this country. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the focus. \xc2\xa0You heard the President talk about these three areas of concern when it comes to creating a thriving and rising middle class in America, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about in Austin tomorrow. \xc2\xa0I think that --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Texas is the only place you could find as an example?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, why not Texas? \xc2\xa0Austin is a hub of innovation and technology. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also a hub of education. \xc2\xa0And the President, as you know, will have a series of events tomorrow that reflect these three areas that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about since the State of the Union -- the need to make sure that we have these kinds of jobs of the future here in the United States, the need to ensure that our workers have the skills they need to fill those jobs, and the necessity that those jobs pay well enough to sustain a middle-class life. \xc2\xa0And Austin is a great place to go for that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So does this have anything to do with the Democrats long-term hopes about Texas?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0It does strike me that suggestions that people sometimes in Washington see everything through an electoral lens are true, but I can guarantee you that is not what this is about.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, and just quick. \xc2\xa0There are two things that certainly were in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget and State of the Union address that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t talked about much, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it will come up tomorrow -- the minimum wage and the tobacco tax to pay for universal pre-K.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t want to overly preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks. \xc2\xa0I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be more exciting if you don\'t have all of the content. \xc2\xa0I think that minimum wage does go the point -- the third point that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about, which is the need to ensure that the jobs that are created here that are jobs of the future, that both are -- that Americans have the skills they need to hold those jobs and get those jobs, but also that the jobs pay the kind of living and wage that allows for entrance into and the ability to remain in the middle class.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about the tobacco tax?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- in either case I\xe2\x80\x99m not previewing the remarks. \xc2\xa0You know the President --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President talks and will talk a lot about the value of early education, the need to provide pre-K for all in this country, and the investment that represents, and the quality investment that represents for our country in terms of our future. \xc2\xa0Getting that early start on education for our children will pay dividends for decades in terms of economic growth and job creation. \xc2\xa0So again I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview specifically the remarks he\xe2\x80\x99ll make in Austin, but that is certainly a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMark, and then April.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, back on Syria. \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry and the Russian Foreign Minister announced a conference on Syria where there will try to be yet another effort to find sort of a political or diplomatic transition. \xc2\xa0The President yesterday when asked about Syria did not mention at all deliberations in the White House about supplying the rebels with lethal weapons. \xc2\xa0And some European diplomats in recent days have begun expressing more caution about moving toward providing lethal weapons themselves. Does the White House see all this as adding up to a belief that where we are in Syria now, it might be worth making one more big diplomatic push, and that, indeed, the conversation in the last couple of weeks has moved away a bit from changing the military equation on the ground to trying to find a political and diplomatic solution?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, these are excellent questions. \xc2\xa0And, Mark, I would say that the tracks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued have been operative all along, that we have pursued from the beginning a political transition. \xc2\xa0We made clear from the beginning that we felt that that was the best way to bring about a positive outcome to this, a future -- a transition in Syria that provided the potential for a future in Syria that was more democratic and better for the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd as you noted, yesterday in Moscow, Secretary Kerry reiterated our belief that the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9 framework is the best way to find a durable solution to the Syrian crisis and should be the road map by which the international community and the Syrian people work to hasten an end to the conflict through a political transition to a democratic, unified and inclusive post-Assad Syria. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, the United States and Russia have recommitted to that framework, which calls for a transitional governing body formed on the basis of mutual consent and exercising full executive powers. \xc2\xa0So we have been and we continue to pursue that track. \xc2\xa0We have been and continue to have conversations with the Russians about the important role they can play in helping bring about the necessary political transition in Syria.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe have been and continue to provide and step up aid to the Syrian people, humanitarian aid as well as assistance to the Syrian opposition and the Supreme Military Council, that\'s part of the opposition, nonlethal aid. \xc2\xa0But we have stepped that up, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an increasing level of assistance. \xc2\xa0So these are separate but related tracks that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing at the same time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And does lethal weapons remain an option in that trajectory of aid to the military?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0They do in the sense that, as the President has said, every option remains on the table. \xc2\xa0Even prior to the last couple of weeks when we had the questions about possible chemical weapons use in Syria, I have made clear and others have made clear that we are constantly reviewing our options on Syria, including the question of providing lethal aid thus far. \xc2\xa0And at this point we have concluded that we will limit our provision of aid to nonlethal assistance. \xc2\xa0But that is something we are constantly reviewing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tApril.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, back on the Benghazi issue. \xc2\xa0What has happened, what concrete steps have come out of the Benghazi situation as far as securing and protecting embassies around the world, especially after it\xe2\x80\x99s been told that there was no way to get help to those who were killed in Benghazi in time?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would point you to the 29 recommendations that were made by the Accountability Review Board, and the fact that the State Department is acting on all of them -- implementing some of them already, and acting on the others. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a detailed list of what those actions are and what actions have been taken, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the State Department does.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that it is clearly unacceptable when four Americans are killed in an attack like this, and it represents the need to assess our security for our diplomats and diplomatic facilities and make changes. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Accountability Review Board recommended, and I know that\'s what the State Department is adopting.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the White House is not overseeing to see if some of these steps have been concretely put into place, like stepped-up security? \xc2\xa0Because many embassies around the world have very little -- or had very little security.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that in terms of specific security measures that were taken in the wake of the attacks and at various times since that that has happened. \xc2\xa0I would refer you -- State would have the breakdown on where that\'s happened.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tOn the recommendations made by the ARB, there were some more institutional recommendations, as well as specific steps. \xc2\xa0And the State Department could fill you in on the details.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat I know the President believes and was pleased to see is that steps needed to be taken, and he was very supportive of then-Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which was to accept the report and act on every one of the recommendations.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tScott.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0The President said yesterday that the United States has a moral obligation to do something in Syria. \xc2\xa0Does providing humanitarian aid and the diplomacy that the President is involved in around Syria meet that moral obligation in his view?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that providing humanitarian aid, as we do as the largest provider of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, represents our belief that we here in the United States and other nations around the world have a moral obligation to assist the Syrian people in this terrible time. \xc2\xa0But I think that, as the President made clear yesterday and has made clear repeatedly over the last several days, we are constantly assessing what other steps we can take or might take, and that has included both stepping up our humanitarian aid and stepping up our assistance to the opposition.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIt includes reviewing options as I just discussed with Mark, like military options, a provision of lethal aid. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s all done also through the prism that the President discussed yesterday, which is making decisions that are in the best interest of the American people and the national security of the United States. \xc2\xa0So I think that all of these considerations are ones that he weighs as he deliberates over the options available to him and over the developments in Syria.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are differences obviously between Syria and Libya. \xc2\xa0But in explaining to the American people the Libyan intervention, he said that other countries may turn a blind eye to Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s threats, that the United States was different. \xc2\xa0I know the United States is not doing -- is doing things in Syria, but again, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there an American interest to some degree in doing more there to demonstrate what he feels is a moral obligation in a place like Syria where now 70,000 people have been --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0First of all, I think a couple of things are important to note, which is that the United States did take the lead and act in response to the situation in Libya in concert with a number of allies. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t think that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that others did not. \xc2\xa0The French and the British were key partners in that effort, as were other nations.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe fact of the matter is in Syria that it is, the President believes, an obligation of ours to act, and that\'s why we have acted. \xc2\xa0That\'s why we have provided more humanitarian aid than any other country. \xc2\xa0That\'s why we have led the effort to help stand up the opposition and help the opposition organize itself. It\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized the Syrian Opposition Coalition, and why we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided direct assistance to the Supreme Military Council, I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s called, of the opposition.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re assessing other options all the time. \xc2\xa0But the President made clear, I think if not yesterday then in the days preceding, that we have to make sure that the things that we do are the right choices and help bring about the ultimate goal here, which is the transition in Syria to a post-Assad future and that things that help bring about a reduction and ultimate end to the violence in Syria. \xc2\xa0And you don\'t want to do something that has the opposite effect, and that is something that we assess all the time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Finally last thing, has the President talked with President Clinton at all about this in terms of his experience in the Balkan war and Kosovo and his decision to finally --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0They speak with some regularity, but I just don\'t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ve had that conversation.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tLisa, and then Mark.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the immigration bill, it\xe2\x80\x99s moving into the mark-up. Is the President concerned at all that the hundreds of amendments being introduced could undermine the sort of bipartisan basis of the bill? \xc2\xa0And also will he be more specific about his views on the various parts of the legislation, the amendments, things like that now that we\xe2\x80\x99re in this new phase?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We are monitoring this very closely. \xc2\xa0We are engaged with both the leaders in the Senate of this effort as well as staff who are engaged in this effort. \xc2\xa0And we remain optimistic that the Senate can and will produce bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would represent a huge advance in this country and would be in keeping with the principles the President laid out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut it is important to note, and I think this goes to your question, that we are still a long way from that -- achieving that goal, and a lot of work remains to be done. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in this process with the Senate and monitoring very closely the developments that you talk about. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment to make of any of the many amendments. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI only would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief and hope that it is essential for a bill to emerge that is bipartisan in nature that achieves the principles that he laid forward, the principles that are shared by the bipartisan Gang of Eight. \xc2\xa0And he believes that if that does happen that we can see a bill pass out of the Senate with substantial support, which would be enormous progress towards the goal of having a law emerge from Congress that he can sign. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re working every day to help bring that about.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I noticed that you guys haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- in the previews of the trip tomorrow, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been much mention of immigration. Why is that? \xc2\xa0Is he not going to talk about it? \xc2\xa0It seems like a natural place, given the Latino population, the tech companies.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I thought we were going there for political reasons. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep track. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI can assure you the President is making a trip tomorrow that\xe2\x80\x99s about middle-class jobs and opportunity. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on economic issues that are at the core of his agenda and have always been at the core of his agenda. \xc2\xa0And they go directly to the questions he raised in the State of the Union address that need to be answered -- are we creating these jobs; are we providing the skills to our people that they need to hold these jobs; and are those jobs paying the kind of wage that allows for a middle-class life in America. \xc2\xa0And this is sort of the essence of what has been the primary focus of this President since he came into office amidst the worst recession of our lifetimes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what this trip will be about. \xc2\xa0You have heard him and will hear him on many occasions talk about comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0But tomorrow will be about economic matters.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMark, and then Jared.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s objective tonight at this dinner with House Democratic leaders?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, this is part of the ongoing conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s had with lawmakers of both parties in both houses. \xc2\xa0He looks forward to it. \xc2\xa0He expects the conversation to range over the numerous issues that are confronting Congress right now and that the President is engaged in, all of his priorities. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing specific beyond that. \xc2\xa0I mean, he looks forward to it as he has to every dinner or meeting or golf game that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with lawmakers of late.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who pays for these dinners?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think it changes, but in this case I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure the DNC is paying for it. \xc2\xa0But I will have to check. \xc2\xa0Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll check, yes. \xc2\xa0I know at the first one the President picked up the bill.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the President satisfied with the level of support that he gets from House Democratic leaders?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0He is. \xc2\xa0Look, I think that he believes that when it comes to making sure that middle-class Americans and those who aspire to the middle class are given the opportunities and the tools that they need is a goal that he and Democrats in the House and the Senate all share, and that Republicans by and large share, and that that is why there should be and maybe could be an opportunity to find some common ground on these economic issues. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI mean, when we talk about the -- what some have called a rebirth, a renaissance of manufacturing in this country, and the element of that that has been focused on high-tech innovation, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t and generally has not been a partisan goal or pursuit. \xc2\xa0It\'s something that Republicans and Democrats alike have supported investments in that kind of economic growth and development. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe same is true of the kind of infrastructure investments that we need to make in a country like ours to ensure that, as the President lamented the other day, we are not faced with a situation where not a single American airport makes the list of the best 25 airports in the world. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are. \xc2\xa0We used to build and we should build the best airports, and the best ports, and the best highways. \xc2\xa0And we need to make the investments to ensure that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case in the 21st century as it was in the 20th. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJared, I think I called -- yes, and then Susan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, when -- 11 states now have moved forward on marriage equality -- Rhode Island and of course Delaware, most recently. \xc2\xa0So does the President -- one, does the President think that this is the -- does he have a reaction to that? \xc2\xa0And two, does he still think that state by state is the best way that we should be pursuing that civil rights movement?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, there has been enormous progress made. \xc2\xa0And I think that the facts, as you just recited them, demonstrate the progress made. \xc2\xa0The President\'s views are known. \xc2\xa0He\'s expressed them. \xc2\xa0Our views on issues like DOMA and Prop 8 have been expressed in legal filings, so I would point you to those. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tFor him, it\'s a fundamental issue of equal rights, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he has taken the position he\'s taken. \xc2\xa0But for our legal approach to some of these issues, I would refer you to the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then on -- just on Benghazi really quickly. \xc2\xa0Is it the administration\'s position or your position that the only criticism that\xe2\x80\x99s coming from lawmakers of both parties or from media outlets is politically motivated?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Generally speaking, Jared, I don\xe2\x80\x99t come up here and give just my position; I give the administration and the White House position.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0It is our view, and it is a simple fact, that from the early hours of the attack there have been attempts by the Republicans to politicize what was a tragic attack on our facility in Benghazi that led to the deaths of four Americans, including our ambassador to Libya. \xc2\xa0That has been demonstrated again and again. \xc2\xa0And we have cooperated with congressional investigators, providing 25,000 pages of documents, numerous staff briefings, numerous appearances for testimony before congressional committees --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And because of that effort that you\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken, you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s any window for legitimate criticism left?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think there was legitimate criticism that was amply aired in the Accountability Review Board report that was unsparing and critical, and that the State Department, instead of being defensive about it, accepted in whole and is acting on every recommendation contained therein. \xc2\xa0So I think our response to this demonstrates the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to finding out what happened, who was responsible, bringing them to justice, and ensuring that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s been our focus. \xc2\xa0There has been -- there have been other focuses -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been another focus by others, but it has not been ours.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSusan, last one. \xc2\xa0And then George.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0Two questions on Benghazi. \xc2\xa0Envoy Hicks said today in his testimony that, unfortunately, the ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s body was carried to a hospital run by Ansar al-Sharia, a known terrorist group, that night. \xc2\xa0And that he knew this and he was conveying that message to the State Department. \xc2\xa0And so if that was the case, then why was there any dispute whether it was a terrorist act or not the next -- the following Sunday?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Because of the nature of the hospital? \xc2\xa0Again, I think that --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because it was run by a known terrorist group.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to respond to live reports on what\xe2\x80\x99s being said on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that it was the assessment of our intelligence community that the attacks were participated in by extremists. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Ambassador Rice said. \xc2\xa0She said on that Sunday that extremists were involved, what we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know is what their exact affiliation was.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs you know, with regard to this group, there was a claim of responsibility, then there was a disowning of responsibility. \xc2\xa0So anybody who pretends to have known all the facts instantly is just mistaken. \xc2\xa0And it is always the case that things like this require careful investigation, and that is what\xe2\x80\x99s been undertaken.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the second question I had was on the stylistic, not substantive, edits to the talking points. \xc2\xa0And from testimony today we are seeing that those edits struck any and all suggestions that the State Department had been previously warned of threats in the region; that there had been previous attacks in Benghazi by al Qaeda-linked groups in Benghazi and eastern Libya; and that extremists linked to al Qaeda may have participated in the attack on the Benghazi mission. \xc2\xa0Is that substance or stylistic?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, again, I would point you to the intelligence community and the fact that they made the drafts and they issued the points. \xc2\xa0Secondly, I would say when it comes to stylistic edits we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about the specific edits that were made at the suggestion of the White House. \xc2\xa0And, again, when it comes to -- one of the edits you just mentioned, the talking points as delivered referred to extremists and we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about -- when we talk about extremists in the region that Libya is in, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. \xc2\xa0But assertions that people knew --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell me why --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I would refer you to the intelligence community.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was made by a CIA official. \xc2\xa0I want to make that clear. \xc2\xa0But I do --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0So I would refer you to the CIA.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tGeorge.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0Did the President watch any of the hearing this morning? \xc2\xa0Did you watch any of it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I did not. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he did, but I doubt it. \xc2\xa0He tends not to watch TV during the day.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think that was the last, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Cheryl because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t called on her in a while. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Just to follow up, without using any names, can you just tell me if the President is planning to appoint an advisor to Todd Park? \xc2\xa0Is he vetting --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information about that than Todd himself was able to provide. \xc2\xa0Sorry.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThanks very much.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t1:44 P.M. EDT</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
