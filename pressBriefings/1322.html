GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We are lucky to be joined today by our National Incident Commander -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all read the press release yesterday, newly retired Admiral Thad Allen, joining us today sans his several decades of uniform, to give us an update on the BP oil spill, our response to Deepwater Horizon.\xc2\xa0 And I will give it over to him.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Afternoon.\xc2\xa0 As you can see, my wife\xe2\x80\x99s taken me to a men\xe2\x80\x99s store in the last couple weeks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It was an honor to serve in the United States Coast Guard for 39 years, and today I transition to a senior executive on Secretary Napolitano\xe2\x80\x99s staff as I carry on my duties as a National Incident Commander.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So with that quick overview on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, as you know, the hurricane passed by, generated some swells and weather up towards the well site that required us to delay bringing onboard the third production vessel, the Helix Producer, which we thought we would have online by today.\xc2\xa0 We will need about three days after the weather calms to less than three to five feet for that vessel to be able to hook up to the flexible coupling that it will be required to do.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at somewhere around mid-week next week to bring the third production vessel online.\xc2\xa0 It will bring our capacity up to 53,000 barrels per day.</p>\n<p>In the 24-hour period that ended last night at midnight, we actually recovered 23,000 barrels.\xc2\xa0 The Discovery Enterprise had to stop operations a couple of times due to lightning in the area.\xc2\xa0 As you remember, we had a situation a few weeks ago where lighting struck the derrick and caused a fire.\xc2\xa0 So there are some safety reasons why they might have to stop from time to time.\xc2\xa0 And the Q4000 actually flared 8,200 barrels.</p>\n<p>Regarding the relief wells, Development Driller III now is at a distance of 11,641 feet below the seafloor.\xc2\xa0 As you know, they\xe2\x80\x99re going through a series of operations which we call ranging.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re into their fourth cycle of this.\xc2\xa0 In ranging, they withdraw the drill pipe and put down an electrical cable and actually try and sense the magnetic field around the wellbore.\xc2\xa0 They are within around 15 feet of the wellbore at this point.\xc2\xa0 They will continue down 700, 800 more feet, slowly close into the wellbore, and when they know they\xe2\x80\x99ve got it exactly in range, know exactly where the drill pipe is in relation to the wellbore, then they will attempt to move in and drill through the wellbore and then the casing as well.\xc2\xa0 At that point they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to be able to try the bottom kill or to be able to insert the mud, and hopefully after that, put a cement plug in that will kill the well.</p>\n<p>Development Driller II is 6,720 feet below the seafloor and is making progress as well.</p>\n<p>Our onshore and near-shore skimming and recovery operation has been significantly hampered by the weather.\xc2\xa0 The small vessels that do the skimming have a difficult time operating out there; we had to pull them back.\xc2\xa0 The same with the vessels operating in and around the well site itself.</p>\n<p>The drilling rigs were able to continue, but we are now massing our forces to be able to move right back out once the weather will allow us to get on the water and skim.\xc2\xa0 In some of the areas such as Barataria Bay and other places we were able to have back bay skimmers and actually make some progress there.\xc2\xa0 But in general, waiting for the weather to abate so we can move on with recovery operations.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Happy to take questions on this or other topics today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For Admiral Allen, can you talk about this new 20-meter safety zone, and if that was done at BP\xe2\x80\x99s request, or what the reason is to do this at this stage in the crisis?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Can you be more specific?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The safety zone for vessels around plumes and other oil response.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Oh.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual at all for the Coast Guard to establish either safety or security zones around any number of facilities or activities for public safety and for the safety of the equipment itself.\xc2\xa0 We would do this for marine events, fireworks demonstrations, cruise ships going in and out of port.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but we\xe2\x80\x99re so far into this disaster now, why do it now and why the new --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I actually had some personal complaints from some county commissioners in Florida and some other local mayors that thought that there was a chance that somebody would get hurt or they would have a problem with the boom itself -- had not presented itself before, but once presented with it, the logical thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a BP request?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one really quickly for you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On the climate bill, is it -- I think some environmentalists are under the impression that the administration is now asking for a vote before August, and limiting any kind of cap or pricing to the electric utilities -- is that accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said that -- and the Senate has said that after coming back from the recess, one of the things that they will do is likely take up energy.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 The President had a good meeting a couple of days ago with bipartisan -- with senators from both parties that have led on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve not made any final determinations about the size and scope of the legislation except to say that the President believes, and continues to believe, that putting a price on carbon has to be part of our comprehensive energy reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet to limit it to just one industry, for instance?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, this is -- whether this is energy or immigration, this is going to have to be something that\xe2\x80\x99s discussed with Democrats and Republicans alike.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 First for the Admiral.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe -- will skimming operations start again this weekend, or do you know when that will start again?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 It depends on the type of skimming equipment and the sea state.\xc2\xa0 Some of the larger vessels that operate offshore will be able to get out quicker.\xc2\xa0 When you get over three to five feet, some of the smaller skimmers -- say, 30, 40 feet in length -- have a very difficult time operating and being effective.\xc2\xa0 So it will be weather-based.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were some rumors in the financial markets today that the well had been capped, which is obviously not true.\xc2\xa0 Is there any information that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten about progress --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Including me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I would say this, as they get closer to the wellbore, getting into the position to make that final drilling into the wellbore and the casing itself, there is a chance -- slight chance -- they could nick the wellbore.\xc2\xa0 Because of that, they have a vessel up there that\xe2\x80\x99s full of mud waiting to be able to shoot it in if they have a problem there.\xc2\xa0 But nothing to my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, along the same lines, can you give us an idea as to when the administration will be releasing its new report on -- or its new decision on the offshore drilling moratorium?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that will come from the Department of Interior, I would expect in the next few days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the next few days?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 And one non-oil-spill-related question -- there\xe2\x80\x99s growing fear among economists and financial markets about the possibility of a double-dip recession.\xc2\xa0 The President met with Chairman Bernanke earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern that the President has, and is there -- are you preparing plans or a way to address that now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we continue to work towards improving our economy, creating an environment for job creation.\xc2\xa0 The Senate took up I think two days ago a cloture vote on our small business lending initiative that the House had previously passed.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we believe financial reform is a big part of our economic recovery so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves in the same situation this September that we did two years ago.</p>\n<p>So I would just simply say we continue each and every day to look at and to monitor events here, and obviously we now understand over the course of the past several months the news that -- from overseas, how much that can affect our markets here and economic prospects here.</p>\n<p>So the economic team continues to look at and advise the President on anything that they believe would be important to continuing our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>You heard the Vice President a week or so ago come in here and describe the ramping up of projects inside the Recovery Act that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place this summer.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get new jobs numbers obviously tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to evaluate sort of where we are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that word, \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-dip,\xe2\x80\x9d come up in those morning economic briefings?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- our economic conditions and the plight that we face, based on the fact that what we\xe2\x80\x99re -- the pothole that we\xe2\x80\x99re in, if you will, if you look at that chart, what I mean by that is the chart that I showed you guys on the amount of job loss, of 8.5 million jobs, obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re always concerned about the trajectory of and the fragility of that recovery.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been the case, though, honestly, Jeff, since the moment we walked in here.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the state of the economy is constantly on our mind.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on immigration reform, what are the chances that enough Republicans will come onboard and that this will get done this year, in 2010?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, if you had, as you heard the President say -- look, well, let me start it this way.\xc2\xa0 I think where there\xe2\x80\x99s a will there\xe2\x80\x99s a way, right?\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a will among Democrats and Republicans, specifically Republicans on this issue, then there\xe2\x80\x99s a way.\xc2\xa0 We know that\xe2\x80\x99s true.</p>\n<p>We have, as you heard the President talk about, Republicans that have supported this in the past that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been as supportive or as vocal in their support of comprehensive reform as they have been in the past, as they were when, as the President lauded former President Bush for dealing with this issue.</p>\n<p>We know this, that the issue of immigration and immigration reform has been in the news a lot lately because of the steps that were taken in Arizona.\xc2\xa0 We understand that we can\xe2\x80\x99t have each state have its own immigration law, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s up to those in Washington to solve the problems that have existed, quite frankly, for many, many years.</p>\n<p>So where there\xe2\x80\x99s a will on the Republican side of the aisle, there will be a way forward on comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the oil spill, if I may, House Republicans today released a report that\xe2\x80\x99s critical of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s cleanup efforts.\xc2\xa0 Specifically they say they have evidence that administration officials \xe2\x80\x9chave misrepresented key facts, including the number of assets dedicated to cleaning up the spill, the timing of when officials knew about the oil leak.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty transparent throughout this response.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood up here and talked to you all very frankly.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you the numbers that we have.\xc2\xa0 Those numbers are rolled up from the reports we get from the folks that are downrange there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve been downrange myself.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to all four states; I go frequently, traveled both with the President and the Vice President this week.\xc2\xa0 Every indication I have that the numbers are coming up are the numbers that are there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You can always find a place where there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody on the beach not cleaning, where it\xe2\x80\x99s empty, and you can find a piece of water where there\xe2\x80\x99s no skimmer; it\xe2\x80\x99s just that big an area down there.\xc2\xa0 But this thing has evolved from the start, and from a massive monolithic oil spill to thousands and hundreds of thousands of small patches of oil.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s required us to change our tactics, move to a more skimmer-based approach from the boom approach that was originally requested by the governors.\xc2\xa0 But I think throughout the entire life cycle of the event we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty up front with the resources that have been out there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s more about the complexity of this operation rather than transparency?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s the most complex thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been involved in.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s transformed itself way beyond a normal oil spill response. And early on the governors were very concerned about protecting their resources with boom, and we put a lot of boom out.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point now where were double- and triple-booming places.\xc2\xa0 And our goal is to approach 200 percent of the basic boom requirement, to just continue to do that to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting everything as much as we can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact of the nature of the spill has changed.\xc2\xa0 We had new flow rate numbers several weeks ago, as you know.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s put a premium on skimming capability -- all kinds of skimming capability, very shallow skimming capability into the back areas like Barataria Bay, to the very heavy-duty skimmers offshore.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very aggressively acquiring those right now.\xc2\xa0 The spill has evolved and we\xe2\x80\x99ve evolved with it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add to this.\xc2\xa0 I scanned a portion of this.\xc2\xa0 Part of what he purports to address is that somehow it took the command 70 days to accept international help.\xc2\xa0 That is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a myth that has been debunked literally hundreds of times.\xc2\xa0 There were already 24 foreign vessels that were operating in the Gulf before the State Department announced two days ago additional international assistance.\xc2\xa0 As early as May 11th, boom had arrived from Mexico, Norway and Brazil.</p>\n<p>Part of the report mentions that our failure to waive the Jones Act has been a problem; that, again, a myth that has I think been debunked on any number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 And I would say one thing to Congressman Issa, Plaquemines is spelled P-l-a-q-u-e-m-i-n-e-s.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that, though?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first one to Admiral Allen, about the skimmers.\xc2\xa0 I understand that there is somewhat of a super skimmer, a mega-ship called \xe2\x80\x9cA Whale, from the Taiwanese.\xc2\xa0 I just wonder what is the status of approval on that and how effective do you think that ship will be?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d call that a skimmer.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a developmental project that we want to see how it works.\xc2\xa0 The owners made an offer to bring it down at their expense and have it operate in the Gulf area to see if it could be effective.\xc2\xa0 We have worked with EPA and other regulatory agencies to give it a go, and it\xe2\x80\x99s down in the area; it will be ready to operate in a couple of days.<br/>\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re anxious to find out how effective it will be.\xc2\xa0 But it is a very large ship that\xe2\x80\x99s been converted to be able to recover oil, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how it goes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can get a timeline for you.\xc2\xa0 It I think came from Portugal, was retrofitted until mid-June in Lisbon, and then made its way down to the Gulf.*</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have high hopes for that?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have high hopes for anything that can be effective down there.\xc2\xa0 As you realize, this is an all-hands-on-deck evolution.\xc2\xa0 We need to mass our forces, and anything that\xe2\x80\x99s effective we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to using.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Robert, to follow on Dan\xe2\x80\x99s question about immigration reform, I just wondered, the President is famous for saying that nothing in D.C. happens without a deadline.\xc2\xa0 Why not set one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress on this before.\xc2\xa0 We know Washington can do this.\xc2\xa0 But unless or until Republicans that have been doing this before, that have been supportive of immigration reform, that have spoken out eloquently about the need for it -- until they get back into this game -- and by that I mean into the legislative arena to solve this problem -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get solved.\xc2\xa0 And people should understand that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We all know that despite what you learned on Schoolhouse Rock, it\xe2\x80\x99s not 50, it\xe2\x80\x99s 60 votes in the Senate, right?\xc2\xa0 Probably to rename a courthouse it takes 60 votes, right?\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t 60 Democrats in the Senate and they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily -- of the 59 that are there, or that normally vote with the Democrats, they may not all support it.\xc2\xa0 You have to have the support of the many Republicans that have in the past believed that comprehensive immigration reform was the only way to move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get done, is this the President\xe2\x80\x99s fault or is this a Republican failure?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it is clear -- if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear before today, the President laid out exactly what the problem was that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been facing for years.\xc2\xa0 He laid out very specific solutions to what needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 He is ready, willing and able to work with anybody.\xc2\xa0 But unless or until those on the Republican side come back into this arena and decide this is a situation that they want to solve, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be solved.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, what is the percentage chance that the relief well project is going to work?\xc2\xa0 Is it close to 100 percent?\xc2\xa0 And what do you think now -- can you pick a date and say when it is really going to happen?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to attach a percentage to anything we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in this spill.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you this.\xc2\xa0 Contrary -- unlike some other things that have been done on the seabed out there at 5,000 feet -- you heard me say before, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing something we\xe2\x80\x99ve never done before.\xc2\xa0 Relief wells are things that these companies have done before, not just BP, but all the companies.\xc2\xa0 The methods they\xe2\x80\x99re using, the technology they\xe2\x80\x99re using, it\xe2\x80\x99s all been proven in the water, on land.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think we have a little bit better basis by which to understand the potential for this to be successful.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they\xe2\x80\x99re not reinventing the wheel, if you will, it\xe2\x80\x99s something they\xe2\x80\x99ve done before.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve mitigated the risk by having the second well be dug.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of detailed briefings and I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed this quite in detail -- the technical issues associated with this ranging in how they do that, and this is a very precise method for locating that wellbore.</p>\n<p>So I think we stand a good chance -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put a number on it.\xc2\xa0 The current goal is by mid-August.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re slightly ahead of schedule.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we ought to say -- we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come off that mid-August date until we know they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually gone through the wellbore.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But \xe2\x80\x9cgood chance\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very optimistic.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d rather under-promise than over-deliver with you folks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following -- same with us -- on the \xe2\x80\x9cWhale,\xe2\x80\x9d a little more on that, 21 million gallons it can scoop up a day.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it sounds like it could be the closest thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to a silver bullet yet if it works.\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you see it that way?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked before about modifying tankers and whether or not we could do that.\xc2\xa0 This is one where they actually went out and modified it.\xc2\xa0 The others, we were waiting to have them modified.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason this one is in the fight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A couple unusual things about working around this well site:\xc2\xa0 First of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s very congested.\xc2\xa0 We can have anywhere between 20 and 30 vessels, a number of ROVs operating around there.\xc2\xa0 Industry would call that simultaneous operations, or SIMOPS.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The oil is only suitable for that type of collection within a few miles of the wellhead itself because that\xe2\x80\x99s when it comes up as a pretty good size slick.\xc2\xa0 It becomes disaggregated after that.\xc2\xa0 So if you have a huge tanker capable of 21-million-gallon capacity chasing down half-mile slicks, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a different type of platform you want to use for it.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to use it right around the well site where it\xe2\x80\x99s got the greatest economy of effort in dealing with the oil and where it can give us the greatest return on investment.\xc2\xa0 I think we just need to see how it works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if I could ask you about unemployment insurance, who\xe2\x80\x99s to blame for Congress leaving town without passing this?\xc2\xa0 And how much of a role did the President play?\xc2\xa0 Did the President aggressively get in there and push for this, or did he leave it to Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- I think last night\xe2\x80\x99s effort was the fourth effort to -- this one was a scaled-back version of unemployment insurance through I believe November, with I think a home tax credit added as well.</p>\n<p>Look, again, this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an example of it takes 60 votes to get something done.\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take 60 votes to get the long-term unemployed -- to make sure that the long-term unemployed do not suffer an interruption in what they need to keep going.\xc2\xa0 It certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any economic sense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we will continue to push Congress and to work with them -- obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- Senator Byrd\xe2\x80\x99s replacement will be at some point back into the voting of all this as well, which obviously is one of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to push forward on this so that\xc2\xa0 -- again, I think if you just look at the economic sense of if you\xe2\x80\x99re an unemployed -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s unemployed, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- we now obviously have the type of chronic long-term unemployment that greatly exceeds the previous worst case, which was in the early \xe2\x80\x9880s.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re well past that.</p>\n<p>If you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about long-term economic growth you have to be worried about the long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0 They are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that if you\xe2\x80\x99re unemployed you\xe2\x80\x99re far more likely to take your benefits and use them to keep going.\xc2\xa0 That money obviously gets into the economy rather quickly.</p>\n<p>So we will continue to push forward on this and try to convince 60 senators -- we got good help last night from two senators from Maine -- to try to get what shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard to get done for the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans say Democrats are just using this as a political issue, they want the issue more than they want the vote, and that the White House is involved in that, too.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, we have -- again, I think if you read any article about the plight of those that are unemployed and have been unemployed for really long periods of time -- we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that like we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it before.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that impacting not just lower-wage, lower-skill jobs; it\xe2\x80\x99s impacting those that have been employed for long periods of time prior to this, that have college educations -- folks, quite frankly, that are not used to being in the pool of what would be in a normal recession considered likely to be long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that in a way that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If they\xe2\x80\x99re worried about the politics of this issue, it seems to me it just makes common sense to ensure that people that cannot find work because the recession that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with is greater than anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with since the Great Depression -- why on Earth would you take a group that has been chronically unemployed and for some reason stop their unemployment benefits?\xc2\xa0 It just -- economically, it makes absolutely no sense at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few weeks ago, one percentage figure that has been used by the President, and I believe you, Admiral Allen, was 90 percent -- a few weeks ago the President said that in a few weeks 90 percent of whatever it is, the gas and the oil, the carbons coming up from the floor, would be capped.\xc2\xa0 Where are we on that?\xc2\xa0 Ninety percent of what?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Ninety percent of the flow coming out of the wellbore right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is what?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, the current estimate is 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day from the last flow rate estimate.\xc2\xa0 Let me walk you through the sequence -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.</p>\n<p>Right now we have three ways to remove oil from that wellbore -- the riser pipe that goes up to the Discovery Explorer [sic], and the choke and the kill lines -- those are the lines we tried to push mud down during the top kill exercise.\xc2\xa0 We are taking oil out of two of those right now.\xc2\xa0 We intend to take oil out of the third, the kill line, with the Helix Producer once the weather calms down.\xc2\xa0 That will take us to a capacity of 53,000 barrels a day.</p>\n<p>Now, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that\xe2\x80\x99s going to do to that picture you see of the imagery with the vents open and the oil.\xc2\xa0 We would like to get that down to where there\xe2\x80\x99s a minimum amount of oil escaping as possible.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s never going to be zero because if it goes to zero that means water could intrude and we\xe2\x80\x99d have a hydrate problem with the capping device.</p>\n<p>BP has proposed, and we are reviewing right now, the placement of a new cap on it, which would -- they would actually unbolt that stub section of pipe that was cut off.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we call -- that wide area is called a flange -- actually unbolt the flange and actually put another containment device on that we bolted on that would ensure a complete seal.\xc2\xa0 And when the President talks of achieving a greater than 90 percent recovery rate, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about with the new capping device.</p>\n<p>They\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to do that in about two to three weeks, and also provide redundant production capability on the surface -- it will take us to 60,000 to 80,000 barrels a day production capacity.</p>\n<p>They did that at our direction because we wanted two things.\xc2\xa0 We wanted redundancy, so if there\xe2\x80\x99s lightning in the area and somebody has to shut down we could keep producing.\xc2\xa0 We wanted additional flexibility to be able to unhook and hook up faster in the event of a hurricane.\xc2\xa0 And we also wanted a risk mitigator against a complete failure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this new device would essentially replace the three that you have online or are about to have online?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 It would allow us to actually run four lines with the new cap, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will the President make the determination on when to approve that second cap?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No decision like that is forthcoming right now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re technically reviewing all of those options right now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Also, to add a little context to what the Admiral said, the hope for the kill line to the Helix was obviously the end of June -- largely around today.\xc2\xa0 Because of weather, equipment had to be taken off of the Enterprise that\xe2\x80\x99s needed for the Helix.\xc2\xa0 So the date for -- which the Admiral said earlier in the briefing -- is sort of midweek next week to bring the kill line to the Helix online that would take us what we believe to a capacity of around 50,000 to 53,000 barrels a day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not 90 percent.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, the 90 percent is achieved with the second cap.[NOTE added to the transcript for clarification: As Admiral Allen clarifies below, by increasing our containment rate to 53,000 barrels per day, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be collecting 90% of the hydrocarbons that are leaking into ocean \xe2\x80\x93 given the current high end of the estimated flow rate.]</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is two or three weeks after what happens next week, right?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Let me be specific here.\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re close on the flow rate, the 35 to 60, we could get there with the 53.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not assured because it\xe2\x80\x99s not a perfect seal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said -- maybe I was confused -- you said that it was -- the bore -- the relief well was in 15 feet of the wellbore, but you said there\xe2\x80\x99s several hundred feet left to bore.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I follow you there.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s within 15 feet, side by side, going down, and it\xe2\x80\x99s slowly getting closer until they\xe2\x80\x99re sure they know exactly where they\xe2\x80\x99re at and they can go in for the kill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a question for you, back to Congress and pending legislation on the war supplemental.\xc2\xa0 House Democrats want to trim I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s $500 million from the President\xe2\x80\x99s Race to the Top program in order to offset the war supplemental.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your feeling about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we -- obviously the President has put a lot of energy, as Secretary Duncan has, into the Race for the Top, which is where this money that Congress is looking to take a part of.\xc2\xa0 Understand this -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we have a little perspective over what Race for the Top has done -- and that is 40 some states that have applied for this have made -- have basically undergone the type of education reform that people had hoped to see in this country for decades.</p>\n<p>That has happened based on the incentive of these investments.\xc2\xa0 We do not believe that taking money out of that important investment makes any sense at all.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear with Congress about the fact that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense at all.\xc2\xa0 I believe we can come to a conclusion on this as we\xe2\x80\x99ve given them additional places to look for cuts that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require taking away from that important investment that has led to fundamental education reform in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can it lead to a veto?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will get to that.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been very clear with the leaders in Congress that that money is a -- is important and is a big priority for this administration.</p>\n<p>Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You and the President both on immigration have made clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Republicans who are blocking this from moving forward.\xc2\xa0 Was one of the purposes of the speech today to make it crystal clear to the people who care about this issue that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 fault this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just the legislative reality that we live in.\xc2\xa0 Again, if you had given that speech three or four years ago, you would likely have -- you all could name the Republicans that you were likely to have seen statements from that supported comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>I mean, the reality, Laura, is that you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get 60 votes.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many Democrats, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get Republicans involved.\xc2\xa0 This is a problem of national significance and it is going to require Republicans to be part of that solution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was this a political purpose, in the sense that you were hoping to direct the anger from the Hispanic community elsewhere?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- look, keep in mind, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s just the Hispanic community that cares about immigration.\xc2\xa0 This is not about directing anybody\xe2\x80\x99s anger.\xc2\xa0 This is about working toward a comprehensive solution.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves having a series of patchwork immigration laws that change every time you see a sign that says \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome\xe2\x80\x9d to a different state.\xc2\xa0 It has to be done in a comprehensive way, and we have to do this together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given that everything he said this morning he has said in one place or another over time -- granted, not all in one speech -- but has said before, and that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, in fact, how did this speech advance anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- because I think we are -- we have talked about immigration reform over the course of the last several weeks mostly as it relates to what is happening in one state, right?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to solve the immigration problem, again, one state at a time or a series of states at a time.\xc2\xa0 This is a topic that has been talked about for many weeks now, and the only way to solve it is once again for Congress to come together, Democrats and Republicans, and pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the homebuyers\xe2\x80\x99 tax break extension going to be signed today as well?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, were you able to get an answer from last week when you were asked about Steny Hoyer suggesting -- considering the possibility of raising the retirement age for Social Security?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Steny Hoyer, or -- that was -- I thought it was -- I was asked about Alan Simpson, was I not?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was Hoyer, also last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hoyer said --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Simpson also --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I went back in the transcript, you were asked about Hoyer.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember being asked about Hoyer.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to look into it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any thought on the five Democrats that voted for the new oil spill commission?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that undercuts the President\xe2\x80\x99s oil spill commission?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, there are -- there has been some suggestion, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s well placed, that somehow the commission that the President set up is too -- is made up of too many sort of pro-environment members.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a commission member from Alaska who has supported drilling in ANWR.\xc2\xa0 The co-director -- the former EPA administrator under George Bush is on leave from the board of Conoco-Phillips.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no way to look at what has happened and what has to move forward in terms of the type of regulatory structure without including voices from industry, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not worried about dueling commissions, or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get this in a place that makes sense moving forward and that gives us a strong report and a good framework, again, for the type of regulation that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to make this type of activity safe again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen, with the State Department announcement a couple of days ago, what can you do now that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do before with the assets that you are now bringing in from outside?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, four to six weeks ago, when we saw the skimmer issue start to emerge and we saw a shifting landscape from booming requirements to skimming requirement, we talked to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 They sent a cable out -- I believe it was around the 13th of June -- actually soliciting input from the countries; a lot of that has come back now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the process where we can screen it, actually do letters of acceptance and we\xe2\x80\x99re moving on that right now.</p>\n<p>We have well over 100 offers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going through them right now.\xc2\xa0 Roughly about 40 of those have been accepted and we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing all those right now.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at everything very, very seriously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So mostly you\xe2\x80\x99re increasing skimmer capacity?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 It will come from three areas, basically.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for any foreign assistance that can be provided.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re actually -- almost all the skimmer production capability in this country now is tied up in the orders we placed out for the next four to six weeks.\xc2\xa0 We have an emergency rulemaking that was announced yesterday that would ease some of the requirements for standby equipment around the country for other operations that could flow those to the Gulf as well.\xc2\xa0 So the combination of those three together are allowing us to mass our skimming forces in the next four weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I read the EPA announcement on dispersants correctly yesterday, they said they\xe2\x80\x99re safe but that there still needs to be more testing of the way the dispersants are interacting with the oil and its composition as it sinks to the bottom of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 The two big deals on dispersants are we\xe2\x80\x99ve never used them in this quantity before, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s subsurface or surface, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve never used them subsurface.\xc2\xa0 And I know Lisa Jackson -- we\xe2\x80\x99re very good friends, we talk about this almost daily.\xc2\xa0 She is concerned -- she understands when there\xe2\x80\x99s an operational imperative of why you need them, and there are times when you do need to do that.\xc2\xa0 But there also is an imperative to do sampling and testing and understand the impacts of the dispersants while they\xe2\x80\x99re being used.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s a tradeoff, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tradeoff operationally and sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a tradeoff on safety, because dispersants reduce volatile organic compounds, which are a workplace problem for the folks that are working on the ships out there.\xc2\xa0 So what we are trying to do is understand more about the dispersants, use this as a learning situation to get more data and where we\xe2\x80\x99re going.\xc2\xa0 And we all generally agree, if we can ratchet down the use of dispersants, focus more on skimming and in-situ burning, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a floor to which we\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to get to because there are opportunities we can\xe2\x80\x99t achieve to mitigate the impact of the oil other than using dispersants.\xc2\xa0 The question is where is that right spot.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet exactly how safe or unsafe and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant environmental tradeoff --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we know the dispersants are less toxic than the oil.\xc2\xa0 And we also know that when you make a decision to use dispersants, you\xe2\x80\x99re deciding to have the fate of the oil and the ultimate impact of the oil be absorbed in the water column, not the shore.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, Major, I would just say that\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to do that type of testing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I understand.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right -- to ensure that -- as the Admiral said, you\xe2\x80\x99re using this in quantities not previously seen.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 The same would apply to air quality monitoring around in-situ burnings and the flaring that\xe2\x80\x99s going on out there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions for you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 You said, the last time I was able to ask you about this, that the final legal language with BP about the $20 billion fund and the $100 million for the -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finalized.\xc2\xa0 Has it been finalized yet?\xc2\xa0 And is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with -- I can check with DOJ.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because Bill had said that you\xe2\x80\x99d release it when it is finalized.\xc2\xa0 Is it finalized?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 A couple of other non-oil spill things.\xc2\xa0 Are you comfortable, Robert, with the way the Romanoff endorsement from former President Clinton went down?\xc2\xa0 And would you be encouraged if there were more direct communication between the former President and the political arm of the White House about things going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good try.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President -- President Clinton has relationships that extend a long time back, and will make endorsements for a whole host of reasons, including that.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I was asked if we had -- if we heard from him prior to that endorsement, and the answer to that was no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you like to in the future?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Before you guys?\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel the need in any way, shape or form, to coordinate these things, or to at least discuss them informally before they\xe2\x80\x99re publicly acknowledged?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I answered that, despite your many attempts at creating a news story.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 The President wants the Bush tax cuts that apply to the middle class to be extended.\xc2\xa0 What is the mechanism by which he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have Congress achieve that before the end of this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with Legislative Affairs on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Lastly, do you expect the supplemental funding to be resolved this week?\xc2\xa0 At least on the House side.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, it certainly our hope is that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously these conversations are intense -- you feel confident about that, you think that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a vote this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They were -- there are conversations that have been had even today on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into whether it\xe2\x80\x99s this week or the first week they\xe2\x80\x99re back.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we think this is something that can be worked out, giving the President and our troops the funding that they need in Afghanistan without taking money away from important investments like Race to the Top.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today with Senator Reid, what he said about the immigration --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have an opportunity to talk about what is going to be on the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s agenda moving forward when they get back.\xc2\xa0 Obviously between now and the end of the year, the Senate will take up and I believe approve Elena Kagan to be the next Supreme Court justice.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re making good progress on ratifying the New START treaty; energy, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about earlier; small business lending and unemployment benefits\xc2\xa0 -- all of that will be on the docket today that they discuss, so largely the agenda moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President asked -- made it clear today that Republicans are the only way this is going to happen if immigration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- he met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus this week and with advocates.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to meet with any particular Republicans in the coming days and weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings that are headed in the future.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he made not too recently a series of calls to five Republicans and continues to be in contact through Legislative Affairs and the chief of staff\xe2\x80\x99s office on how we move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, the President is going to sign this afternoon or this evening the Iran Sanctions Act.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what he expects that to do or why -- what his assessment of that is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this I think -- we have seen over the course of this year, we have seen Treasury make designations regarding activities and doing business with Iran.\xc2\xa0 The United Nations has passed the strongest sanctions on Iran that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\xc2\xa0 We have -- our allies in Europe are working on continuing to make progress.\xc2\xa0 The Congress has weighed in.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the Treasury will continue to work on designations so that we can increase, quite frankly, the pressure on the government of Iran to live up to its commitments and give up its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is -- none of this stuff is a silver bullet, but all of it continues to make progress to give what we believe is far more than sufficient incentive to start to comply.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there things you want the allies to do that would mirror what the Congress has done in that regard?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak directly for them but I know they continue to work on it.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just financial regulatory reform briefly, the President hoped to sign it this week; it\xe2\x80\x99s now going over to next week in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is there any -- or, sorry, till after the break.\xc2\xa0 Is there a danger that you lose votes over that break?\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have another Democratic senator back in place in time to get something done?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, to the next question -- to the last question, yes.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously the events of the passing of Senator Byrd certainly have delayed for the time being the passage of financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that if you go back to January or February or even a few weeks ago, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it was a question of whether this was ever going to come to be.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s now up for any debate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of when.\xc2\xa0 And I think when we get back, the President will -- when the Senate and House get back, I think the President will very quickly have an opportunity to sign the strongest regulations dealing with the financial industry that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen put in place since right after the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, very quickly, have you decided -- are you going to be going back down to the Gulf or have you decided where you can now be most effective at this point in the spill?\xc2\xa0 Are you better used in Washington or is it better for you to be down in the Gulf area?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been about a 50/50 split thus far.\xc2\xa0 Things going on in Washington this week having to do with the meetings with the Cabinet secretaries and BP officials regarding the transition of the systems we talked about earlier.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be down there next week, will be traveling around.\xc2\xa0 I hope to get out to the Helix Producer as it\xe2\x80\x99s hooked up.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll move back and forth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And Robert, can you give us an idea of what the President will be doing over the holiday weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They -- when he returns tomorrow from the funeral, he and the family will travel to Camp David, and then be back for fireworks and such here on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details in terms of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he have guests on the lawn?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we see the President tomorrow on the jobs numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have guests there, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ethan will be here on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like military or something?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the Netanyahu visit on Tuesday and what it will involve, how public it will be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President obviously looks forward to hosting the Prime Minister, who had to cancel a meeting obviously last time.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll host -- discuss a series of important bilateral issues, the implementation of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s recent policy changes in Gaza, regional security, our ongoing proximity talks, and the need and the hope to get quickly to direct talks.\xc2\xa0 The visit I think is scheduled for the 6th and we do have a -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a pool spray there, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I -- some Jewish groups are disappointed that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been to visit Israel yet.\xc2\xa0 Is anything along those lines in the works?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on immigration, one thing the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention in his speech this morning was a temporary guest worker program, which obviously was a big sticking point the last time around and something that business groups say must be part of any compromise now.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he address the idea and does he support a temporary guest worker program that would allow immigrants to come here without being put on an eventual path to citizenship?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you just mentioned is certainly part of the details that are ultimately going to have to be worked out because there are different ways -- if you go back into the debate in \xe2\x80\x9805, \xe2\x80\x9806, and even in \xe2\x80\x9807, there were different ways to structure guest worker programs.\xc2\xa0 Some, as I think you just alluded to in your question, structured it in a way that, come here for a certain amount of time and then go back before coming into the process of potentially staying here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So obviously that is certainly one of the aspects that have to be worked through.\xc2\xa0 The President sat down with Senator Graham and Senator Schumer and applauded their framework in moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And obviously this is part of what would be important for Democrats, Republicans and the President to sit down and start working through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s open to different approaches?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to close the President\xe2\x80\x99s options.\xc2\xa0 What we need is a group on the other side that\xe2\x80\x99s willing and ready to have that meeting.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For both of you, to get back to the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 report about the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s response, spelling aside, their bottom line is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe they can get -- they\xe2\x80\x99re getting straight answers from the government with regard to the positioning of assets, to the point where some are suggesting that the government make available GPS information about where things are down there.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We have put Coast Guard officers with every parish president.\xc2\xa0 We have Coast Guard liaisons for Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.\xc2\xa0 Those liaisons are working down at the county level.\xc2\xa0 I visited there earlier this week with the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 We met with Governor Crist in Florida.\xc2\xa0 These officers are there to cut down on decision time, deploy resources.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a tremendous response on vessels of opportunity that have signed up to get their boats out there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are putting locating devices on that, providing tactical communications, and integrating that with air surveillance.\xc2\xa0 We have partnered with the 1st Air Force and we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken control of the airspace in the Gulf, especially the temporary flight restriction zone over the well site, so we can integrate all that together to make it more effective.\xc2\xa0 Any local leader down there that has a question on asset deployment and priorities just needs to turn to his Coast Guard liaison officer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it in a sense real-time information?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have is this displayed on what we call a common operating picture, and anything that\xe2\x80\x99s got a locating device can be seen on a website.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully this data will become more available as we get it up and operating.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A question for the Admiral and a question for you.\xc2\xa0 Admiral, when you spoke to us at the end of May along with Ms. Browner, you mentioned that a science summit was going to be held at the beginning of June at Louisiana State University.\xc2\xa0 Have they released a report, a white paper, from that summit or can you summarize any of the results?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 It is done.\xc2\xa0 The report is out.\xc2\xa0 If I can follow up and tell where that\xe2\x80\x99s at, we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And Robert, recently Senator Durbin and Congressman Don Manzullo from the President\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Illinois wrote the Pentagon complaining about the bidding process with a contract.\xc2\xa0 It seems as though IDT, a company in Belvidere, Illinois, had been asked to bid on a contract to make protective barriers for troops.\xc2\xa0 And they were turned down and the Defense Logistics Agency promptly asked a British company, Hesco, to rebuild.\xc2\xa0 They filed a complaint with the General Accounting Office and, as I said, two Illinois members of Congress have complained.\xc2\xa0 Is this something the administration is following?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to DOD on this.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the correspondence on this but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look into this with DOD.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One for the Admiral.\xc2\xa0 You said that the onshore skimming activities have been significantly disrupted by this heavy weather.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that more oil than you would normally expect has been coming ashore in the last few days?\xc2\xa0 And given the fact that this was a fairly sort of moderate storm as to what you might expect in hurricane season, has the disruption it\xe2\x80\x99s caused caused you to sort of reexamine the contingencies you might face if there was a more direct hit from a hurricane?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, the surge we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in and around Louisiana has been two to three feet, so there\xe2\x80\x99s some areas where the oil would probably be further in to the beaches or the marsh areas than it would be before.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, weather that gets violent like that has an emulsifying effect and actually breaks up the spill.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they counterbalance each other that well, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll be out there and be able to assess that very, very quickly.</p>\n<p>As it relates to hurricane preparedness, this is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on for well over two months.\xc2\xa0 We understand there are going to be challenges associated with especially with evacuating the wellhead site and the production units that are out there.\xc2\xa0 The number one priority will be safety of life and moving those people far enough ahead of the storm so they don\xe2\x80\x99t get involved with the evacuation of citizens.\xc2\xa0 Our general timeline for dealing with a storm will start at about 120 hours away from when we predict gale-force winds will be at the well site.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen, the last time you were here I asked you a question about the dispersants and the oil and you said over time it would biodegrade and you said you would get back to me as how long it would take for the biodegrading to occur.\xc2\xa0 Do you have that timeline?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We do.\xc2\xa0 And if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get back to you, that\xe2\x80\x99s my apologies -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll get that to you.\xc2\xa0 Jane Lubchenco and NOAA are the ones that are developing that information and we get it from them, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure you get it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have -- do you remember any kind of roundabout time --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, it has to do with actually how the oil has been treated and the fate of the oil.\xc2\xa0 Dispersed oil will biodegrade quicker.\xc2\xa0 Undispersed oil will weather and ultimately -- it all biodegrades, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the metabolic process of the Earth.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of how fast it happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what I was asking at the time, Van Jones, a former green czar here, said that it\xe2\x80\x99s about -- dispersants are not \xe2\x80\x9cdisappearants,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said it goes down and it\xe2\x80\x99s more toxins that go down to the bottom of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 And you said over time it would biodegrade.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Over time the oil will biodegrade -- yes, it will.\xc2\xa0 It will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So maybe 10, 20 years or --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Oh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s much sooner than that.\xc2\xa0 And if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get you the response, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also, Robert, on immigration.\xc2\xa0 The work visa issue has been a contentious point for many, many, many years, even going back to Vicente Fox when he was President of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s stance on the work visa issue?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this was one of the questions that we had earlier.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are a number of different proposals that -- timelines, differences about how long you\xe2\x80\x99re here, whether you go back before you become part of the line.\xc2\xa0 All of those are issues that would need to be worked through, Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what kind of safeguards would be put in place to make sure that some Americans will not be without a job so other people from other countries will get those jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those are the types of things that have been addressed in previous legislation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously one of the things that the President worked on with Senator Grassley was as you get -- obviously as you get work permitting done, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to create a database to ensure that there are not -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not having undocumented workers and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have businesses that are hiring those.\xc2\xa0 All of those, again, are part of the comprehensive proposal that Congress needs to get into.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Solicitor General Kagan seemed to have done very well with all the people grilling her during her confirmation hearings except for one.\xc2\xa0 Arlen Specter thought that the hearings lacked serious substance, were not revealing, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet the standards that Kagan herself had set in the 1995 Chicago University Law article she wrote.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to Senator Specter\xe2\x80\x99s complaints about the quality of the hearings and the information that the Solicitor General --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Senator Specter\xe2\x80\x99s note on that.\xc2\xa0 I know at one point in the hearings on television he said that she was being very forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into discussing cases that you may hear in front of the Supreme Court, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that has -- that\xe2\x80\x99s been the case for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Again, I think she was candid, she was forthcoming, and I think she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be not only approved by the committee but approved by the entire Senate.</p>\n<p>Ken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question for each of you.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen, could you give us an update specifically on the contamination to the fishing grounds?\xc2\xa0 Has it been contained in some areas?\xc2\xa0 Has it spread?\xc2\xa0 Has it gotten worse?\xc2\xa0 Just really from top to bottom where we\xe2\x80\x99re at right now on Gulf fishing and the industry.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 It tends to move around based on the trajectory of the spill and this is something that NOAA has responsibility over through the National Marine Fishery Service.\xc2\xa0 Jane Lubchenco and I and the Vice President met with some fishermen down in the Gulf earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do that did need to happen -- there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a synchronization between the closures of the state of Louisiana, for instance, and how long they gave advance notice when they closed the fishery and what the federal government was doing as far as the advance notice in closing their fishing areas.\xc2\xa0 They now have an agreement and they will do that on the same schedule so it will be the right notice for the fishermen.</p>\n<p>Generally as soon as they can clear an area for fishing, they will do it based on the trajectories.\xc2\xa0 And when they close it, they\xe2\x80\x99ll give a 24-hour advance notice from noon one day till noon the next day.\xc2\xa0 And I believe -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the percentage in front of me right now -- I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s about somewhere around 33 percent of the Gulf that is covered by the closure area right now, but I\xe2\x80\x99d have to confirm that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, some boats have been docked.\xc2\xa0 Has there been an effort or has there been a way to get these ships back into the waters?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, that was a -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific question.\xc2\xa0 We spent a long time in Louisiana at a fish house where the people actually take the crabs and so forth and then ship them out.\xc2\xa0 The gentleman there was on the verge of having to close down because he had not got his claim paid yet to be able to keep operating.\xc2\xa0 Once he closed down, there were 30-some vessels that would not have a place to bring their catch.</p>\n<p>The Vice President spent almost two hours listening to them, talking to them.\xc2\xa0 Some of them choose to try and stay in the fishery and fish where they can.\xc2\xa0 Others want to come into the vessel of opportunity system where they get paid and we use them to deploy boom and do the things out there that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do for spill response.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit mixed about what they really want to do.\xc2\xa0 Right now, a very small percentage are trying to still fish where you can fish.\xc2\xa0 Most of them are opting to go to the vessel of opportunity program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And Robert, on health care reform, there are some reports, there\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence, that as some of the provisions are getting ready to be rolled out, that in some parts of the country, quite frankly, local offices, state and regional offices, are not prepared to handle some of this.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard these reports?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that\xe2\x80\x99s on the radar screen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I have not myself have heard it.\xc2\xa0 I will -- I can certainly see if any of the folks downstairs have.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we rolled out a new website today that allows consumers to get -- put themselves back in control of their own health care through a lot more transparency at healthcare.gov, which provides a ton of information for consumers that are interested.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on the -- thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n2:41 P.M.
