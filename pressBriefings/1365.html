BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some long drives today, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see some beautiful parts of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, at 12:20 p.m., the President is going to tour the facility at POET Biorefining.\xc2\xa0 The remarks will be about 1:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in Macon, Missouri.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to workers about what they\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing during these tough economic times and share ideas for rebuilding our economy in the long term.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack is, again, along with us for the day.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be with us all the way to the White House later on.</p>\n<p>At that event we expect all the statewide officials and the mayor of Macon, Doug Bagley; the general manager of POET Biorefining, Steve Burnett, will lead the tour.</p>\n<p>We will then -- sorry, just a little more on POET.\xc2\xa0 In Macon they produced their first ethanol in May of 2000, starting with an annual production capacity of 15 million gallons.\xc2\xa0 Three years later the plant expanded its capacity to 46 million gallons per year and added the production of Dakota Gold Distillers Grains and carbon dioxide.\xc2\xa0 The Macon facility was the first ethanol plant in the state of Missouri and currently employs 45 people.</p>\n<p>The plant purchases 16 million bushels of corn from 650 local farmers, which annually produces, like I said, 46 million gallons of ethanol, which primarily goes to St. Louis and Palmyra, Missouri, 140,000 tons of high-protein animal feed called Dakota Gold Distillers Grains that\xe2\x80\x99s sold to area farmers, and 94,000 tons of CO2, which is sold to soft-drink companies, food processors, water treatment facilities, to name a few.\xc2\xa0 They also have really cool commercials at POET.</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99ll later have a kitchen table-type discussion with a local farm family to discuss their operation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At 4:00 p.m., we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Quincy, at the Oakley Lindsay Civic Center.\xc2\xa0 You guys might remember in 2008 this was the place where the President went and sandbagged in preparation for the floods.\xc2\xa0 And later he\xe2\x80\x99ll -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s where he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver remarks on Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There will be about 2,000 folks in attendance; 70 percent of the tickets were distributed Tuesday on a first come, first serve basis; the other 30 percent, as per normal, distributed by the White House to local groups and elected officials.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you preview the remarks in Quincy this afternoon, at least a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is going to talk about the fact that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take a degree from the Harvard School of Economics to understand that on Wall Street things are getting back to normal.\xc2\xa0 But if you look around Main Street in rural America, a lot of the places where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been, we\xe2\x80\x99re a far place from a normal that should be acceptable to anyone.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the kind of economic crisis that nearly brought our economy to its knees with the collapse of financial firms and the bailouts that were required, the President firmly believes and will make the case that we need real reforms in place to prevent those sorts of catastrophes from happening again.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the need for Wall Street reform, what it means to Main Street in rural America, and the need to do it right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk about this issue for a long time, and people on both sides are saying that they want to get something done.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s time to act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he getting impatient?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he getting impatient?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President has been impatient on this issue for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 We need action in the Senate to move this forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing a third vote in the Senate, does he have any indication from lawmakers that that vote is going to go any different than the previous two on getting the debate started?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As we took off the conversations were still happening with lawmakers on the Hill, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any further update for you, but that\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he had conversations with lawmakers?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 None that I know of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s people from the administration who have been having conversations with lawmakers.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason Secretary Vilsack didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak at any of the events yesterday?\xc2\xa0 He was governor of Iowa; he seems to be very popular in the state.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No particular reason.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s -- oh, he did actually speak at the pre-programs for some of the events yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, he did?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President call out Charles Grassley, since he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about financial regulation and he was in Iowa yesterday and he voted against the bill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s always a lot of things that the President can say or not say, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the, like, ins and outs of every non-utterance the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we were in Iowa.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We were in Iowa, and it is a fine state.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the Greek debt crisis, which seems to be spreading, and was hitting markets pretty hard yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is something that is of great concern to the President.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring it very closely.\xc2\xa0 And officials from Treasury and other appropriate agencies are in close contact with folks in Europe about the issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there something to be said about the timing of this clean energy push while the Gulf of Mexico is being set on fire, there was this mine disaster related to coal?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been having a -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the midst of real energy problems for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 Our dependence on foreign oil is too much.\xc2\xa0 The amount of emissions that we put out of our vehicles and factories is too high.\xc2\xa0 And this is an issue that the President has been committed to making progress on.</p>\n<p>Like I said yesterday, on the substance, there is bipartisan agreement on what we need to do to move forward to help to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, help to increase our production of clean energies here.\xc2\xa0 And basically we\xe2\x80\x99re just in the midst of a process question.\xc2\xa0 And the President is confident that given the fact that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree on what we need to do to move forward, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to make some very important progress on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the oil rigs off the -- in the Gulf of Mexico?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to affect your offshore drilling policy at all?\xc2\xa0 Is that coming into consideration or play?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a joint investigation currently underway that multiple agencies across the executive branch are participating in.\xc2\xa0 The President is very closely monitoring the situation.\xc2\xa0 People at the highest levels of the administration have been meeting with officials at BP to discuss not just the cleanup there but what happened there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We take very seriously the concerns that people have and the issue that\xe2\x80\x99s -- issues that are underway today in the cleanup and the fire.\xc2\xa0 But the President is eagerly anticipating the outcome of the joint investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you think that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue the push for offshore drilling?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get in front of what the investigation produces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to the Goldman testimony yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on what is ultimately an ongoing enforcement action on the SEC.\xc2\xa0 But like I said earlier, there are real problems on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 There are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to rein in some of the practices that got us into this mess.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a need for more transparency and there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to protect consumers.</p>\n<p>The President is committed to making sure that we make progress and get Wall Street reform done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you seen \xe2\x80\x9cBarack the Barbarian\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I have seen that comic book.\xc2\xa0 I liked it because it had few words and lots of pictures -- made it easy to understand.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But when you come to Iowa you see all sorts of fun things, and it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see the manifestation of somebody\xe2\x80\x99s creative energy in the President slaying a large elephant.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you referring to Sarah the Red?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, the big elephant.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The actual elephant.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n9:55 A.M. CDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
