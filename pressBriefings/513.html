EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon and welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the President will discuss the important economic benefits of raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One century ago in Michigan, Henry Ford famously raised his workers\xe2\x80\x99 pay because he knew it would be good for his business.\xc2\xa0 Now we\'re seeing that many other businesses, like Costco and Gap, do the same thing for their workers.\xc2\xa0 These steps increase productivity, it reduces turnover and it bolsters the bottom line of these businesses.</p>\n<p>Governors across the country are fighting to raise the minimum wage in their states.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has signed an executive order raising the pay of employees for federal contractors.\xc2\xa0 And now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Congress to do their part and to act and raise the minimum wage for everyone else.\xc2\xa0 It would reward hard work and raise the pay of 28 million hardworking Americans, including nearly 1 million people in Michigan alone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re joined on the plane today by Congressman Peters, who is one of the strongest advocates in the United States Congress for legislation that would increase the federal minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll also be joined at the event by Congressman Conyers, also a Congressman from Michigan who also has been a leading advocate for raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 This is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s actually been working on for quite some time throughout his career, and he continues to be a strong advocate for this federal legislation.</p>\n<p>So that will be the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments in Ann Arbor.\xc2\xa0 After that, you know we\'re traveling to Chicago where the President will participate in a couple of fundraising events there.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re looking at for today.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just before we took off there was a Supreme Court ruling lifting overall campaign contribution limits.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did see the reports of that Court ruling.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still reviewing the details of the ruling that was issued today by the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 That said, as noted in those reports, and you may even have seen the arguments, the Solicitor General defended the constitutionality of the Federal Election Commission limits on aggregate campaign contributions.\xc2\xa0 So we are, in fact, disappointed in the decision that was announced today.</p>\n<p>I think Justice Breyer summed up the disappointment rather cogently in his argument when he said that taken together with Citizens United, \xe2\x80\x9ctoday\xe2\x80\x99s decision eviscerates our nation\xe2\x80\x99s campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, since the briefing yesterday there were some developments in the Mideast peace process, so I\'m wondering if you have an update and a response to Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s action.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have something on this.\xc2\xa0 We are disappointed by the unhelpful unilateral actions that both parties have taken in recent days.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry remains in close touch with our negotiating team, which remains on the ground in the region to continue discussions with the parties.\xc2\xa0 But the parties must take the necessary steps if they want to move forward.\xc2\xa0 Tit-for-tat actions and reactions are counterproductive and don\'t serve anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is these are very difficult challenges.\xc2\xa0 We have seen President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu already make some important decisions and take some courageous steps to try to move this process forward.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, these are decisions and steps that the United States can\'t impose on either side.\xc2\xa0 These are not decisions that the United States or members of the Obama administration or other world leaders can make.\xc2\xa0 These are only decisions that can be made and steps that can be taken by the Israeli Prime Minister and the leader of the Palestinian people.</p>\n<p>That has been the case from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 What the United States and what President Obama and, of course, Secretary Kerry have tried to do is to facilitate the efforts of both sides to try to find some common ground.\xc2\xa0 That is a painstaking effort.\xc2\xa0 That is something that many others have tried and failed to do.\xc2\xa0 But this administration and the President and certainly the Secretary of State have not allowed those difficult challenges to dampen our efforts to make progress on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is in the interest of the world for the Palestinians and the Israelis to try to resolve their differences peacefully.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s clearly in the national security interest of the United States, and it is the view of this administration that it\'s also in the clear interests of our allies, the Israelis, and our friends, the Palestinians, to resolve this.\xc2\xa0 There is a path for us to diplomatically find a way for there to be a safe, secure Jewish state of Israel existing alongside an independent, secure Palestinian state as well.\xc2\xa0 That is the ultimate goal, and that is something that we\'re going to continue to strive for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you\'re getting more and more criticism, including from The New York Times editorial page, about using John Jonathan Pollard as a bargaining chip in the Mideast. What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about that right now?\xc2\xa0 And what is your reaction to the criticism?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that Jay got a couple of questions about this in the briefing yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Our position on this has not changed; the President has not made a decision about Mr. Pollard.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is Mr. Pollard was tried and convicted of very serious crimes.\xc2\xa0 He was sentenced to a rather lengthy prison sentence and he continues to serve it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything to say about the situation beyond that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in the speech today will there be any new parts to the minimum wage message, or will the talking points be the same as what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in previous appearances?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to the opportunity to make this case once again.\xc2\xa0 There is a clear, strong economic benefit for us to orient our federal policy around a core American value, which is that hard work should be rewarded.\xc2\xa0 Currently, there are families in this country -- there are individuals in this country who are trying to raise a family of four by working 40 hours a week and getting paid only the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 That means that person who is getting up and working a full day and trying to raise a family is doing so below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 That should be unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 Setting aside partisan and ideological differences, somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s getting up and working 40 hours a week to try to support a family of four should not be raising that family below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is why the President believes we need to reorient our federal policy in a way that we are rewarding hard work.\xc2\xa0 The benefit here is that it\xe2\x80\x99s also good for the economy, and it would be good for business, it would be good for the broader economy, and it would be more fair not just to minimum-wage workers but that segment of workers that also make just above minimum wage -- they\xe2\x80\x99d experience a bump in their pay, too.\xc2\xa0 That puts more money in the pockets of workers and that\xe2\x80\x99s money that we know that will be injected directly into the economy.</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of reasons to support a higher minimum wage and you can expect the President to make -- to present the full complement of arguments in favor of raising the minimum wage at the event today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the President\xe2\x80\x99s first stop with a Senate candidate for 2014?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw that in a couple of the reports.\xc2\xa0 I think that there have been other Democratic Senate candidates who have attended events, but off the top of my head --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This one seems pretty big and public and sort of -- there will be screaming people there and -- it seems sort of campaign-like.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you draw that assessment after you see the event.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Peters is a member of the congressional delegation from Michigan and is a very strong advocate of the United States Congress for raising the federal minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s working with the President on this issue. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to Congressman Peters about it, but I think he would agree with what I said to Angela about making this case. And so we certainly welcome his support and we welcome the support of everybody in Congress who\xe2\x80\x99s in favor of raising the minimum wage to $10.10.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that Congressman Conyers will be at the event as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, in terms of what factor or what role this will play in the campaign, truthfully, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been watching the Michigan Senate campaign very closely so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much this is being debated there.\xc2\xa0 I hope it is a lot.\xc2\xa0 But there certainly is a good opportunity for Democratic candidates if they choose to talk about this on the stump because the value of raising the minimum wage aligns very cleanly with the vision that the President has articulated and that many Democrats agree with that hard work should be rewarded; that we need to be looking for ways that we can expand economic opportunity for everybody, particularly those who are in the middle class and trying to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that is a good opportunity for us to bring the kind of change to Washington that the President himself ran on when he decided to run for President in 2007.</p>\n<p>So this has been the culmination of a long fight that the President has been waging.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see that there are a lot of Democrats who are supporting this policy.\xc2\xa0 There should be a lot of Republicans who should support this policy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point out that the last time the federal minimum wage was increased it was signed into law by a Republican President.\xc2\xa0 So there should be some Democratic support around this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it will be a part of campaigns.\xc2\xa0 I would understand why Democratic candidates choose to make it a focal point of their campaign -- that\'s a decision they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s also easy for me to see why a lot of Republicans would quickly get onboard.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll wait and see whether or not that happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would Congressman Peters come talk to us, do you think? Is there a chance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention it to him.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an initiative campaign.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re gathering signatures.\xc2\xa0 I know they\xe2\x80\x99ll be gathering signatures outside of the event on the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to talk about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a little bit about this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a position on that referendum.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s actually not -- as you point out, it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ballot yet.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take a look at that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just quickly, how many college campus visits is this for him this year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many he\xe2\x80\x99s done this year.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done a few.\xc2\xa0 College campuses have a built-in audience, which is helpful.\xc2\xa0 They also have facilities that can host large crowds.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re also talking about an issue that I think will resonate with a lot of college students.\xc2\xa0 This issue of rewarding the hard work is a basic American value and a lot of kids who are putting themselves through college right now are hoping that that hard work is going to pay off for them.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to see a lot of enthusiastic college students at the event today heartily agreeing with what the President has to say about raising the federal minimum wage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the speech today, do you feel like a sense of momentum is changing on this?\xc2\xa0 The President has been talking about it for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Has the politics changed in Washington?\xc2\xa0 Is the public more on the side of raising the minimum wage?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s changed since the President is talking about this so much?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do think we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that public support is building behind the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some polling data to indicate that.\xc2\xa0 Whether that translates directly into action in Congress remains an open question.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we have been building public support for other issues on which Congress has refused to take action is not news to any of you.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.</p>\n<p>The President is going to continue to make the case across the country about why the minimum wage should be increased.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been pleased to see that there have been leaders in the private sector who have taken action to raise wages for their workers.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very supportive of the efforts of some governors across the country to fight to raise the minimum wage in their states.\xc2\xa0 The President did an event in Connecticut a few weeks ago now where he stood with governors from four New England states who are advocating for an increase in the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 The President himself has taken unilateral action to raise the minimum wage that\xe2\x80\x99s paid to the employees of federal contractors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President is pushing on this on a range of fronts.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage Congress to take action, but the President is not going to wait for them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a local election in D.C.\xc2\xa0 As a D.C. resident, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is aware of Muriel Bowser winning the Democratic nomination for mayor, which likely means she will be mayor, and if he has formed an impression of her at all in his time in D.C.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do know that the President is aware of the election results from last night in the District of Columbia.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President has ever met Councilwoman Bowser or not.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President and the White House values the strong working relationship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with a couple of mayors in the District of Columbia and whoever the next mayor is, we\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate that that strong working relationship will continue.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that the President will support the winner of the Democratic primary of that contest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, when he was endorsed by Mayor Fenty early on, I think in 2007, pledged to do some stumping for D.C. voting rights, support it strongly.\xc2\xa0 Will we see in the next two years the President will pick that up, that case up again at all? We haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard much about it from the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had the opportunity to talk about it recently, but his passion for ensuring that residents of the District of Columbia have representation in the United States Congress has not waned at all.\xc2\xa0 That is a goal that the President continues to believe should be enacted.\xc2\xa0 And like I said, the President will work with whomever the next mayor of D.C. is to try to further that goal.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, the President is hopeful that the Democratic candidate will be the one that takes office for the next term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President is going to sign a disaster declaration in the state of Washington for the landslides instead of just the emergency declaration that\xe2\x80\x99s been called?\xc2\xa0 That way it frees up more resources.\xc2\xa0 Is there more that the President can do than just that declaration, and is that going to be signed soon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that our emergency management folks at FEMA and DHS have been in touch with local officials in the state of Washington to try to assist them as they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with what is a tragic situation.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President talk about this during his trip to Europe, about our support for the community that\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with a really significant challenge and a really tragic loss.</p>\n<p>In terms of the administrative steps that the President needs to take to provide support to the people of Washington, I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you an update on that.\xc2\xa0 We can check on that when we get on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say the President and members of his team stand ready to provide federal support as they work to recover from that terrible situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question totally off -- a different subject.\xc2\xa0 In the Ukraine, Democratic Congressman Schiff just returned from a trip to Ukraine, and he put out a statement calling our policy too cautious and that it could possibly be read by some, including Putin, as being weak.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any kind of -- as a sign of weakness.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to his statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would encourage you and the American people to judge for yourselves the strength of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response.\xc2\xa0 And when you look at the sanctions that have been put in place against individuals who were supported by the Russian government and at least one entity that is supportive of the Russian government, those were sanctions that have exacted an economic toll on the country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the currency be devalued, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a decline in the stock market since those sanctions were put in place.</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry appeared with his counterparts at a NATO summit just yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian foreign minister was in attendance as well.\xc2\xa0 At that conference, we saw additional commitments from our NATO allies to our collective Article 5 responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The United States has made a couple of commitments.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve shipped six F-15s to the Baltics to assist in the air patrol mission there.\xc2\xa0 A dozen F-16s from the United States were sent to Poland to assist in defense efforts that are underway in Poland. The USS Truxton extended its deployment in the Black Sea.\xc2\xa0 There are additional resources that are headed to the Black Sea from the U.S. Navy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So if you look at the sanctions that were put in place, the strong statements from our allies, the additional commitments from our allies, the concrete movements of our defense infrastructure to our allies in Europe, it should be pretty clear to every observer that the U.S. resolve is strong in this situation.\xc2\xa0 And NATO stands ready to assert the defense of our allies and to support the legitimate government of Ukraine against the violation of their territorial integrity that they\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced and some of the threatening provocative actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Russian military just on the other side of the border of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The big story of the day in Michigan is, of course, the GM recalls.\xc2\xa0 Given the government support of GM, is the President satisfied with the response of the company so far on that situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We did have some language on that this morning.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved ones in these tragic accidents.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s critical that we get to the bottom of what happened here and what can be done to prevent similar tragedies in the future.\xc2\xa0 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- or NHTSA -- has opened a formal investigate to whether GM shared the information they had about this issue as quickly as they should.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Foxx has also asked the inspector general of the Department of Transportation to conduct an audit to provide a single, comprehensive review of NHTSA\xe2\x80\x99s work in this case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\'t want to get ahead of either of these investigations on the specifics of the situation, so at this point I\xe2\x80\x99d just refer you to the Department of Transportation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are we on this plane?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was faster than driving to Ann Arbor.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on this plane -- I have some language on this too actually, the VC-25 is undergoing some routine maintenance, so we\xe2\x80\x99re traveling on the C-32 today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long does routine maintenance take?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not long.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was the answer two weeks ago, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have two of the big ones?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, don\'t they have two?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually that routine maintenance that<br/>\n\t-- they took the VC-25 to Europe and to Saudi Arabia and back, so there was some additional maintenance that needed to be done this week.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the VC-25 will be back in service next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t there two of those planes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are two.\xc2\xa0 The way they are -- the Air Force can give you a more technical, detailed, maybe more confidence-inspiring explanation of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But there are two.\xc2\xa0 One of them is in a longer maintenance rotation.\xc2\xa0 So the one that we have been using recently and the one that the President traveled on when he traveled to Europe and Saudi Arabia is just in for shorter-term routine maintenance.\xc2\xa0 That should take -- but it is our hope that that maintenance will be completed in time for any travel that may be on the horizon next week.\xc2\xa0 Actually, you already know the travel that\'s on the horizon for next week.\xc2\xa0 The President is traveling to Texas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think by the Asia trip, for sure, would be good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that would be good.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that would be -- you don\'t want to travel across the Pacific Ocean in this plane?\xc2\xa0 I see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going to be on the charter.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Anything else, guys?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:24 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
