Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:25 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Happy Monday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an announcement at the top, so I\'ll go straight to Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President has been making a lot of calls to foreign leaders to assess the situation in Crimea, and I\'m wondering if he believes that there is still an opportunity to stop the referendum that\'s scheduled for Sunday from going forward, or if the focus is just on getting the international community to basically delegitimize the results of that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the conversations the President has been having with leaders across the world about the situation in Ukraine and Crimea have focused not just on the referendum -- which we do not view as legitimate under the Ukrainian constitution and which hardly anyone else views as legitimate under the Ukrainian constitution -- but on the broader effort to be united in calling for de-escalation and for a peaceful resolution to this crisis.</p>\n<p>We have been working with our partners to make clear to the Russians that there is an avenue available to them that would allow for an international effort to monitor and ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected, including ethnic Russians and that, therefore, any reasoning that their military intervention was necessary to protect the rights of ethnic Russians becomes defunct, as if it were ever -- even if it were ever valid, which it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So those troops should go back to their bases.\xc2\xa0 Russia ought to engage with the Ukrainian government in dialogue with international participation and they should agree to a process whereby international monitors can go to Ukraine and all parts of Ukraine, including Crimea, to monitor the situation there so that the rights of every Ukrainian are protected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just in terms of the referendum itself, there\xe2\x80\x99s seven days until this happens.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that there\xe2\x80\x99s any prospect of getting that -- pulling that back, have that not happen?\xc2\xa0 Or is that basically going to go forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t predict the future.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that it will not be viewed by the United States as legitimate because it is inconsistent with the Ukrainian constitution, which makes clear that any change in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s borders has to be decided by all of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And other countries have made clear that they would view it as illegitimate as well.</p>\n<p>So Russia needs to avail itself of the opportunity here to work with international partners and the government of Ukraine to resolve this issue diplomatically and peacefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the calls the President made is to President Xi of China.\xc2\xa0 China frequently sides with Russia, particularly at the U.N., to block initiatives by the West.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal here in his conversations with China?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any expectation that China would publicly oppose Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that among the calls the President has made, he did speak with President Xi, and the two leaders agreed on the importance of upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, there is no argument, or should be no argument, that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity were violated by Russia.\xc2\xa0 So every leader the President has spoken to about this matter agrees that we need to take steps together, working with the Russians and the Ukrainians, to resolve this diplomatically in a way that protects those principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything specific that the U.S. is asking of China, just given their relationship with Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a further readout of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 China obviously plays a very important role in the Security Council and does have an important relationship with Russia, but the principles here are inviolable and they are starkly clear.\xc2\xa0 There is no murky aspect to this.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that everyone the President spoke to this weekend, including leaders of the United Kingdom and France and Germany and the Baltic nation states, were in agreement that these principles are key and that we need to resolve this in a way that is peaceful and diplomatic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the referendum goes forward, what will the U.S. reaction be beyond calling it illegitimate?\xc2\xa0 Will there be new sanctions?\xc2\xa0 What exactly?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would note to you, Steve, that the executive order the President signed created authorities which are very flexible and will allow for action to be taken that holds people accountable for the transgressions listed in the executive order when it comes to violations of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity, both leading up to now and into the future.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- as we talked about last week, the executive order itself does not designate individuals, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that, but we are actively engaged in examining the ways that those authorities can be used and would obviously have available to us that executive order and the flexibility it provides to take further action as events on the ground demand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President has now talked to Putin several times.\xc2\xa0 The last time, he outlined the diplomatic off-ramp that you guys put together.\xc2\xa0 Are you getting anywhere with him on that?\xc2\xa0 Is he thinking about it, considering it?\xc2\xa0 Is outright rejection?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously very clear that we and many others profoundly disagree with statements from Russian leaders about the facts on the ground.\xc2\xa0 The assertions of lawlessness in Eastern Ukraine, of violence or other acts being perpetrated against ethnic Russians in Eastern Ukraine or in Crimea simply haven\xe2\x80\x99t been borne out by the facts or any credible reporting.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the only transgressions that have been documented have been ones by the Russian military.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to the conversations that the President has had and the Secretary has had with his counterparts, we are making clear to Moscow that we understand that Russia has legitimate interests in Ukraine, not least, of course, the Black Sea Fleet, but also concerns about ethnic Russians and we recognize those concerns.\xc2\xa0 We commend the Ukrainian government for their responsible handling of this crisis and for the fact that they, too, maintain a commitment to protecting and observing the rights of all Ukrainian citizens.</p>\n<p>We are happy to work with the Russian government and international partners to make sure that there are monitors on the ground in Crimea and in other parts of Ukraine to make sure that ethnic Russians have their rights protected and that any violation of those rights would be reported internationally.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to address these concerns if those are the concerns that motivated the Russian government to take action that\xe2\x80\x99s in clear violation of international law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separately, the Malaysian plane crash.\xc2\xa0 As the early days of efforts have happened, are you in a position to rule out terrorism as the cause of this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to comment on the causes of this incident.\xc2\xa0 The United States government is in communication with agencies and with -- across agencies, rather -- and with international partners to provide any appropriate assistance in the investigation.\xc2\xa0 Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are en route to the region to provide any necessary assistance.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the families affected by this tragic incident.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the State Department has said that there were three American citizens on board and, of course, many more from around the world, especially China, Taiwan and Malaysia.\xc2\xa0 Also, as I think you probably know, the DOD said over the weekend that the Seventh Fleet has sent assets to assist in search efforts, including the USS Pinkney, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, which is now in the vicinity and has two MH-60R helicopters equipped for search efforts onboard.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, a P-3C Orion aircraft from our base in Okinawa is now in the region and has long-range search radar and communications capabilities.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re providing assistance.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Malaysians have the lead in this investigation, but we do not have enough information at this time to comment on the cause.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that you announced over the weekend that Prime Minister Yatsenyuk is coming to the White House on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s message by bringing him here?\xc2\xa0 Are you trying to send a message to President Putin?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re making it clear to the new government of Ukraine that we support them, that we support the responsible way in which Ukrainian officials and the parliament and the new government have handled this crisis, and that we are working to provide direct assistance to Ukraine in this difficult time so that they can stabilize their economy and return to economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the message we\xe2\x80\x99re sending.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to the meeting and I think it will reinforce the fact that the United States believes that the Ukrainian government has responsibly filled the vacuum left by the sudden, hasty and voluntary departure by President Yushchenko [Yanukovych] right after signing this agreement with the opposition.</p>\n<p>So we are working with Congress to provide assistance to the Ukrainian government that would complement an IMF package of assistance.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously working aggressively on the diplomatic front to try to resolve this crisis, working directly with Ukrainian officials, Russian officials, and obviously all the other leaders across Europe that have been engaged in this effort, as well as elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he said just recently, it may have been in the last 24 hours, we won\xe2\x80\x99t budget a single centimeter from Ukrainian land, in reference to the referendum in Crimea and attempts by Russia to annex that land.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned that things could unravel and get out of control after this referendum is held?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that actions taken by Russia have precipitated a crisis.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is it is up to the Ukrainian people through their representatives in government to make decisions about the disposition of any territory within the sovereign state of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly long past the time when borders of a nation can be redrawn above the heads of democratically elected leaders by another state, working in concert with a region of the sovereign state.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made our views on this very clear.\xc2\xa0 We are far from alone in our views on this.\xc2\xa0 And our focus right now is on a diplomatic effort to encourage a dialogue with international partners between the Russian and Ukrainian governments, the moving back to their bases of all Russian forces, and a process by which international monitors could evaluate the concerns expressed by Russian officials over the circumstances of ethnic Russians in parts of Ukraine, including Crimea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President at all concerned that the Europeans might not back him up?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s authorized sanctions, he\xe2\x80\x99s -- the State Department has issued travel restrictions.\xc2\xa0 If the Europeans don\xe2\x80\x99t follow suit, don\xe2\x80\x99t you lack some teeth in what you try to do here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very pleased with the international effort thus far, the cooperative effort that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 The President has been leading that effort and has obviously, as you know from all the readouts, been spending a great deal of time on the phone with leaders across the region and the world.\xc2\xa0 And Europe has taken action already and, as I said with regard to the executive order that the President signed last week, we\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating actions that that authority allows us to take when it comes to sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And that will -- that process will continue depending on the situation on the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like everybody -- it sounds like the President has lined up a fair number of allies here, a fair number of countries to support and -- I guess at least from a diplomatic standpoint.\xc2\xa0 But how can you be assured the Europe is going to be there when it comes to sanctions, though?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to predict the future, or speak for European governments or leaders.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that there has been a broad consensus when it comes to our shared views about what has happened in Ukraine, what has happened in Crimea, the illegality of the actions taken by Russia, the fact that any referendum as scheduled in Crimea that might take place would not be legal under the Ukrainian constitution and therefore would not be recognized by the United States or our allies and partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re working aggressively with our partners on a diplomatic solution, as well as on actions to hold people accountable for what\xe2\x80\x99s transpired.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied with that effort, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage very aggressively with our allies and partners.</p>\n<p>Let me move around a little bit.</p>\n<p>Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 So to get Europe on board, following Jim, on economic sanctions, lo and behold it seems that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economic tentacles have stretched much further into Europe, even the United States, as many had anticipated.\xc2\xa0 Much of it has to do with fossil fuels -- gas, oil.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration doing to expedite the ability of Eastern Europe to wean themselves away from Russian natural resources?\xc2\xa0 What can be done in the short term?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the administration is taking immediate steps to assist Ukraine, and that includes in the area of energy security, energy efficiency and energy sector reform.\xc2\xa0 And at this point I would add that there has been no interruption of oil and natural gas exports from Russia to Ukraine and Europe.\xc2\xa0 European gas inventories are well above normal levels due to a milder than usual winter in Europe and could replace a loss of Russian exports for several months if necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, because this has been a much discussed topic, that any disruption to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s energy shipments to Ukraine, and through Ukraine to Europe, is a lose-lose situation for everyone, most particularly for Russia.\xc2\xa0 Russia is heavily dependent on Europe and Ukraine as critical export markets for its natural gas, earning some $50 billion per year through these sales.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the other part of your question and what the U.S. can do, any actions the United States can take with our own exports and how that would affect markets, that\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated process and more of long-term proposition.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly take the energy security of our friends in Europe very seriously and will continue to monitor the situation closely, including whether there are sanctions we can and should consider taking domestically that would be in both U.S. -- not sanctions, sorry -- actions that would be in both U.S. and European interests.</p>\n<p>On the question -- I think I spoke to this last week -- on the question of LNG exports, DOE obviously has the regulatory authority over that and approves permits, so I would refer you to them for that and for more detail about that process, which is more of a long-term proposition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the short term, it sounds like you\'re saying that Europe, and Eastern Europe in particular, can do without the product, what comes through that pipeline through Ukraine.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is that there are additional reserves because of the warmer-than-usual winter in Europe.\xc2\xa0 And there is an enormous cost to any potential cutoff or reduction in supply of Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine, or to Ukraine, because Russia has a substantial financial interest in maintaining those exports.</p>\n<p>And let\xe2\x80\x99s look more broadly at the negative effect that these transgressions have had on the Russian economy, on the ruble, on the market there -- and on the willingness of international investors to look to make investments in Russia.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of investments depend on stability and reliability and rule of law, and the kinds of actions that we\'ve seen taken by the Russian government when it comes to Crimea are hardly reassuring on those fronts.</p>\n<p>So the costs here are substantial for Russia.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it makes so much sense for Russia to avail itself of the opportunity to work together with the international community and the Ukrainian government to address Russia\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about ethnic Russians and Russian interest in Crimea.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Jim, does the administration think this referendum is possibly a moment in which this situation could reach a turning point?\xc2\xa0 Meaning if there\xe2\x80\x99s a referendum and it would insight some more fervor, if you will, among ethnic Russians, saying, we\'ve had a referendum, we\'ve established our \xe2\x80\x9cindependence\xe2\x80\x9d -- is that something that needs to be averted to calm this crisis down?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think the referendum itself, even if we don\'t recognize it, will have a practical effect on the ground that could make this situation, bad enough as it is, worse?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t make those kinds of predictions.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t pretend to know the future.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the actions taken that are illegitimate by the legislative authority -- body in Crimea and in the scheduling of a referendum, which would not be valid under the Ukrainian constitution, certainly don\'t add to the effort to resolve this diplomatically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\'m trying to get at is it something that the administration should -- believe should be headed off and is trying to work in a way to head it off in order to make this situation -- prevent it from getting worse?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to work very aggressively with our partners and with the Russian and Ukrainian governments to resolve this diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 And so it\'s not just to avert a referendum that would not be viewed as legitimate, the results of which would not be viewed as legitimate, but to resolve the entire situation and to resolve the crisis atmosphere that\'s been created around it.</p>\n<p>I mean, I take your point and I think that\'s reflected in some of the other questions that these actions certainly don\'t serve the cause of trying to resolve this crisis diplomatically and peacefully.\xc2\xa0 But our goal is not just to avert a referendum. It\xe2\x80\x99s to resolve this for the long term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How significant do you regard the joint statement about the call to President Xi of China about sovereignty and territorial integrity? Do you believe that is nudging the Chinese off of position of equivocation or neutrality on this and more in the orbit of the United State?\xc2\xa0 And does that become a prelude for action at the Security Council to in some formal way have the international community, even though Russia would inevitably veto it, try to take some action to condemn this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to game that out.\xc2\xa0 What the President has been trying to do is reach all of our partners and allies across the region and the world to discuss the situation in Ukraine, to discuss our views when it comes to the sanctity and inviolability of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity, to discuss the steps that we, the international community, can take to help resolve this crisis diplomatically, working with Russia and Ukraine -- to allow for international monitors, for example, to assess the situation on the ground when it comes to the rights of all Ukrainians.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of conversations we\'re having.</p>\n<p>And I think that nations across the world and leaders across the world recognize the need to put in place a process by which this can be resolved, that allows for Russia to have its real interests taken seriously by the international community and the Ukrainian government, but that averts a situation like you have now, where a nation -- a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s -- a sovereign nation\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity has been compromised, where there has been a military intervention that is not legitimate, that is not in keeping with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s obligations through a variety of international agreements, including directly with Ukraine, or in keeping with its obligations under the U.N. Charter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How interested is the President in having an alternative G7 summit outside -- or maybe in Europe or here as a demonstration not only of isolation of Russia, but cohesion among the original or the original plus-one, not plus-two members?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we, like our G7 partners, have agreed to halt preparation for a G8, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of a process that is focused on getting --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but those conversations are happening.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute that.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is, no one is preparing for a G8 right now because of the actions that Russia has taken, and it just so happens that Russia is meant to host the G8 this year.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how this transpires, but absent any preparations it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a G8 happening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two topics.\xc2\xa0 On climate change, Senate Democrats are having an all-nighter to talk up the issue.\xc2\xa0 A two-parter:\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support this?\xc2\xa0 Think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to get folks talking about an important issue you want on the radar? Number one.\xc2\xa0 But, number two, is there some expectation by the President that at the end of the talk there will be some sort of a vote, there will be some sort of an action on climate change this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We absolutely support the action taken to focus attention on the challenges posed by climate change and the impacts that climate change is having on our environment and on our emergency -- our ability to respond to emergencies.\xc2\xa0 And so we commend those who are participating, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important subject that the President, as you know, is concerned about and has a Climate Action Plan dedicated to addressing.\xc2\xa0 And he has taken steps in his first term and again in his second term, and will continue to take steps to both reduce our carbon emissions and to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re more prepared for the effects and impacts of severe weather, for example, which is a byproduct of the climate change that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Health care -- you announced kicking off a campaign this week called \xe2\x80\x9cMom Knows Best\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on getting women and moms in particular to sign up for the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care plan.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were counting on nobody taking issue with that, but go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking issue with \xe2\x80\x9cMom Knows Best.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But women voted for the President in large numbers.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one of the reasons why he got reelected.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been reaching out to women for years.\xc2\xa0 Why are you still struggling to get women and moms, who seem to support the President, to sign up for this law?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re calling on moms to reach out to their adult children, get them off the couch and on the computer to enroll, and make sure that they have quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 Because obviously, as you know -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this conversation a lot -- a lot of young folks, because they\'re young and healthy today, think they\'re invincible and are not fully aware of the need to have quality, affordable health insurance because they\'re an accident away or an illness away from needing it very much.</p>\n<p>So that\'s -- the effort revolves around --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting their kids --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the authority, the unique authority that mothers have with their family members to help carry the message.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, there was some reporting by Jon Ralston out in Nevada that a union out there, UNITE HERE, which represents over 200,000 service workers, put together a memo about the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care law and said they\'re worried that one of the biggest challenges in terms of making income inequality worse is the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care law because they think it\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to push down wages for some of these union workers and is going to actually increase their health care premiums.</p>\n<p>When Republicans make that allegation, you push back on it. Are you going to listen when a union says, we think this is going to make income inequality worse, when the President is saying he wants to take care of that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this issue, and the fact is, as the Treasury Department issued in a letter, making it clear that it does not see a legal way for individuals and multi-employer group health plans to receive individual market tax credits, as well as the favorable tax treatment associated with employer-provided health insurance at the same time, but the administration encouraged multi-employer plans and other nonprofit plans to offer coverage through the marketplace on an equal footing to create new, high quality, affordable options for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re -- that\'s what the effort is all about, and we\xe2\x80\x99re making that clear in this way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how do you react to unions that support this White House in general saying health premiums for their workers are going up and wages are going down?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get you more information on this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed it many times.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re working to make sure that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why do they keep saying it then, if you\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are the unions saying it, not the Republicans.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you want to speak for the unions, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll get more information for you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The view from the ground in Crimea, and knowing President Putin, as this White House does, do you agree with your former head of the Defense Department, Bob Gates, when he says that Crimea is lost, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no visible way of seeing that Putin would return on his own?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that it is up to the people of Ukraine to decide their future.\xc2\xa0 And for any kind of decision to be made about the status of a region of Ukraine, only the people of Ukraine and their representatives can have that discussion and make that decision.</p>\n<p>So what I can tell you is that the actions taken thus far are in violation of international law.\xc2\xa0 This referendum that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about if it were to be carried out, its results would not be recognized by the United States or most nations across the country.\xc2\xa0 And as the executive order signed by the President makes clear, we have put in place authorities to take actions, via sanctions, against those who are viewed as responsible for the violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty.</p>\n<p>So there are costs, as the President made clear very early, to those responsible, and, more broadly, as I was talking about earlier with Mr. Viqueira, to Russia economically for pursuing this path.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a crystal ball, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read into the future, especially when it comes to actions that President Putin or Russia might take.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that there is a broad consensus internationally about the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, about the need to resolve this diplomatically and peacefully and by the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a path here that is available for Russia to pursue that would allow for their interests, legitimate interests, to be recognized and taken seriously, for the concerns they have to be assessed and addressed.\xc2\xa0 And we very much encourage Russia to avail itself of that opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, right now the previously unmarked line between Crimea and Ukraine, according to Western independent journalists, there appears to be a fence or even land mines in the eyes of people on the ground there going up to separate Crimea from what is largely viewed as Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any comment on that?\xc2\xa0 Is it aware of that?\xc2\xa0 Is it concerned by that report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we monitor all the events going on in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine quite closely, as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that this is 2014, and we are long past the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of elected governments, over the heads of the people and their elected officials.\xc2\xa0 And we will not and do not recognize as legal the actions that have been taken or might be taken with this referendum.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are where we are.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we are engaged in the aggressive diplomatic effort that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in, working with our European partners and other partners.\xc2\xa0 And, again -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do it in shorthand -- Russia has a way here, they have an off-ramp here that respects the fact that they have legitimate interests in Ukraine, that acknowledges that there are ethnic Russians about whom Russia has concerns.\xc2\xa0 And there is an opportunity here, through the OSCE or the United Nations, to ensure that non-partial international observers are on the ground monitoring the situation so that the rights of all Ukrainians are respected and protected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the desire in terms of the negotiations and the conversations taking place between the administration and Russia behind the international monitors is to look out for the safety, as the Russians suggest, of ethnic Russians in these locations.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s new reporting that Russian supporters have been attacking pro-Ukrainian demonstrators and others.\xc2\xa0 So what can be done to protect not the ethnic Russians, but those who support one united Ukraine in those situations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I was noting, the international monitors would be in place to make assessments about the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Russia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let them in to protect their own people?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY: -- the protection of all Ukrainians, not just ethnic Russians.\xc2\xa0 But that is the purported reason that Russia has taken the action that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken in violation of international law, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re emphasizing the point about ethnic Russians.</p>\n<p>We are also, as we talked about earlier, working directly with the government of Ukraine to help support the government of Ukraine through bilateral assistance and through our efforts to complement a package of assistance the IMF can provide to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of strengthening the Ukrainian state and its ability to handle its own affairs, we are actively engaged in that effort as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly, the point being the Russian troops are there because they say they need to protect the ethnic Russians. I guess, who\xe2\x80\x99s there protecting those people who support Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, Ukraine has its own local and national security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or Crimeans.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about all of the individual reports, but any violation of the rights of Ukrainian citizens, especially encouraged by Russian military forces, is obviously a concern.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more domestic politics question quickly.\xc2\xa0 What has the President done for Alex Sink?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President supports Democratic candidates across the country.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has been engaged in an effort and will continue to be engaged in an effort to support the Democratic National Committee, the DS -- the senatorial committee and the congressional committee.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just specifically, the election is tomorrow, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious what in particular the President has been doing as an asset to his campaign.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the President is focused on an agenda that expands opportunity and rewards hard work, and that candidates across the country who support that agenda are taking their message to their constituents or would-be constituents and arguing that that\xe2\x80\x99s a better way forward than the alternative.\xc2\xa0 So the President has laid out an agenda that Democrats have supported and support, and that, broadly speaking, addresses the concerns that most Americans say they put at the top of the list, which is the need to continue this economic recovery, to expand opportunity, to make sure that their hard work is rewarded, and that their kids are being educated and prepared for the jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President is focused on, and he knows and believes that Democrats across the country join him in that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Does he think that the special election is a referendum on Obamacare since both candidates have been talking a lot about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about an individual congressional election.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear demarcation that Republicans have highlighted by saying that they want to go back through repeal to a world where the insurance companies decide, Mara, that you pay twice what your twin brother would pay -- if you were to have one -- for the same insurance because you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman, to a world where anybody with a preexisting condition could be booted off their plan, or could find out in the fine print that their condition -- the very situation that requires them to need health care -- is not covered in the plan that they have.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the world that exists through repeal.</p>\n<p>So candidates out there who are supporting a law that provides affordable, quality health insurance to millions of Americans, including millions who haven\xe2\x80\x99t had it in the past, we believe they have a pretty clear case to make against the argument for repeal, which is basically an argument in favor of empowering the insurance companies at the expense of individuals, an argument ironically in favor of exploding the deficit because, as the CBO has noted, the law of the long-term deficit reduction that the Affordable Care Act provides; an argument for returning to higher rates of health care cost growth, because as you know, since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the lowest levels of health care cost inflation in half a century.\xc2\xa0 That\'s their plan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s their pitch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we think a pitch that focuses on providing benefits to the American people, a pitch that does what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done at the administration level, which is make fixes that are necessary to help smooth a transition to the Affordable Care Act and through the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that that is a far better argument to the American people than one that says let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to a time when the insurance company got to decide whether you got coverage or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get to some of my regulars here.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Ukraine aid, the House last week passed the $1 billion loan guarantee rate.\xc2\xa0 The Senate is working on a draft right now that contains the loan guarantee plus some additional monies to IMF, as I understand it.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a preferred path on this legislation, any preferred way of -- a clean bill versus a little bit more complicated bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we strongly support passing IMF quota reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about additional funding.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about reform legislation that the President strongly supports.\xc2\xa0 He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to our national security interests and to our support for Ukraine sovereignty.</p>\n<p>The IMF is the world\xe2\x80\x99s first responder in this kind of crisis, providing the expertise and financing needed to restore the Ukrainian economy to financial stability and growth.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has used its leadership position in the IMF to ensure that the IMF is forward-leaning in its response to the crisis in Ukraine, but we need to pass the IMF reform to maintain our leadership on issues like this one.\xc2\xa0 We need to bolster the IMF and its capacity to lend to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So while the United States will not increase our total financial commitment to the IMF by approving the 2010 reforms -- and these are 2010 reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to approve -- it is important to note that for every dollar the United States contributes to the IMF, other countries provide four dollars more.\xc2\xa0 So we strongly support the passage of this quota reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any sort of, kind of tentative deadline that the White House would like to have this done by?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Within the month?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific deadline.\xc2\xa0 The sooner the better.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what\xe2\x80\x99s the next step for this White House as it relates to the Civil Rights post to Justice since the recent situation in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question in light of the unfortunate choice made by senators when it came to the nomination of an enormously qualified individual, Debo Adegbile, to that position.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have information now for you.\xc2\xa0 I would note that Senator Reid took action that would allow for bringing up that nomination again.\xc2\xa0 But as far as a personnel matter related to that post, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have people on the Hill waiting for your word to push this effort for the nominee.\xc2\xa0 But do you think that it\xe2\x80\x99s dead because it\xe2\x80\x99s already -- it\xe2\x80\x99s died, and many people are saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get out of committee, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it got out of committee the first time.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for him.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that Senator Reid, as a leader, can do -- voted \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d so that he could recommit -- and I hope I get the terminology right -- and this nomination could be put forward again.</p>\n<p>More important right now for us is what we said very strongly about our profound disappointment with the actions taken by the Senate -- a decision essentially that says that lawyers have to be held accountable for the clients they represent, which would create a wholly new standard when it comes to nominations to positions like this and to the bench.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- again, April, when it comes to steps forward on this, filling this post, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new information for you.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, both United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States intend to follow suit considering they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually talked to these groups before?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the United States has not designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 On the broader issue, we\xe2\x80\x99re following recent decisions made by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain with respect to their ambassadors to Qatar.\xc2\xa0 But on that particular question, our policy has not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see it as politically motivated?\xc2\xa0 Do you see a national security reason for it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we enjoy strong relations with all of these countries, and we encourage them to resolve their differences as soon as possible for the benefit of regional security and cohesion.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I have a Ukraine aid question.\xc2\xa0 If the Russian Federation, after the referendum, acts to take responsibility for the economic wellbeing of the people in Crimea, and the United States is saying that we would recognize that along with the rest of the world, would the international aid that goes to Ukraine still benefit the people of Crimea after that point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the aid we provide to Ukraine and how it\xe2\x80\x99s used -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the intricacies of the legislation when it comes to the disbursement of aid, if it were passed -- or the loan guarantees and how that would work, but it is a provision of assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And as I said last week, Crimea is a part of the sovereign state of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 But how that aid would be utilized, I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President have an official or personal reaction to the death of the Vice President of Afghanistan over the weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 We obviously -- our thoughts and prayers are with his family, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific, official reaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And earlier, when you were talking about the Ukraine -- the Crimea referendum, you said that it will not be viewed as legitimate.\xc2\xa0 Is there an official vehicle for the United States to express that?\xc2\xa0 Is there a United Nations resolution?\xc2\xa0 Is there something that can be done through NATO?\xc2\xa0 Is there any way that that can be expressed?\xc2\xa0 Or is this just going to be something that is said from here and from the State Department?</p>\n<p>Mr. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when we express our views on something, we do it from here, we do it through top officials like the President, the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not alone in having that view.\xc2\xa0 It is, through our understanding, a violation of the Ukrainian constitution.\xc2\xa0 So, again, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be alone. So the actions we\xe2\x80\x99re taking -- and I think this goes to what I was talking about earlier -- are not focused on the referendum, per se; we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on resolving this in a way that is diplomatic and peaceful so that the concerns that Russia has said motivated it to take the actions it\xe2\x80\x99s taken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you expect so much as a non-binding U.N. resolution?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying one way or the other what action might be taken along those lines.\xc2\xa0 I think the world will have spoken pretty clearly and loudly, and already has, when it comes to views about the violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 And as a piece of this, I think no one will doubt what our view is or what the view of other countries is.</p>\n<p>Chris, and then Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The LGBT Equality Caucus and Senator Jeff Merkley are circulating a letter on Capitol Hill calling on President Obama to sign an executive order protecting LGBT workers from discrimination.\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to see supporters of that action, like the lawmakers behind this letter, to continue encouraging him to sign it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our view is that Congress ought to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on possible executive orders.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is on a legislative remedy that would be more comprehensive and that has already seen progress in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a view to express on that particular issue.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Follow-ups on Iran and on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 The interdiction of that ship carrying arms to Gaza, has that re-charted the negotiations with Iran in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked this I think last week, and we were very clear about our views on the ship that was interdicted and the fact that we condemn in the strongest terms Iran\xe2\x80\x99s effort to supply terrorist organizations operating in the region with weaponry.\xc2\xa0 The shipment of advanced weapons was believed to be bound for militant groups in Gaza, and posed a direct threat to the security of Israel.\xc2\xa0 The Israeli government unloaded the seized vessel in Eilat this weekend, and we understand the vessel contained rockets, mortars, and nearly 400,000 AK-47 shells.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We, the United States, strongly condemn this violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929.\xc2\xa0 It is important to make clear that even as we continue efforts to resolve our concerns over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program through diplomacy, we will continue, in coordination with our partners and allies, to push back against Iranian support for terrorism, threats against our friends and partners in violations of human rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So as we pursue an important goal, which is a resolution of the challenge posed by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, we are not holding back at all in the steps we take and the views we hold about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s continued support for terrorist organizations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And on Cuba, I asked you a few weeks ago about the Cuban prisoners.\xc2\xa0 Since then, one prisoner has been released from an American jail, one Cuban prisoner.\xc2\xa0 Have you had any contact with the Cubans about Alan Gross?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alan Gross has been unjustly imprisoned by Cuban authorities for more than four years.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work to secure his release.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gross is a 64-year-old husband, father and dedicated professional with a long history of providing aid to undeserved -- underserved, rather, communities in more than 50 countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We reiterate our call for the Cuban government to release Alan Gross.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gross\xe2\x80\x99s detention remains an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one more question from Colorado?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Colorado, what do you got?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to follow up on that one about Obama -- well, the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned that the Republicans are giving this pitch to, I guess, repeal the bill.\xc2\xa0 And so my question --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Surely your reporting reflects that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not misstating --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, it was the reasons you gave that I wanted to ask you about.\xc2\xa0 And the last time I was here, I asked you a question and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer it, so I hope I\xe2\x80\x99ll have better luck this time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for his -- have you got the camera on him?\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I saw you using notes, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use mine as well.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Go for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the law was first debated and passed -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Affordable Care Act -- the polls showed a majority of the people were not in favor of that, and yet it was pushed through.\xc2\xa0 And so in terms of this pitch, the President continued to pitch to get it passed using statements like \xe2\x80\x9cyou can keep your plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, I know that\xe2\x80\x99s not true because my wife lost her insurance because of the Affordable Care Act -- that you can --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your question, sir?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We don\'t get here very often from out in middle country, so when you get your chance, you got to ask.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So anyway, the President\xe2\x80\x99s pitch was that you can keep your plan, that your costs will go down, and I know that not to be true.\xc2\xa0 So my question is:\xc2\xa0 Will the President accede to the greater majority of Americans now who want it repealed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually that\'s not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why won\xe2\x80\x99t he listen to the American people?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You obviously haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the data because the majority of Americans do not in any poll want it repealed.\xc2\xa0 The majority supports fixing it and improving it, not repealing it.\xc2\xa0 I would ask you to check your data.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the President made that pitch.\xc2\xa0 Republicans in Congress fought it tooth and nail.\xc2\xa0 It went to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court upheld it.\xc2\xa0 It was the principal argument in a presidential election.\xc2\xa0 The President won reelection.</p>\n<p>And again, Republicans are free to make the repeal argument. My point was simply that when you go to individuals and you ask them, do you want quality, affordable health insurance, or do you want the insurance company to tell you that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get coverage for that condition you have because the fine print says you can\'t.\xc2\xa0 In fact, your sister, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to charge her double even though you have identical medical histories because she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, my wife is getting charged double now because she lost her insurance.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t know the circumstances with your wife.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is that the Affordable Care Act provides quality, affordable health insurance to millions of people.\xc2\xa0 They are -- million are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 More people have lost their insurance because of the act right now than have been -- didn\'t have insurance and have signed up.\xc2\xa0 That is a fact.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to your facts, sir. What I can tell you is that you and others who want to campaign on repeal are welcome to.</p>\n<p>What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that repeal for millions of Americans is not a good option and for all the reasons that I enumerated.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question from Bethesda?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:17 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
