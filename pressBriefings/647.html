EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everyone ready?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 As you know, today the President will address the Disabled American Veterans National Conference in Orlando.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will introduce him.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Shinseki is speaking this morning.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss the five priorities the administration is focused on to ensure that we will fulfill our promise to all who have served -- first, ensuring that the resources our veterans deserve are available; second, delivering the health care they count on; third, ending the claims backlog; fourth, protecting veterans\xe2\x80\x99 rights and dignity; and five, ensuring that all veterans, when they transition from service to civilian life, have a chance at the American Dream.</p>\n<p>Specifically, he will note progress made on the VA\xe2\x80\x99s claims backlog, a personal priority of the President, and that progress represents a nearly 20 percent reduction in the past five months. He will also announce a new national research plan to address Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD and veterans suicide.</p>\n<p>With that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be more details and I know we gave you a fact sheet -- I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk more about the PTSD thing, what exactly that is?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to -- I think we gave you information about it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to refer you to the VA.\xc2\xa0 Maybe we can get you more information on the ground.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not steeped in the details.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the 20 percent reduction that you said the President is going to talk about in the backlog claims, is there a hard number, like from what to what?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On March 25th there were 611,000; on August 9th, it was down to 496,000.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Four-nine-six?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Four-nine-six.\xc2\xa0 And I can just say, I know, because I see it all the time, the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus on this is intense, as is the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 Denis McDonough has taken a personal interest in making sure that this issue is getting high-level and constant attention, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Secretary Shinseki is giving it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, after Florida the President and his wife are heading to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard for the next week\xe2\x80\x99s worth of a vacation.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk us through what you expect on his schedule tonight or the rest of the week?\xc2\xa0 Who will he see at the Vineyard?\xc2\xa0 We saw Susan Rice and Rob Nabors aboard.\xc2\xa0 Who else is he traveling with?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Susan Rice is the national security representative for the trip.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s always someone from the NSS on the trip, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be here and briefing the President as necessary, as is the case whenever he takes a trip like this.\xc2\xa0 Rob Nabors is the senior representative from the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s always one of those. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m your press rep.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99ll be some staff shuffling through the week as some of us depart and others come in.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the complement at senior staff level.</p>\n<p>In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, I know he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward very much to some downtime with his family, with the First Lady, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll see some friends, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a social schedule to offer you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you talk to us about how he balances the need for daily briefings with his right to chill out for a couple days at the end of the summer?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to get daily briefings?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a video link to the White House?\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting any major news this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not expecting to make any major news this week.\xc2\xa0 I just want to repeat that my comment about a Fed chairman announcement was a joke the other day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even hear that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry.\xc2\xa0 I think I just gave Mason some heartburn.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But, of course, news happens and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to predict.</p>\n<p>The President receives briefings daily on both national security and domestic matters, and that will be the case.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule for that and I can\xe2\x80\x99t brief you on technological capabilities, but as is the case on this plane and as is the case everywhere Presidents go -- this President and any President goes, he will be able to communicate as necessary with all the capacity that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you know what the impact is of sequestration on the spending for disabled veterans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The VA might have that information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a vacation reading list for us?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President reading any books on his vacation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I expect he will and I will see what I can find out.\xc2\xa0 Most of the many hours I spent with him in the last couple of weeks, when he\xe2\x80\x99s been reading, he\xe2\x80\x99s been reading briefing materials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where are the girls?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have to ask the East Wing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ll be joining him at --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not on the plane, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Bo?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Bo yet, but if he is, I look forward to saying hello.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Send him back.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a great dog.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any lawmakers or guests for the leg to Florida who are also aboard the plane?\xc2\xa0 Anyone --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Shinseki on Air Force One?\xc2\xa0 No?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s already there.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is already there.\xc2\xa0 He is speaking this morning.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check on the manifest.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe we have any lawmakers or other guests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with regard to the President, what he is going to read and everything, do you have any reaction to the American Booksellers Association calling the President highlighting Amazon "misguided?"\xc2\xa0 Independent booksellers are a little upset.\xc2\xa0 There was an open letter to the President.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got that question at the time, and I can just tell you the President visited the fulfillment center of Amazon in Tennessee because it represents a businesses and an enterprise that is creating jobs in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And he used that location to give one of his jobs-focused speeches on his economic agenda.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is also a huge supporter of independent booksellers and makes a point of buying books at independent booksellers whenever he is able, given the constraints of being able to walk around as President.\xc2\xa0 But I know he has on his vacations in the past purchased books at independent booksellers. I wouldn\'t be surprised if in search of fulfilling the book reading list that Carol mentioned, he might visit one on this trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is he only taking a week\'s vacation in a non-election year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he is obviously looking forward to the time that he is able to take, but also will return to continue to work on the agenda that he has laid out to focus our attention on the middle class, what we can do to keep the economy growing, help it grow faster, and invest in those areas of the economy that will create solid, good-paying jobs for the middle class and give them greater security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to take any down time or anything else after this trip even back at the White House?\xc2\xa0 I feel like one year he did Martha\'s Vineyard, then he came back and then that next week wasn\'t a full working week.\xc2\xa0 I guess, Labor Day.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The week he is back will be a full working week.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any schedule beyond that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday in the President\'s press conference, he mentioned that he had recently spoken with Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a timing on when that was?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was shortly before they went on recess.\xc2\xa0 I think it was within the last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the topic and who called who?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think I\'ve tried to convey from the podium, the President speaks with members and leaders of Congress with some regularity.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t read out every one of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 My sense is they spoke about a variety of the issues that are coming up for action by Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that would include immigration reform, as well as some of the economic initiatives the President would like Congress to take up, those that require legislative action, and obviously, the budget issues that we have to deal with in the fall.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have a specific readout.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just making some assumptions here.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, the President put forward a proposition, a bargain for the middle class in which he asks Republicans and Democrats as well to consider coupling business tax reform with significant investments in areas that help create middle-class jobs.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that was probably one subject of the conversation.</p>\n<p>But I can see if there\'s more of a read out.\xc2\xa0 But I think the point was -- well, the President answered the question because it was asked, had he spoken with the Speaker recently, and the answer was yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on whether there have been any foreign leader calls, including with President Putin, and whether there are any calls or briefings that you can elaborate on related to the AQ-AQAP revelations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been no foreign calls that I have to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 The President has not spoken to President Putin since his press conference.\xc2\xa0 But as you I\'m sure know, the Russian foreign and defense ministers met with Secretaries Hagel and Kerry yesterday and that was a constructive meeting in which the two Secretaries and their counterparts discussed ways to continue to engage in areas of importance, both on security matters and economic matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- condone his description of President Putin as a schoolboy in the back of the room?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department or Defense Department for more details on that meeting, but the President\'s press conference was public.\xc2\xa0 The point the President was making -- I think this is important to emphasize -- was that, understandably, in part because visuals are what they are, the press tends to focus on body language in photographs, and sometimes that body language doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect completely the nature of the conversations and meetings that the President has had with his Russian counterpart.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To go back to the vacation for a second, can you give us any sort of sense of what kinds of official business the President will work on during the vacation besides getting these daily briefings from Susan Rice or Nabors or whoever else will come in the briefing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President is working on a full agenda, so in addition to the briefings that he\'ll get, he\'ll, I\'m sure, do some thinking about and reading about how to move forward on the better bargain for the middle class, which he\'s been talking about a lot recently and you can expect he\'ll be talking about a great deal in the days and weeks following this vacation.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll also continue to, I\'m sure, consider some of the issues that he talked about yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s nothing specific beyond the broader agenda that he\'ll be working on.\xc2\xa0 He does, obviously, look forward to some down time with his family.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a scheduling update.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Boehner, should we read this as a meeting that the two of them are going to be negotiating on these budget issues going forward, or is this just a customary conversation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the latter, though I don\'t have any updates for you on where we need to -- what meetings might take place.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'ve heard me sort of have this discussion before, Carol, even before you were away, but the President has put forward, when it comes to a comprehensive budget proposal, a very detailed plan that represents by any measure compromise and an attempt to meet Republicans halfway.\xc2\xa0 And he has engaged with Republican lawmakers for much of this year, as has his senior staff, in conversations about how we can find that common ground, and they\'ve been useful conversations.\xc2\xa0 But what we haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet seen from Republicans is a similar proposal representing compromise from them.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to that happening and hope it does.\xc2\xa0 But as of this time we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 10:53 A.M. EDT \xc2\xa0</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
