BIDEN:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so this has been an absolutely incredible trip.\xc2\xa0 General Keen from the U.S. Army took us around with the U.S. military today.\xc2\xa0 We saw areas of devastation.\xc2\xa0 We saw schools.\xc2\xa0 We saw camps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I think the one thing that we take away from it is really the strength and the resilience of the human spirit, and that\'s what we saw today and that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll take home to Washington with us.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>MRS. OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, and I think it was important for Jill and I to come now because we\xe2\x80\x99re at the point where the relief efforts are underway but the attention of the world starts to wane a bit.\xc2\xa0 And as we enter the rainy season and the hurricane season, you know, the issues are just going to become more compounded.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was important for us to come and shed a light.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it was also important to speak to the President and First Lady, who is just -- she is just a powerhouse.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s been working on education.\xc2\xa0 The school that we visited, this sort of bus camp, was one of two sites that are feeding and caring for nearly a thousand children a day that are coming through those -- that particular site.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re reading, they\xe2\x80\x99re dancing, they\xe2\x80\x99re painting.\xc2\xa0 I painted a purple fish, by the way -- (laughter) -- and Jill did a house --</p>\n<p>DR. BIDEN:\xc2\xa0 A house.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MRS. OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 With trees and everything.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very good.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s providing some level of stability and normalcy for kids who don\'t really have a place to go yet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what is clear is that there is still so much to do.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when we flew over -- we did an aerial tour because it was probably the quickest and safest way -- but what you see -- you know, imagine a country where every church and every school has been destroyed.\xc2\xa0 And at least that\'s what the -- every church and every school has been destroyed and has to be rebuilt from the bottom up.</p>\n<p>Now, that\'s an incredibly daunting challenge, but as the President sees it, it\xe2\x80\x99s also an incredible responsibility.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take all of us.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we talked about when we met with the U.N. staff, is that this has not been a U.S. effort.\xc2\xa0 This has been a global effort.\xc2\xa0 America has been a leader, but it has not been the only leader, by any close margin.\xc2\xa0 And in order for Haiti to get back to where it needs to be, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take the world continuing to invest, to partner, to show that sense of compassion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Stepping up and seeing the world work on behalf of Haiti has been the absolute right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s just been a privilege for Jill and I to be able to come to see for ourselves, to lend support, to boost morale wherever.\xc2\xa0 You know, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us and America to know that we still have U.S. Embassy officials working here, working here tirelessly.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve left their families.\xc2\xa0 Some have sent them back home.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re living in tents.\xc2\xa0 The same for U.N. officials.</p>\n<p>And the world needs to understand that there is still a small cadre of people working day in and day out to get this country back on its feet.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re just happy to be able to shed a little light on this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DR. BIDEN:\xc2\xa0 God bless them.</p>\n<p>MRS. OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>DR. BIDEN:\xc2\xa0 And God bless the Haitians.</p>\n<p>MRS. OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 So thank you all.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for following us around and covering this.\xc2\xa0 This has been an emotional but important day for Jill and I.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So thank you.</p>\n<p>DR. BIDEN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on what you saw today, do you think that the aid money that\'s been contributed by Americans is actually reaching the Haitian people?</p>\n<p>MRS. OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And, you know, by all accounts, the Haitian people are very happy with the relief efforts.\xc2\xa0 Still, accountability is key.\xc2\xa0 And, you know, I know that the governments are going to continue to work together.\xc2\xa0 But I think that my sense is the Haitian people feel a deep appreciation for what the world has done, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:51 P.M.
