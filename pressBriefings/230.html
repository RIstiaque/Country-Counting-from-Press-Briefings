EAT</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Whatever you want to talk about. \xc2\xa0You guys go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0South Sudan may be helpful, to get a sense of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0So following the bilateral program tomorrow, the President will meet for about an hour and a half with a handful of regional leaders to talk about South Sudan, primarily, but also regional counterterrorism issues. \xc2\xa0We expect the President of Uganda, the President of Kenya, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, the Chairwoman of the African Union, the Foreign Minister of Sudan -- not South Sudan, Sudan. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point is this comes at a time when, after a year and a half of intense effort that we have very, very actively supported, the IGAD negotiating process is on the verge of laying down what amounts to a sort of final offer to the South Sudanese warring parties. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for an answer by the 17th of August --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Right, that\xe2\x80\x99s when it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be completely entered into. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a draft to the parties. \xc2\xa0The parties have some time now to consult and then they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to come back for a ministerial-level meeting and then a summit among the IGAD parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0On the fifth?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0No, the summit is closer to the 17th. \xc2\xa0I can get the calendar.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I missed it. \xc2\xa0IGAD is?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which is the East African regional -- a East African regional organization that consists of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Sudan -- South Sudan in the IGAD?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Who else? \xc2\xa0Uganda -- not Tanzania, Tanzania is not in the IGAD -- that have been doing the mediation on this. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s really been Ethiopia in the mediation with the Kenyans and others actively involved -- and the AU increasingly involved -- the African Union.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo they\xe2\x80\x99re laying down essentially a final offer and we have been very actively through the course of this effort supporting the African Union and the IGAD. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s Special Envoy, Don Booth, is out there. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been out there constantly over the last year and a half. \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry has been actively involved in this. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve been actively involved in this. \xc2\xa0Gayle Smith has also traveled on behalf of the White House on occasion to support this effort. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s been despite the best efforts of the East Africans and the IGAD and the Ethiopians in particular, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 recalcitrance has been unrelenting. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ve also received -- there\xe2\x80\x99s also been very significant divisions within IGAD because Sudan, on the one hand, has tacitly supported the rebels and Uganda, on the other hand, has overtly supported the government in Juba. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those two factors -- the recalcitrance of the parties and the venality of the parties, combined with the divisions within IGAD have made this very difficult to achieve a successful outcome. \xc2\xa0And meanwhile, the humanitarian situation is getting worse; the two sides are fracturing internally.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this coincides, obviously, with the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xc2\xa0This is obviously an issue on which we\xe2\x80\x99ve long had a significant interest. \xc2\xa0So the President thought it was timely and worthwhile to bring the key players in the region together to reinforce our common interest in getting the two sides to agree to this final best offer, but also to discuss in very concrete terms if that does not succeed, what are we doing next, what\xe2\x80\x99s the follow-on play, what should be the revised approach -- which is not going to be more of the same. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- in our view, it needs to entail thinking about a transition of a different character and the application of significant pressure on both sides, including additional sanctions. \xc2\xa0And so this is an opportunity to reinforce the effort that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table and to strategize and concert efforts on next steps in the event that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When you said \xe2\x80\x9ctransition,\xe2\x80\x9d you mean a transition of government or a --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Transitional government. \xc2\xa0And the IGAD proposal envisions a transition, but it would envision a power-sharing between the two sides. \xc2\xa0Another way to approach it is a transitional period that might have a different composition. \xc2\xa0But for a period of time -- I think the IGAD is 30 months -- it could be plus or minus, in which basically this state that was virtually stillborn is able to put in place sufficient peace and stability and institutions to run a new election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a specific outcome that the President is expecting out of this?<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0As I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do two things. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reinforce the proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table and put maximum pressure on the parties to accept it, and to do some strategizing with the key players in the region -- trying to arrive at a common perspective on what we might do in the event that that fails. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily something that we will find productive to be public about in advance of the two sides having the opportunity to say yes or no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is this the first time the Sudanese Foreign Minister or somebody of that level in the Sudanese government has met with the President of the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99re checking that. \xc2\xa0The only -- we were checking multilateral meetings in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Wait, I can give you off the top of my head -- Taha was the Vice President, was at the U.N. in 2010.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Yes, 2010 --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did they talk, or they were part of a meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0They certainly shook hands and had informal communication. \xc2\xa0But this, again, is not a bilateral meeting; it\xe2\x80\x99s a multilateral.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Vice President then?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll check it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Without describing what the plan B is, does the U.S. have a preferred plan B that you will sort of unveil?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0We obviously have some thoughts on a plan B, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview that publicly before we have an opportunity to talk to the regional leaders. \xc2\xa0I mean, the point is to be on one page. \xc2\xa0And even after we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the conversation with the regional leaders, I think it would be counterproductive in all likelihood to get into detail.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you expect there will be any kind of a readout tomorrow after the meeting for us?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I think there will probably be just a written readout. \xc2\xa0And obviously the President, in his speech to the African Union, will have an opportunity to speak in his own words on South Sudan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a time frame for when you get to the point of having to decide plan A or plan B?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get to the 17th and see what happens and where we are. \xc2\xa0But this is an important opportunity to lay a predicate for what we hope will be more united action among the countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tIs there anything you want to add on just the front end on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Only that in addition to South Sudan, as my colleague mentioned, it\xe2\x80\x99s also going to be a chance to talk about other regional security issues, which could include counterterrorism issues, countering violence extremism. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re sure that Somalia and other salient issues will come up, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not exclusively on South Sudan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you say how long the planning for this meeting has been taking place? \xc2\xa0When did the idea for it originate? \xc2\xa0And what kind of preparations have been going on at the staff level ahead of time?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about this for some while. \xc2\xa0Obviously, until we got closer to the time of the trip, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be certain whether this was a ripe moment. \xc2\xa0We think it is. \xc2\xa0Again, not ripe for necessarily a huge breakthrough -- I think that would be overly optimistic, given how difficult the parties have been -- but ripe for the most involved players who have varying degrees of influence on the parties to agree on a way forward. \xc2\xa0In the first instance, I think it will be -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be agreed on the importance of supporting IGAD, but I think then talking about, if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, what then, is timely.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of work at the staff level. \xc2\xa0Our special envoy has been in the region working on this. \xc2\xa0I have made phone calls to some of the regional leaders. \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry has made phone calls to some of the regional leaders in recent days, talking about our thinking and eliciting theirs. \xc2\xa0And obviously the President, in his bilateral with Kenyatta, and his bilateral tomorrow with Prime Minister Hailemariam, will also have an opportunity before the summit meeting to have this kind of discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know if there are any South Sudanese representatives who are going to be in Addis during the two days?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0There probably will be some.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any plans for the President or you or other senior officials to talk to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was the President of South Sudan in Nairobi while we were here?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I heard he was here. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not true?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0No, not to my knowledge. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear about Salva being in Nairobi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to include them in a meeting like this?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0No, I think at this point our view is that both parties are part of the problem and this is not an opportunity for them to have a bunch of air time. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve had many, many opportunities with the regional leaders. \xc2\xa0I think the point is to underscore that there\xe2\x80\x99s unity around the IGAD effort and that there will be unity in the aftermath, and that if these guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t with the program, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to face sustained and concerted pressure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give a sense of, given that Sudan and Uganda, you\xe2\x80\x99ve identified them as key players fueling the conflict, what you think can happen to enlist their support in coming to a common compromise among the regional players? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the opportunity there?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, obviously, first of all, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a differentiation here. \xc2\xa0Sudan is arming and supporting rebels. \xc2\xa0Uganda, as a sovereign, has accepted the invitation of a sovereign to defend -- help them defend Juba and the city of Bor and, importantly, the airport, which, frankly, for the international community, has been a blessing because in the absence of that it would have been very difficult for us not to have pulled out our embassy personnel 18 months ago and to have kept them there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think, politically, we would like to see Uganda use its influence to encourage Salva Kiir to accept a rational deal\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t-- that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for from them. \xc2\xa0And so we do see an opportunity, although by no means -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to say a likelihood. \xc2\xa0I mean, this is an effort we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking because we believe it has the potential to be helpful and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, and it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the sustained effort we\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting into the challenge of South Sudan for many years, and especially in the wake of the conflict breaking out. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that anybody should have high expectations that this is going to yield a breakthrough. \xc2\xa0The parties have shown themselves to be utterly indifferent to their country and their people, and that is a hard thing to rectify. \xc2\xa0So Sudan obviously can do its part by being part of a regional solution, backing it with sincerity and halting the flow of weapons and funding and support to Riek Machar. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Besides South Sudan, are there some initiatives -- some financial commitments or initiatives on al-Shabaab that will be announced tomorrow? \xc2\xa0Is there anything else about tomorrow -- just pitching us forward -- that you can help preview?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, I think you heard the President yesterday talk about our security cooperation with Kenya against al-Shabaab and the additional resources we\xe2\x80\x99re putting into that. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re a huge supporter of AMISOM, which includes not just Uganda and Kenya and Ethiopia very substantially. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear a lot in the way of new initiatives. \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear that we continue to be AMISOM\xe2\x80\x99s, I daresay, most active and important external partner, both from a funding point of view and a support point of view.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any new drone-related policy or investments to announce tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I was just going to add that tomorrow we will put out some more background information on some of the ongoing assistance and additional resources that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be providing to regional partners in East Africa on security issues in particular, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have that in a factsheet that will come around. \xc2\xa0And then, if I may just add to the previous point, fundamentally, it\xe2\x80\x99s in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the region to end the humanitarian disaster and the regional economic drain that South Sudan has become. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to align interests in that regard. \xc2\xa0I would just put that in a finer point -- 40 percent of the population is on humanitarian assistance right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0We pay for about 40 percent of the assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s right. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re primarily funding that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just wanted to clarify, when you said a couple of times you\xe2\x80\x99re not expecting a breakthrough, and the first time it was clear -- you mean tomorrow, but do you also mean by the 17th, or you just meant --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Both.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Some people have called for an arms embargo, but you\xe2\x80\x99re opposed -- is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not opposed. \xc2\xa0We have supported a U.N. Security Council resolution that explicitly threatened an arms embargo and we think it\xe2\x80\x99s, in the failure of this last effort, one of the options that\xe2\x80\x99s right on the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Arms embargo and new sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0That is a sanction, as you know, but additional sanctions. \xc2\xa0All those are things that we\xe2\x80\x99re actively considering. \xc2\xa0But the thing is we have to find tools that affect the two parties equally, and the arms embargo is more one-sided than two-sided.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are there other types of sanctions that you can at least sort of detail without -- I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to detail.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I think that you can envision sanctions on individuals that would go after assets, travel. \xc2\xa0I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- sanctions, or U.S. sanctions, or both?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Either/or. \xc2\xa0They could be national sanctions; they could be national sanctions taken in concert with a number of other countries, including countries in the region or the European Union; and/or they could be United Nations sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This has been a priority for you, particularly, and other people in the administration -- the whole birth of -- as you say, South Sudan happened on your watch, it\xe2\x80\x99s something you wanted to be successful. \xc2\xa0How does it feel and how does the President feel about having to try to put it all back together again when it just sort of never --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, this is not just an Obama administration initiative. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been going back to the Bush administration, and even the Clinton administration, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very invested in South Sudan. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve long been the biggest provider of humanitarian assistance. \xc2\xa0Twenty years ago we were working with IGAD on a plan to try to get South Sudan to become independent, between Sudan and South Sudan. \xc2\xa0The Bush administration, under Special Envoy John Danforth, worked very hard on this and made significant progress. We came in and we were able, with others in the international community -- I was up in New York at the time -- helped to shepherd through a peaceful referendum that resulted in, ultimately, the independence of South Sudan. \xc2\xa0That was the right thing after decades of war for a people that desperately -- 98 percent of whom voted for independence.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a tragedy is that subsequently, the internal rivalries and divisions among the South Sudanese political elite and members of the government -- remember, all these people were serving together in the same government -- let their own personal interests, quests for power and money override their interest in the state. \xc2\xa0And when violence broke out. \xc2\xa0It quickly became widespread and ethnic in nature. \xc2\xa0It opened up fissures in the society that had been there for a long time. \xc2\xa0It garnered the interest and the involvement of the states in the region until -- this is a very, very unfortunate development and I think the people of South Sudan are those that, after all they\xe2\x80\x99ve been through, least need and deserve the suffering that they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with now.</p>\n<p>\n\tI taped a video for the fourth anniversary of South Sudanese --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last month?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0No, July 9th, this month -- for their independence. \xc2\xa0And so if you want to see what I think, I said it -- I mean, those were my words. \xc2\xa0And I think that from the point of view of the United States, we are very committed to the people of South Sudan and we will continue to do our best to help them achieve the future that they deserve. \xc2\xa0But as the President has said repeatedly throughout this trip and going back to his first trip to Africa, Africa is for the Africans to sort out. \xc2\xa0External actors, even ones as interested as the United States, can\xe2\x80\x99t do it for them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is a classic case of venal leaders squandering a huge opportunity that they themselves earned, that we all in the international community supported them to obtain. \xc2\xa0So we can\xe2\x80\x99t undo this for them. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to fix this. \xc2\xa0But you see the amount of international effort and attention. \xc2\xa0The regional leaders have devoted -- particularly Ethiopia -- tons of man hours to try to unscramble this thing, and so have all the leaders that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with, and so is the United States and so is the Troika, which includes Britain and Norway and the U.N. itself. \xc2\xa0But at the end of the day, nobody can make them make peace.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I feel like every administration ends up having this kind of frustration. \xc2\xa0I mean, you had Rwanda, arguably, under Clinton. \xc2\xa0You had Darfur under Bush. \xc2\xa0You had --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is comparable. \xc2\xa0For whatever you want to say, this is not, thankfully, yet a genocide. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s not oversimplify.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks for doing this.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t5:05 P.M.
