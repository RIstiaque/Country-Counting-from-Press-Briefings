EST</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing that I don\'t think was asked in some of the briefings this morning:\xc2\xa0 If everything goes as you think it\'s going to go with the housing plan, how soon might the market turn around?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The housing market or the stock market?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me start with the housing market, I\'m going to come back on the stock market.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, well, let me address both.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously as we\'ve said it on a number of occasions, none of these individual legs of the stool that the President has talked about are designed in any way for a one-day market reaction.\xc2\xa0 And I think the confluence of economic news that we get every day shows the depth of the challenges that we face.\xc2\xa0 I mean, opening up the newspaper today or reading statistics about housing starts or banks in Europe or Eastern Europe -- you know, I think all of it simply underscores the breadth of the challenges that we face to not only our economy, but getting the global economy back on track.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I hesitate to predict when the statistics that come out might be positive versus what we\'re seeing now.\xc2\xa0 But I think as the President has said, and certainly underscored yesterday, the economy is probably going to get worse before it gets better.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time I think yesterday was a big step forward in passing -- in signing into the law the recovery and reinvestment plan; and then today an aggressive plan to deal with not just those that are in foreclosure, but to take and help the millions of people that through no fault of their own now find themselves owing more on a house than it\'s worth, and the enormous challenges that that presents to a family trying to refinance or lower their payments in order to get by each month.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not able to say whether the steps you announced today will stabilize the market within the next few months or even within the current year?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- do I think today\'s steps will have a positive impact?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely and wholeheartedly.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to predict when housing starts -- when those statistics might change.\xc2\xa0 But do I think that the aggressive plan that the President and his team have laid out to prevent and forestall home foreclosures and the decline in housing prices -- I don\'t think there\'s any doubt of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Look, just the simple fact alone that, as was said in these briefings, if your house is near a home that\'s foreclosed the value of your house decreases, research shows, by about 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a big deal for people with a mortgage.\xc2\xa0 So I think an aggressive plan that will finally stem the tide, the rising tide of home foreclosures, will have a big impact.\xc2\xa0 I think it is, as the President has said, one aspect of the many problems that we\'re dealing with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me come back to the stock market, then.\xc2\xa0 There was a big sell-off yesterday after the signing of the stimulus plan.\xc2\xa0 There was a big sell-off after Secretary Geithner -- so you\'re not talking one day, you\'re talking two days that were --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How many people think that -- how many of you have stock investments?\xc2\xa0 Probably most of you, right?\xc2\xa0 The day TARP passed, right, the market went up a thousand points.\xc2\xa0 Now, I don\'t know about you, but how many people that\'s gone well so far?\xc2\xa0 Right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think judging one day\'s events are somewhat, if not rather, meaningless.\xc2\xa0 Let me finish.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I also believe that -- I mean, I think most economists would also tell you that an accumulation of news both over the weekend and on Monday impact the market on Tuesday, regardless of what individual policy moves might draw attention that day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think for any number of reasons it makes very little sense to judge any particular initiative\'s introduction or any particular initiative\'s news based on what the market may do on a particular eight or ten-hour period of any given day.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, there\'s any number of historical examples that you can go back and find that show positive reaction for the market for ultimate economic ideas that didn\'t do well, and you can find negative reaction on the day in which the market may or may not have been interpreting something that did do well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And if I could predict the stock market I\'d probably have one of these jets all to myself.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the next step?\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got a banking proposal, you\'ve got the stimulus, you\'ve got housing.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the next leg of the multi-legged stool?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think two things that will be upcoming, the first of which will be the budget over the course of the next week or so.\xc2\xa0 And I think also you\'ll see a renewed effort, particularly as we lead into the G20 meetings in April and beyond, a real effort to redo the rules of the road in a financial reregulation and regulatory reform to ensure that many of the things that caused the problems that we\'re dealing with are dealt with.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are the major things next.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I also -- there\'s implementing the recovery and reinvestment plan I think also will be very important.\xc2\xa0 The President is interested in ensuring that that\'s done correctly and quickly.\xc2\xa0 As I\'ve said repeatedly, for better or for worse, there\'s not one thing alone that we have to focus on -- there are any number.\xc2\xa0 So I think even as you sign a recovery plan you\'ve still got to worry and think about a lot of things as it relates to that leg of the stool, even as you also focus on other legs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the budget coming in connection with the speech to Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be submitted that day to Congress?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe, if I\'m not mistaken, the budget will come to Congress on the 26th -- that\'s a Thursday.\xc2\xa0 So a day or so, a day and a half after</div> <div class="legacy-para">But as I said yesterday, I think the speech will focus on any number of those legs.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will continue to talk about recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the financial regulations, are you going to be rolling those out before June 20?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that the White House, in conjunction with Congress, will be working on that before April -- there\'s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is eager to have leaders down to the White House to begin discussing what that would look like.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, roughly, what is that supposed to involve the financial reregulation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into a lot of the detail on it, I think obviously the President spoke a number of times during the campaign, even when -- I remember, I think it was early September of 2007, warning against some of the things that were happening in the financial markets that would cause problems.\xc2\xa0 So without getting into specifics, I think I\'d refer you to many of those speeches, particularly as I said the one on Wall Street and NASDAQ that enumerate some of the things that have to be done, and later speech in New York, I think in March of \'08.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you can turn back toward the camera to answer this if you would like to.\xc2\xa0 Is the cartoon inappropriate in the New York newspaper that seems to refer to the President when it shows a chimpanzee on the ground?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll do this for the benefit of the camera.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the cartoon, but I don\'t think it\'s altogether newsworthy that I don\'t spend a lot of time reading the New York Post.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a yes or a no, sorry?\xc2\xa0 Is that a yes or a no?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the cartoon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the housing plan was much more detailed than we saw in the TARP rollout plan that Geithner revealed.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason for that?\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason that the TARP plan was so much more -- I mean, the housing plan was so much more detailed?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\'ve talked about before, the -- well, as we\'ve talked about before, the framework that Secretary Geithner laid out and the work that continues on that plan we believe laid out a strong path toward ensuring stability in our financial system.\xc2\xa0 That work continues partly because there\'s any number of parts in that plan that require continued consultation.\xc2\xa0 And I think we all understand that the enormity of the problem and the complexity is vast.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of today\'s plan, I think -- I think largely based on the fact that it\'s a -- it\'s not quite to the scale that financial stability is enables you to have done some of those consultations beforehand.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there any sort of logic or rationale for the sequencing of the rollout, for example, starting with the stimulus plan, then doing the housing plan, then the financial rescue plan, which might be the hardest for Americans to swallow?\xc2\xa0 Is the President giving Americans something that they most want first, holding the plan that\'s least palatable for last?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because I think if you go back to -- you know, we were working on releasing the additional $350 billion for financial stability before we were inaugurated.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believed that, based on strong public policy reasons, that what was most important was a recovery plan that would get money into the system quickly.\xc2\xa0 The longer we delayed getting that money into the system, the longer we put off the beginning of the recovery and the changing in the trajectory of the economic downturn and how it related particularly to jobs and unemployment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But again, as I\'ve said and I think the President has said, most of this work is ongoing on many parallel tracks, and all of it will -- all of it will require attention, a constant amount of attention in order to get right, based on the size and the complexity of the issue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So there\'s not a political sequencing to this as much as there is a policy sequencing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last follow-up.\xc2\xa0 On the auto bailout, some critics have said this is a bottomless pit; there may be no end to the amount of aid that Detroit asks for.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s view of that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think as the President and many of his advisors have talked about, including myself, that we need a vibrant auto industry as part of a -- part of our manufacturing base.\xc2\xa0 We need to ensure that the cars of tomorrow are built by Americans for Americans; but at the same time, that this is going to cause some restructuring in Detroit.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And the President understands that we have to get a sustained path to that restructuring to ensure that there isn\'t a constant necessity for continued government intervention and government money from the taxpayers.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think we\'ve -- and the President, I think, has been -- has pointed this out to -- in order to ensure a path for Detroit that works not just for taxpayers but for auto workers, for the companies, and for consumers, for quite some time he\'s pointed out that we have to change some of the decisions that Detroit has made in the past, that have come to reckoning now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think the President -- the President understands that whether it\'s financial stability, whether it\'s banks and the lending system, whether it\'s the auto companies, there can\'t -- there can\'t be a bottomless pit to this.\xc2\xa0 There\'s just not the resources to deal with it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what you saw yesterday, the submissions and the requests for another, I guess, $14 billion, will the car companies get it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that many people at Treasury were up well into the night evaluating those plans.\xc2\xa0 They continue to be evaluated.\xc2\xa0 The President will convene a meeting of the Task Force on Autos late this week, the first meeting of that task force to begin to go through those in more depth.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Treasury is reaching out to -- after reviewing those reports, reaching out to the companies themselves for a greater understanding in what they\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 But a lot of that analysis is ongoing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on the auto stuff yet, on a preliminary basis?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Both -- some yesterday and more today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Geithner is on the plane today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you mean when you say Treasury has reached out to the auto companies?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, Treasury wants to -- and members of the Auto Task Force are going to talk to the companies about what\'s contained in their plans -- just a greater understanding.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t mean to imply anything greater than --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they looking for more details?\xc2\xa0 Is there something missing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s just -- I think it\'s talking through what\'s in their plans.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, without prejudging their analysis, there\'s obviously a lot of work left to do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to make a decision on extra aid?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he would want a better evaluation of those plans and a meeting of the task force before we make any announcements on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously many of these problems are urgent.\xc2\xa0 We have to make sure -- obviously there\'s a big restructuring that has to -- is likely going to take place.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you were asked a couple times yesterday about the President\'s reaction to revelations about Roland Burris.\xc2\xa0 Have you had a chance to talk with him?\xc2\xa0 Does he have a reaction?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have to say, I\'ve neglected to speak with him.\xc2\xa0 But I will give you this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the people of Illinois have been through a lot in the past few weeks.\xc2\xa0 And obviously Senator Burris was seated based in some way on the representations that he made to the U.S. Senate and to the committee in Illinois investigating Governor Blagojevich, and as well in interviews to the people of -- that the people of Illinois heard.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think in many ways he was seated based on those representations, and I think that the people of Illinois deserve -- deserve to know, based on some of the things that have happened over the past few days, deserve to know the full extent of any involvement.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s likely to come out as part of some of the investigations that are now ongoing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s already acknowledged that the extent of his contacts with Governor Blagojevich were substantially more than what he originally owned up to.\xc2\xa0 Should he resign?\xc2\xa0 There have been calls for that from both sides of the aisle in Illinois.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get ahead of investigations and say anything like that yet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say, though, that you\'re suggesting that Mr. Burris misrepresented his involvement before?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I wouldn\'t suggest -- I think you should quote what I said.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See you in the morning?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, one more question.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to continue travel at this pace, the pace he set last week and this week?\xc2\xa0 That\'s a personal question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For me, too.\xc2\xa0 You know, I think the President has spoken about what he believes is -- he believes there\'s a lot of benefit to getting out of Washington at least once a week and meeting with and seeing the problems that Americans are dealing with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">He was fortunate enough to be able to do that for two years on a campaign, and I think he would tell you that the experiences and the stories that he heard help every day in him crafting and thinking about the solutions to the problems that many of those people face.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I don\'t anticipate that we\'ll do this three days a week, but I do think he will definitely want to do this once a week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more detail about the fiscal summit on Monday?\xc2\xa0 Who will be attending --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me -- I think I got an email on that, and I\'ll -- so I don\'t mess up some of the people that might be there, let me go check on that.\xc2\xa0 All right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">And then in terms of tomorrow, I don\'t -- I assume -- I don\'t know what time we\'re leaving.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s a fairly decent hour in the morning.\xc2\xa0 So I will talk to you guys -- my assumption is -- on the way back from Canada.</div> <div class="legacy-para">All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So talking not on the way up, but probably on the way back?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Probably on the way back, but we\'ll play it by ear and see if --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How early is it in the morning, do you know?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thought we were leaving at 9:00 a.m.-something, but maybe -- all my schedules sort of blur together.\xc2\xa0 Let me go see if I can get a better read.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 4:11 P.M.
