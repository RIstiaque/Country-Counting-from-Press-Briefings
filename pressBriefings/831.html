Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t11:33 A.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, hello, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here this morning -- still morning.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate, as ever, you coming to the briefing.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements, so we\'ll go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen the video that\'s caused a lot of people to be talking this morning -- the 47 percent video? And if so, what\'s his reaction to it?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this.\xc2\xa0 The campaign has put out a statement and I\'m sure others from the campaign will be asked about and will address it.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll limit what I say in response to questions about it.\xc2\xa0 What I\'ll say is this:\xc2\xa0 When you\'re President of the United States you are President of all the people, not just the people who voted for you.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard the President say so many times because he deeply believes it that we\'re in this together, all of us.\xc2\xa0 From the time he began his career in public service, from the time that those of us in this room first heard of him in 2004, his message has been about the fact that what unites us as Americans is far greater than the things that divide us.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s fundamental to who this President is, and it\'s fundamental to what guides him as he makes decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen he made the decision against the advice of many to take action to save the auto industry, the President did not ask whether the 1.1 million Americans whose jobs would be saved had voted for him or against him.\xc2\xa0 When he pressed for 18 small business tax cuts he didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask if small businessmen and women were Democrat or Republican.\xc2\xa0 When he fought to pass health care reform he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder whether the 129 million Americans with preexisting conditions who would be helped by this reform, who would be given security through the reform, were likely to be with him or against him in 2012.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just not how he thinks.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the way you have to approach the job is with a keen understanding that you\'re out there fighting for every American.\xc2\xa0 And this President\'s agenda has always been about building the middle class, strengthening the middle class, bringing people up into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what it will be going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President actually watched the video?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other follow on this.\xc2\xa0 One of the comments from Governor Romney in the fundraiser was that 47 percent who support President Obama believe they are victims.\xc2\xa0 Putting aside just the campaign politics if you need to, does the White House think that that kind of statement has policy implications that would affect how Governor Romney would run the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, setting aside what Governor Romney thinks, I can tell you that the President certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that men and women on Social Security are irresponsible or victims; that students are irresponsible or victims.\xc2\xa0 He certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that middle-class families are paying too little in taxes.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, the broader point that you always hear him make is that we need to come together as a country.\xc2\xa0 We need to work together for what\'s best for the country and best for especially the middle class, which is the backbone of this nation.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us a little bit more about how the President himself reacted to the video, whether or not he\'s seen it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know if he\'s seen it and I don\'t have any discussions with him about it to read out to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us if he talked about it with senior staff this morning or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to read out any internal conversations about that or other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me switch to a policy question then.\xc2\xa0 There\'s some volatility in the oil markets yesterday and today.\xc2\xa0 Some of that some people are saying was due to speculation about an imminent SPR move.\xc2\xa0 Number one, can you give us any update on your SPR thinking?\xc2\xa0 And number two, can you tell us if there was any sort of intel that showed -- may have shown that yesterday\'s drop was a technical glitch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me refer questions about the market yesterday to the CFTC.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the appropriate agency to refer those questions to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur position on the SPR is what it has been, which is that we monitor the situation regularly and constantly together with our international partners and we continue to say that all options remain on the table.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any announcements to make today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have -- has the President, has the White House been watching the oil markets in general?\xc2\xa0 Even if you don\'t want to speak specifically to yesterday\'s move, any update in your thinking about just developments there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you saw in May at the G8, and, more recently, finance ministers for the G7, this is something that is regularly monitored and discussed by the United States with its international partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can say that in terms of more recent developments, the administration welcomes the Saudi Arabian oil minister\'s recent remarks and share his concern about rising oil prices in the international oil market.\xc2\xa0 We also welcome Saudi Arabia\'s continued commitment to take all necessary steps to ensure the market is well supplied and to help moderate prices.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we have also said for some time, the administration continues to take steps to expand domestic oil and gas production, which has increased each year the President has been in office.\xc2\xa0 In fact, as you know, U.S. oil production is currently at an 8-year high and domestic natural gas production is at an all-time high.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But gas prices are going up in the U.S. right now.\xc2\xa0 Is that something you\'re concerned about or looking at any additional measures to address?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With regards to the international oil market and oil prices, we monitor them constantly with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that we keep very close track of.\xc2\xa0 And we retain the right to keep all options for dealing with those issues on the table, and that includes SPR.\xc2\xa0 But I have no announcements of any action that may or may not be taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Mary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President also had his fair share of private moments that have later been made public.\xc2\xa0 During the 2008 election, he said that rural voters "get bitter" and they cling to their guns or religion.\xc2\xa0 Like Mr. Romney, this was also said privately to donors and then later made public after the fact.\xc2\xa0 Rural voters certainly aren\'t 47 percent of the electorate, but they are a large demographic.\xc2\xa0 How is Mr. Romney\'s comments any different from what the President said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that happened four years ago and was discussed in abundance at the time.\xc2\xa0 What the President said four years ago, what he said eight years ago, what he says today and what he said ever since he took office here is that he\'s fighting for every American, that he firmly believes that as a nation we\'re all in this together, that what unites us is far stronger and greater than what divides us, that we\'re not red America and blue America, we\'re the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that that\'s a fundamental fact about Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s been the guiding philosophy and principle behind the policy decisions he\'s made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, again, citing some of the examples from what he\'s done in office, when he took action to ensure that our financial markets, our financial sector did not collapse, he didn\'t check to see whether the people who would most directly benefit from that were supporters or not.\xc2\xa0 He took a lot of grief for that, but he did it because he thought it was right for the American economy and right for all Americans that we do not experience the collapse of an important sector of our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe same thing with the auto industry -- he didn\'t ask if autoworkers were supporters, he didn\'t ask if auto executives were supporters.\xc2\xa0 He did what he believed was right for the country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s been his guiding principle.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think he talked about this in Charlotte, that the people who inspire him, the people who give him hope, he doesn\'t know whether they\'re voting for him.\xc2\xa0 The soldier he first met at Walter Reed who lost a leg, he doesn\'t know; the gentleman who won the lottery and kept working and bought flags for his town.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the sort of essence of the American story that inspires him every day.\xc2\xa0 And it does not matter to him whether they\'re Republican or Democrat or independent, because we\'re all in this together.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The campaign said, in their response to Mitt Romney\'s statements, that it\'s hard to serve as President for all Americans when you\'ve disdainfully written off half the nation.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve said repeatedly now that the President obviously does represent all Americans.\xc2\xa0 Why is that any different from Mitt Romney when he makes a comment like this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\'s the question again?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question being that if the President can make a comment like he did in 2008, where he sort of offended a large -- I don\'t want to say "offended," but where he made a remark in direct relation to a large portion of the electorate, and Mitt Romney makes a similar remarks also offending or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Then-Senator Obama never said that he did not worry about or would not worry about 47 percent of the population.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tA lot of folks, when we travel around the country ask why the President is campaigning on a bus in towns and communities and counties that trend red or Republican.\xc2\xa0 Why is he there if he\'s not likely to win the count?\xc2\xa0 Because he\'s there to take his message about his economic vision and his agenda for the country to everybody, because he firmly believes that building this country up helps everybody.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard him talk about it, that if we do the right things for our economic policy, if we take a balanced approach to dealing with our fiscal challenges, if we reduce spending, reform our entitlements, ask millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more, that everybody will benefit, including millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the essence of his governing philosophy and it\'s at the core of who he is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one more question, just on a different topic? It seems that the U.S. and Libya have sort of different accounts of the attack in Benghazi last week.\xc2\xa0 There are reports that Libyan officials warned the U.S. of the growing extremist threat prior to the attacks, that they admitted they could not control some of these militias.\xc2\xa0 That seems to run counter to what administration officials have been saying, that this was just a spontaneous reaction to this anti-Islam film.\xc2\xa0 Can you kind of reconcile this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is that we have provided information about what we believe was the precipitating cause of the protest and the violence, based on the information that we have had available.\xc2\xa0 There is an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 The FBI is investigating.\xc2\xa0 And that investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we do know about Libya is that it\'s a country that emerged from war and revolution, and you have a new government trying to assert its authority as that country makes a transition to democracy and broader representation for all Libyans and broader rights for all Libyans.\xc2\xa0 And in that environment there are certainly, in this postwar, post-revolution environment, there are vast numbers of weapons and certainly a number of violent groups in the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is important to note, however, is that the Libyan people do not understand -- or rather they do understand that the United States was with them in their efforts to achieve their aspirations, to rid them of the Qaddafi regime and the tyranny that Qaddafi inflicted upon them.\xc2\xa0 But it is still a very volatile place, there\'s no question about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNancy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to Mary\'s question for one moment -- did the President regret making those comments about guns and religion?\xc2\xa0 Did he learn something from the fallout?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nancy, again, these are comments that happened four years ago.\xc2\xa0 There has been plenty of ink spilled and plenty of things said about them four years ago.\xc2\xa0 I know that fundamentally what the President was saying four years ago, what he was saying in 2004, and what he\'s saying today is entirely consistent, which is that as a country we are united by far stronger stuff than the things that divide us, that he is out there fighting for every American, regardless of whether or not they support him politically or support the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is really the essence of who he is as a public official, that that\'s his guiding principle.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s reflected by everything I\'ve just talked about.\xc2\xa0 The policies that he\'s pursued have sometimes earned him criticism from left or right or center, precisely because he\'s not evaluating when he makes those decisions whether the people who are helped by them are supporters, or people who voted against him or will vote against him.\xc2\xa0 He is guided by what he thinks is best for the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he firmly believes that outside of the rancor in Washington, while people have very firmly held positions and opinions and it is a country that tends to be relatively divided between the two parties when we have national elections, that on the stuff that matters to Americans\' day-to-day lives, we\'re a lot more united than we sometimes perceive here in Washington, and that the President believes that in his bones and it\'s what guides him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about something else that Governor Romney said and get your take from a policy perspective.\xc2\xa0 On the Middle East peace process, he said the "Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish."\xc2\xa0 Does the President share this view about the Middle East?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes and is committed to working with -- the President believes and is committed to the principle that a two-state solution is the right solution for Middle East peace.\xc2\xa0 That is a basic tenet that has been pursued by Democratic and Republican administrations prior to President Obama.\xc2\xa0 And his two immediate predecessors worked on this issue under the firm belief that a two-state solution was the right solution, and it\xe2\x80\x99s what has guided this President.\xc2\xa0 So I think his view is a little different from what was expressed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney said that this is likely to remain an \xe2\x80\x9cunsolved problem.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Given recent history in the Middle East, is he wrong about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult problem I think we can all agree on.\xc2\xa0 That it is a challenge that previous Presidents of both parties have embraced because they believe it\xe2\x80\x99s right for the country, they believe it\xe2\x80\x99s right for American interests, for the interests of Israelis, the interests of Palestinians, is also true.\xc2\xa0 And it is simply the wrong approach to say we can\'t do anything about it, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll just kick it down the field.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not leadership.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the opposite of leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this President has been working on this issue since the day he took office.\xc2\xa0 It is a tough issue, but ultimately peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, a negotiated peace that provides security for Israel and a state for the Palestinians, is in the interest of the Israelis and the Palestinians, and is in the interest of the United States of America, and this President will continue to pursue it.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to Libya.\xc2\xa0 On September 10th, you put out a press release saying that the President had a meeting with senior officials to figure out the security posture around the 9/11 anniversary.\xc2\xa0 And in that press release you said that \xe2\x80\x9csteps were taken to protect U.S. persons and facilities abroad.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated that departments and agencies must do everything possible to protect the American people both at home and abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So in retrospect, given the tragedy, did the administration drop the ball on what you promised on September 10th that you had improved security at these installations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They were numerous steps taken, as there have been every year on the anniversary of 9/11, and as there have been at different times on the calendar when it is judged by the experts that taking additional steps, security steps, is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 As for specific measures taken at specific facilities, diplomatic facilities, I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separate from the FBI investigation you mentioned to Mary a few moments ago, is there any sort of inquiry going on here at the White House among the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team to get to the bottom of -- you told the American people on September 10th, "We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken steps to protect Americans here at home and abroad."\xc2\xa0 Obviously, with four Americans tragically being killed, the steps were not good enough.\xc2\xa0 So is there an inquiry going on here to figure out what went wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99re conveniently conflating two things, which is the anniversary of 9/11 and the incidents that took place, which are under investigation in terms of what --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which happened on the anniversary.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- which are under investigation, and the cause and motivation behind them will be decided by that investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is certainly -- I would point you to what Ambassador Rice said and others have said about what we know thus far about the video and its influence on the protests that occurred in Cairo, in Benghazi and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And all I can tell you is that steps are taken, both seen and unseen, in advance of and in preparation for times like the anniversary of 9/11 when it is judged that there might be greater threats.\xc2\xa0 And those steps are based on the threat assessments that we have at the time.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you in terms of specific security for specific facilities to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to say there was enough security in Benghazi are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am simply saying that this is a matter under investigation.\xc2\xa0 It is an absolute tragedy that we lost four Americans in Benghazi, including our ambassador, including security personnel.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an active investigation underway into what happened and why, and what the motivations were, and driven by the absolute commitment that this President made to finding who was responsible and holding them accountable and bringing them to justice.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s very important.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Mary asked as well whether or not there was sort of any heads-up for the administration that there was violence coming in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Reuters reported that the U.S. embassy in Cairo got a heads-up that there was a cable that went around suggesting that violence was increasing around the U.S. embassy there.\xc2\xa0 There were other reports suggesting that the U.S. installation in Benghazi in Libya had up to three days\xe2\x80\x99 notice that violence was increasing.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear an answer to that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand -- to that question.\xc2\xa0 Did the administration have any sort of heads-up that violence was increasing specifically in Libya before the attack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any, Ed.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter that\xe2\x80\x99s under investigation in terms of what precipitated the attacks, what the motivations of the attackers were, what role the video played in that.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen is broad unrest across the region and elsewhere in response to this video, which we have made clear we view as reprehensible and disgusting, and a video that is in no way connected to the United States government and does not reflect the values that we hold as a people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the video led protesters to get rocket-propelled grenades --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I know, Ed, and I know you know is that Libya, as I just said, is a very volatile place that has just gone through a revolution and a war, and where there is an abundance of weapons, including heaving weapons.\xc2\xa0 And there are certainly groups that carry those weapons and look to take advantage of circumstances, as there are around the region and the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have seen circumstances in the past, in other parts of the region, where incidents that inflame opinion are taken advantage of and exploited by groups that have an interest in creating chaos and destabilizing either a local government or attacking the West or the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen certainly for the past number of years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. is suspending training for new Afghan recruits.\xc2\xa0 How big of a setback will this be for the withdrawal timeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the military continues to work to understand why there has been a spike in the kinds of attacks, the so-called green-on-blue attacks, in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Afghanistan to take measures to better protect our troops.\xc2\xa0 In that vein, General Allen has directed all of his operational commanders to review their force protection and tactical activities in light of the current circumstances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a result of that directive, ISAF directed a change in the level at which advising and partnering takes place; most partnering and advising will now be at the battalion level and above.\xc2\xa0 This does not mean that there will be no partnering below that level.\xc2\xa0 The need for that will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMore broadly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy of gradually turning over security lead to Afghan forces continues, and that is part of a broader strategy that has to -- that will result in more American troops coming home and Afghans taking more and greater responsibility for the security of their nation, and that process continues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, handover of power is such a key part of the withdrawal process, so how can this not impact the overall timeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the timeline.\xc2\xa0 I think the issue here is partnering with our Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what General Allen was addressing and ISAF was addressing.\xc2\xa0 And part of this process obviously is training up Afghan security forces so that they are in a position to capably take over responsibility for their own security.\xc2\xa0 That partnering continues with the changes in directives that I just talked about.\xc2\xa0 But the transition that the President has laid out will absolutely continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\'s been described as a temporary suspension.\xc2\xa0 Can you characterize what temporary means?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s obviously something that\'s based on the judgments made by commanders in the field as well as officials at the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you point out you\'re suspending training of the new recruits, but the Afghan army, the national police trained by NATO are not going to be affected by this suspension.\xc2\xa0 So how can you have confidence that they won\'t --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s a question best addressed to ISAF as well as to the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 Our commanders are keenly focused on security for our troops and are taking steps that they believe are necessary to enhance that security and to reduce the incidents of these so-called green-on-blue attacks.\xc2\xa0 For their specific views on how these measures will achieve that I would refer you to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just have one more, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post is reporting that due to the protests in Cairo and the Middle East, negotiations have stalled in terms of talking about increased aid to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The reports that we have cut off aid, which is the report that I saw, to Egypt are completely incorrect.\xc2\xa0 We\'re continuing to work with the Hill on ways to support a stable, democratic transition in Egypt that is important for defeating extremism of the very kind that we just recently saw.\xc2\xa0 We provide assistance to Egypt because it\'s in our interest to help them advance regional security and uphold their treaty with Israel and transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that process, as I said, continues, and we\'re working with the Hill to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I know you can\'t say whether the President watched the video, but do you know if he\'s aware of Governor Romney\'s remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve said frequently that the President keeps abreast of the news.\xc2\xa0 I expect that he is aware of that news.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Expect" -- pretty strong, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he\'s aware of what -- (laughter) -- of news that reaches a level that it\'s the first thing I\'m asked about at the briefing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 General Dempsey said yesterday that the green-on-blue attacks pose a very serious threat to the campaign in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Has that been communicated to the President and does he agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would have to look at the entirety of General Dempsey\'s comments.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question that the steps that are being taken by our commanders, by General Allen, by ISAF, in reaction to these reflect serious concern about the increase in these attacks.\xc2\xa0 And it is their commitment and the President\'s commitment that we take the steps necessary to enhance security for our forces in Afghanistan even as we continue with the mission, which is a very important mission of partnering with and training Afghan security forces so that they can gradually, as they are now, take security responsibility for their own country.\xc2\xa0 And as they do that American forces will continue to come home.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the timeline is more affected by (inaudible) the training, does that mean that the quality of the forces that are left behind with the Afghans will be less?\xc2\xa0 And does that mean that the state of the country that NATO is going to leave behind is going to be a worse state than had hoped?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important to point you to a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, what I think Kristen mentioned, this is viewed as a temporary measure, a temporary change in directive, and it is also important to note that partnering will continue at the battalion level and up and at lower levels as judged on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the partnering relationship continues.\xc2\xa0 It is important to the process of transitioning security lead over to the Afghans so that our men and women can come home.\xc2\xa0 And that process continues.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there a policy about donors bringing recording devices into presidential events that are closed to the press?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'ve been to many of them where there are closed press events where the President takes questions from donors and the like.\xc2\xa0 Would you say he\'s more forthcoming when there\'s no press there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I\'d say at these events the President speaks and the press pool is there when he addresses --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not for the Q&amp;A part.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I agree with that, and I would say that that President\'s message is consistent whether he\'s talking to donors or to grassroots supporters or to people at an official event on policy matter.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s fair to say that when the President speaks to wealthier Americans who are supporters, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that he believes we need to take a balanced approach to our fiscal challenges, and that includes asking millionaires and billionaires -- including millionaires and billionaires who might be in the room -- to pay a little extra.\xc2\xa0 And his supporters who fall into that category are aware of that and they\'ve made the decision that for the good of the country that policy is the right policy moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President\'s message is clear and he takes it to all Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it goes to what I was talking about earlier, that he really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that dividing us into categories and groups is the right way to move forward as a nation.\xc2\xa0 And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time thinking about what policies he\'s pursuing -- about the policies he\'s pursuing and whether or not they benefit specific individuals who may or may not, or groups of individuals who may or may not have supported him in 2008 or will support him in 2012.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe thinks that the best politics is the right policy, and the best policy are the policies that move the country forward, that makes sure that more Americans are getting educated, that more middle-class Americans have work, that they have security -- health care security and retirement security -- and that we\'re taking steps to develop alternative energy so that we can enhance our energy independence, and that we\'re investing in research and development and infrastructure so that our country has the economic foundation it needs to move forward so that everybody benefits, everybody from the factory floor to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if there\'s no change in tone or substance, why are they closed to the press?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have taken steps to have the press participate in these events.\xc2\xa0 I spent a lot of time on driveways, in vans as a reporter for this President\'s predecessors, covering this President\'s predecessors, when the press pool was not allowed in.\xc2\xa0 And as you --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, I\'ll bet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it depended on whether or not there were beverages served.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is now the time to bring up your April 14 column from 2008 when you said the President\'s words were poorly chosen on the guns and bitter?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember that column.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\'t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can read the whole thing for you if you want.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President, then candidate, addressed this at the time -- this was four years ago -- and I think the broader point is that his message there and everywhere in 2008, and going back to 2004, and every day since, has been consistent, which is that we\'re in this together, all of us, and that his interest is in moving the entire country forward in ways that benefit senior citizens on Social Security, students who are getting student loans, combat veterans -- I mean, combat troops as well as veterans -- everybody in this country is I think working towards the same goal, which is advance moving the country forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the vast majority of people, this President believes, are hardworking, responsible, committed to their families and committed to their country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the animating principle behind his politics and his policies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President mention it in his fundraisers tonight, the Romney remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any previews for you on the President\'s remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to the conflict between -- the conflicting reports I guess between the administration and Libyan officials over what happened.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, you seemed to cite that the videos were definitely part of it, but I get the sense that you\'re backing away from that a little bit today.\xc2\xa0 Is there something that you\'ve learned since?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 I think what I am making clear and what Ambassador Rice made clear on Sunday is that reaction to the video was the precipitating factor in protests in violence across the region.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m also saying is that we have -- we made that assessment based on the evidence that we have, and that includes all the evidence that we have at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\tI am not, unlike some others, going to prejudge the outcome of an investigation and categorically assert one way or the other what the motivations are or what happened exactly until that investigation is complete.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot suppositions based on the number of weapons and other things about what really happened in Benghazi and I\'d rather wait, and the President would rather wait, for that investigation to be completed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not ruling out that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not ruling out -- if more information comes to light, that will obviously be a part of the investigation and we\'ll make it available when appropriate.\xc2\xa0 But at this time, as Ambassador Rice said and as I said, our understanding and our belief based on the information we have is it was the video that caused the unrest in Cairo, and the video and the unrest in Cairo that helped -- that precipitated some of the unrest in Benghazi and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 What other factors were involved is a matter of investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about is this going to prompt any --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to the FBI for that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t keep timelines, FBI timelines at the ready.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned aid with Egypt and working with the Hill. Is this going to prompt any revisions or any review, I guess, of the President\'s policies toward the Arab Spring?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy towards the Arab Spring is that we support the democratic aspirations of the people of the region.\xc2\xa0 And the upheavals that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the region over the past several years have been in reaction to oppressive governments that do not respect the basic rights of their citizens.\xc2\xa0 In cases like in Tunisia and Libya and elsewhere, democratic transitions are underway.\xc2\xa0 They are in early stages, and there is a lot of volatility in these countries -- Egypt as well, of course.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our policy is geared towards supporting that transition in a way that enhances the prospects of democracy in the region and enhances the prospects that the countries in the region will continue to be -- either will continue to be or will grow to be supportive of the United States and our interests in the region and around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that policy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot of attention on the Supreme Court next week because they\'ll consider taking up several pending marriage cases related to both the Defense of Marriage Act and California\xe2\x80\x99s Proposition 8.\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department has already made its views known on the DOMA cases, but given the President\xe2\x80\x99s previously supported -- previously stated opposition to Prop 8 and support for marriage equality, does the administration want the Supreme Court to take up the Prop 8 case, making some national ruling on same-sex marriage?\xc2\xa0 Or as claimants in the case have requested, would you prefer that the Court allow the lower court ruling to stand and striking down the marriage ban just in California?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a question, and I will ask you to direct it to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make policy towards Supreme Court cases from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, though, I mean, would this President welcome the Supreme Court taking up a case that will enable it making a court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage across the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say on that at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Libya.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Rice says on Sunday that it was spontaneous, and then we hear from the State Department that there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough information to make the determination.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there is no shift, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that based on information that we -- our initial information, and that includes all information -- we saw no evidence to back up claims by others that this was a preplanned or premeditated attack; that we saw evidence that it was sparked by the reaction to this video.\xc2\xa0 And that is what we know thus far based on the evidence, concrete evidence -- not supposition -- concrete evidence that we have thus far.\xc2\xa0 But there is a lot that is under investigation here, and as more facts come to light, if they change that assessment, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make that clear.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s an active investigation for a reason -- so that we actually get the facts and don\xe2\x80\x99t base our policy prescriptions on suppositions about what we think we know happened as opposed to what actually happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the administration still say that it was spontaneous?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Based on the information that we have now, it was -- there was a reaction to the video -- there was protests in Cairo, then followed by protests elsewhere, including Benghazi, and that that was what led to the original unrest.\xc2\xa0 The other factors here -- all factors -- but the other factors here, including participants in the unrest, participants in the violence, are under investigation.\xc2\xa0 And the goal of that investigation is both to find out what happened and why, but also to track down and bring to justice those who killed four Americans.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our Libyan counterparts to ensure that that happens, as the President committed it would.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, administration officials will be on the Hill briefing members.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On what subject?\xc2\xa0 I think members of the administration brief members regularly on different --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I assume that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be briefing them on all the information we have up to the moment before they brief.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m reflecting at this time from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 As far as next week, how much is the President realistically going to be able to accomplish at the U.N. General Assembly with partners and allies when he\xe2\x80\x99s only going to be there for such a short time, and he\xe2\x80\x99s spending a lot of that on two big speeches?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is attending UNGA, as Presidents before him have during their reelection years, and he intends it to be a productive time spent at the U.N. General Assembly, as it was last year, as it was the year before and the year prior to that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific in terms of what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say at UNGA or what issues he\xe2\x80\x99s going to press, but you can be sure that he expects it to be a productive visit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s keeping him from extending the stay a little longer, like you would in other years, in order to have bilaterals and things like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re there for two days, which is the number of days we were there last year.\xc2\xa0 We were there for an overnight last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aung San Suu Kyi is in town for a few days.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President will be meeting with her while she\xe2\x80\x99s here.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements for the President at this time.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a change in that I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it to your attention.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.\xc2\xa0 Donovan, after Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on China.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, in addition to the trade news, Leon Panetta was in Japan.\xc2\xa0 The Japanese and the U.S. are cooperating on building this missile defense system, which prompted a lot of anxiety in China among analysts and some officials there who said they viewed it as being targeted or aimed at them.\xc2\xa0 Given that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had two major trade cases in the last few months and this, is there a concern that the message, the overall message the United States is giving to China is perhaps too tough?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd given that in the past when China has become a big issue in campaigns -- in \xe2\x80\x9992 and 1980 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s often led to very difficult period for whoever wins the election in actually dealing with China.\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all concerned that that precedent is being repeated now?*</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, with regards to China\xc2\xa0 -- his policies, because this is a broad and complex relationship -- are driven by what he believes are in the interests of the American people and the American economy as well as America\xe2\x80\x99s national security.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we have such a multifaceted, complex relationship with China that includes cooperation in a wide variety of areas, because cooperation is beneficial both to the United States and to China.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is why when we see instances or the USTR sees instances of unfair trade practices that are harmful to American workers and American businesses, this administration will act as it has to take cases before the WTO at twice the pace of the previous administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the President and senior members of his administration sit with their Chinese counterparts, they discuss all of these issues -- areas of disagreement as well as areas of agreement where they can work forward together.\xc2\xa0 And I have been in the room when the President has been with President Hu, and can testify to that fact that it is a very frank exchange about a variety of issues.\xc2\xa0 And we have a broad and important relationship with the Chinese that we expect will continue with this President after he\xe2\x80\x99s reelected, if in fact he is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the missile defense system, specifically, though -- what argument, what case would you make to Chinese analysts that are worried that somehow that represents (inaudible) China?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked into it to any degree so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that and get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tDonovan, I owe you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 A brief follow on Libya.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a little bit of confusion.\xc2\xa0 You guys have said that you\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with the Libyan government in the investigation and you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the information available to you guys so far has indicated that it\xe2\x80\x99s the film that prompted the violence.\xc2\xa0 And is the information different that you guys have than the Libyan government has?\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that the Libyan government is jumping to conclusions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not making a judgment on statements by others.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that, based on the information -- what we initially had available and have available -- we do not have any indication at this point of premeditation or preplanned attacks.\xc2\xa0 But it is under investigation and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- and that investigation will follow the facts wherever they go and wherever they lead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- we are working with the Libyans -- with the Libyan government in our pursuit of those who killed four Americans and our commitment to bringing them to justice, as well as to the broader -- within the broader investigation.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not casting judgment on others\xe2\x80\x99 assertions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying what we know and what we are working to find out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So have you guys ruled out premeditation or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying based on what we knew at the time, knew initially, what we know now, the facts that we have, the video was a precipitating cause to the unrest in the region and specifically in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Other factors involved in the violence that ensued -- other factors that are involved in that are under investigation and, again, the facts will be followed wherever they lead.\xc2\xa0 The point is that we\xe2\x80\x99re not making declarations ahead of the facts here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just telling you what we know based on the information we have at the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Kathleen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more bit on the Romney video.\xc2\xa0 The other remark he made was that he might have a better chance in the election if his parents were Mexican-born.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has seen that and if you had any reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did I have any reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll steer away from that, but thanks for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, has the President seen that, do you know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a discussion with him about the video so -- but I can boldly say that I am confident that he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, I hear that President Obama has extended sanctions against North Korea for one more year.\xc2\xa0 Is it related with the terrorist standards of the North Korean regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position with regards to North Korea is unchanged.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work with our international partners to pressure North Korea to get right with the international community, to abide by its obligations and, in doing so, to end its isolation, its profound isolation from the world.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that issue today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry -- go ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Burma for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Aung San Suu Kyi is in town.\xc2\xa0 How does the administration assess the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made in Burma toward more openness, more reforms?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the next step for the U.S. if that process continues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along that progress that is made towards openness and democracy and reform will be met with positive steps by this administration, this government in its dealings with Burma.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a step-by-step process.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have next steps to announce before they happen, but we\xe2\x80\x99re closely monitoring that progress and taking steps accordingly, as I think Secretary Clinton has been pretty explicit about in her recent comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:22 P.M.
