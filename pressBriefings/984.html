Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:39 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 Before I take questions let me read a brief announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, February 29th, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner at the White House to honor our armed forces who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn, and to honor their families.\xc2\xa0 This dinner, an expression of the nation\'s gratitude for the achievements and enormous sacrifices of the brave Americans who served in the Iraq war, and of the families who supported them, will include men and women in uniform from all ranks, services, states and backgrounds, representative of the many thousands of Americans who served in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe White House has been working with military and civilian leaders from the Department of Defense on this tribute, and we will release more details regarding the dinner when they become available.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you describing this as a state dinner --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair description, the sort of shorthand of saying a state dinner style?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\'s unique to the kind of dinner it is.\xc2\xa0 A state dinner has to do with heads of government, heads of state, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand the definition, but is it fair to -- similar formality?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be fancy like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it buffet?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When we have --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, using that shorthand would be incorrect or correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think state dinner probably is not quite accurate.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have more details to describe it for you.\xc2\xa0 It\'s really focused on the men and women who served in Iraq and in all stations within the armed services.\xc2\xa0 So I think one distinction might be that state dinners are about the elevated and important guests that we have visiting from other countries, and these would be for all those who served.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In Iraq, yes, this is Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of hundred people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the number on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the date again?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 February 29th.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Black tie?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that either.\xc2\xa0 I think the folks in uniform tend to wear their uniforms.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any dress or menu or entertainment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\'ll take questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.\xc2\xa0 Or I\'ll take more questions, rather.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Questions on Iran and Syria -- first on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Is what the President did today on broader sanctions and also the prospect of more sanctions this spring an indication that the White House is at all worried that Israel will act on its own on a military front before these really -- these sanctions have a chance to kick in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that it is reflective of the policy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken for quite a long time now in reaction to Iranian behavior, which is essentially a dual-track, where we continue to have an offer to the Iranians that if they get serious about their international obligations, if they respond to the letter from Lady Ashton about starting negotiations with the P5-plus-1, if they agree to give up their nuclear weapons ambitions, then there is an option for them to rejoin the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that and they\'ve so far refused to do that, and they continue to pursue a course that is dangerous, we will ramp up the effort to isolate and pressure the regime, working with our international allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President addressed the question regarding Israel during his interview with Matt Lauer over the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I mean, given that the development has happened today, or we learned about it today, about the additional sanctions --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can assure that the -- remember, Ben, that we have been -- there has been a steady increase in our sanctions activity, and this is part of that escalation and it\xe2\x80\x99s not related to -- specifically to that issue or the questions about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That issue about the Israel -- the Israeli --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria -- since we last saw you, the U.N. Security Council rejected the peace plan supported by the United States, pushed hard for by the United States.\xc2\xa0 Violence has continued.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we had the closing of the embassy.\xc2\xa0 And the President said in the NBC interview that he thinks that the noose is tightening on the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, what is that based upon?\xc2\xa0 It seems to a lot of outsiders that Assad is operating freely.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s no question that he is operating with gross disregard for the health and safety and welfare of his own people.\xc2\xa0 He is killing his own people.\xc2\xa0 And as we witness this, it only reinforces the need for the international community to act, and reinforces the disappointment we have with members of the United Nations Security Council who did not vote with the rest of the international community in favor of the anti-Syria resolution -- the anti-Syrian regime resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is that the pressure on Assad continues to intensify.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been -- he has dwindling financial resources.\xc2\xa0 He has dwindling access to what he needs to continue to govern.\xc2\xa0 His regime has lost control of parts of the country. There are a number of indications of the desire to depart from the regime by senior Syrian government and military officials.\xc2\xa0 These are telltale signs that Assad\'s future is very limited at best.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we continue to work with the international community to do everything we can to enhance the pressure on him, to make it clear to everyone that they should not want to place a bet on the Assad regime because that is a losing bet -- and it is a losing bet in pure realpolitik terms, but it\'s also a losing bet, obviously, in terms of being on the right side of the people of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last one on this.\xc2\xa0 Given that killing that you\'ve described, is the President personally frustrated with those who block the international effort, particularly China and Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that what I just said reflects our view, which is that those who voted against the resolution need to realize that betting everything on Assad is a recipe for failure -- not just for the interests of those countries, but for the stability of the region and for Syria\'s future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we\'ve seen, the video that we\'ve seen just most recently coming out of Syria demonstrates the appalling actions of the government forces.\xc2\xa0 And you have a great number of countries -- obviously the United States, Europe and Arab countries -- who see this for what it is.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with our international partners to make that case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 China was part of the double veto that was passed in the Security Council against the Syria resolution.\xc2\xa0 And of course this is one -- a little over one week before Chinese Vice President Xi visits Washington.\xc2\xa0 What, if anything, will President Obama have to say to the Vice President about this subject when they meet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have an agenda in terms of the discussions for those meetings.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\'ve made clear our disappointment that those votes were cast.\xc2\xa0 There\'s obviously a range of issues to be discussed in our bilateral relationship with China that will be discussed during that visit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would this have an impact on relations -- with either China or Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, we\'ve -- this is about what the international community\'s response to Syrian actions should be.\xc2\xa0 It has been -- there has been a great deal of collective action taken against the Syrian regime thus far; there will be greater action taken.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to work with all the friends of Syria and the Syrian people to continue to pressure the Assad regime, to continue to make clear that Assad\'s days are numbered.\xc2\xa0 I think that we will also, obviously, continue to work with the Chinese and the Russians on a host of other issues, even as we press this point, obviously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton did call on, as you mentioned, the friends of Syrian democracy to band together to help the Syrian opposition, political opposition.\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought being given to giving assistance, military assistance, to the rebels that are fighting Assad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the right solution in Syria is a political solution.\xc2\xa0 And there remains an opportunity for that to be achieved, for that transition to democracy to take place.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we felt, and we continue to feel, it\'s so important for the international community to act in the way that a Security Council resolution would have embodied.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue to work with our international partners in this regard -- because the best solution here is a political solution.\xc2\xa0 Broadly speaking, we take no options off the table.\xc2\xa0 But our focus is on using our diplomatic, economic and other means to help bring about and usher in a democratic transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we talk about Egypt?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we know how many Americans are actually in Egypt of those named in the judge\'s order?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into specifics about the order.\xc2\xa0 We\'re deeply disturbed by the crackdown against NGOs in Egypt, including the filing of charges against Americans.\xc2\xa0 Groups like the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, and many others, both American and Egyptian, have done nothing wrong.\xc2\xa0 Their only assignment is to support Egypt in its transition to democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese groups and individuals associated with them do not fund political parties or individual candidates.\xc2\xa0 Many of these groups have worked in Egypt for several years, and so their activities are not new.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, they also served as observers for the recent parliamentary elections at the request of the government of Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we continue to communicate at all levels with the Egyptian government on our grave concerns regarding the crackdown against NGOs in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We have underscored how serious a problem these actions are.\xc2\xa0 We have said clearly that these actions could have consequences for our relationship including regarding our assistance programs.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll continue to work with the Egyptians.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would it take to trigger a cutoff of the $1.5 billion of U.S. aid?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speculate about what that would be.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear that we take this very seriously, that it could have consequences -- these actions could have consequences for our relationship, including our assistance programs.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to speculate about what actions might precipitate a response on our part along those lines, except to say that we take this very seriously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is important to remember that these institutions have been over there for a number of years, they\'re all over the country promoting democracy, and that the individuals here have done nothing wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the people who were named are actually in the United States, some of the U.S. citizens, but some, obviously, are over there and we know that some are in the embassy.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any idea how many?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I don\'t want to get into specific numbers or names.\xc2\xa0 There are some Americans who have opted to stay in the embassy compound in Cairo while waiting for permission to depart Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t feel that it\'s wise to get into more details on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at what level are discussions about these people continuing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think at every level and very high levels.\xc2\xa0 You know that the President spoke with General Tantawi a number of days ago, and discussions from that level on down continue because we take this issue very seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to any of the top leadership --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any new communications involving the President to read out to you now.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that we are engaging with the Egyptian government on this issue at every level.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Get to Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we stay on the same -- stay in the region?\xc2\xa0 So yesterday in the interview with Matt, the President said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\'s Matt to you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He means Matt Lauer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So weird, just having a nice conversation here.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Carney.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The interview with Mr. Lauer, the President seemed to -- I guess correct me if I\'m wrong -- it sounded like the President was contradicting the intelligence report that the folks gave to Capitol Hill earlier in the week about this idea that Iran is looking for a way to attack the United States, which came out in an intelligence briefing to Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President seemed to say that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.\xc2\xa0 So what\'s -- it just sounded like a contradiction as far as the intelligence community is concerned.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know I\'m not going to get into, with any detail, discussions of intelligence regarding Iran or anywhere else from here.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that -- and I will just refer you to his comments about what he assesses and we assess their current intentions and capabilities to be.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we don\'t hear from a variety of channels, including very public ones, the negative intentions of certain Iranian leaders towards the United States and statements that can be bellicose or hostile.\xc2\xa0 However, I would just point you to what the President said about what his and our assessment of that capacity right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is -- Iran is a very dangerous place, it\'s a dangerous regime, and we take specifically the refusal to abandon their nuclear ambitions very seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President said Israel hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision yet about attacking Iran, it should be implied that the United States has made a decision that it\'s not going to happen in the next three months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\'t imply anything at all except to the explicit comment the President made, which -- well, two things -- one, we have greater military and intelligence cooperation with Israel than we have ever had, and that what he told NBC was that he believes that Israel has not made a decision about what action to take or whether or not to take the action that\'s been discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the United States made a decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to get into that kind of assessment.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that we believe that the course that we\'re pursuing with regards to Iran is the right one; that the sanctions have had significant impact on the Iranian economy. They have helped exacerbate tensions within the Iranian leadership that are now quite apparent, whereas when President Obama took office, Iran was unified and the world was not with regards to Iranian nuclear ambitions; the opposite is now true.\xc2\xa0 And that has had, I think, the effect of making clear to the world that the problem here is Iranian behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we will continue to pursue that course and press for change in behavior by the Iranian regime, even as, as the President has made clear on a number of occasions, we do not remove any options from the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you taking credit for that?\xc2\xa0 Are you taking credit for the tensions within the Iranian leadership?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that they contribute to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, I know.\xc2\xa0 But are you saying that your policies have helped exacerbate the tensions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Contribute to -- there is no question that the impact of the isolation on Iran and the economic sanctions on Iran have caused added turmoil within Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that has had an impact at a variety of levels, most demonstrably on the economy and on the currency.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, again, the unity that Iran enjoyed, if you will, with regards to this issue three years ago has gone, and the -- by contrast, the international community has united behind the position that the President has taken with our allies and partners to pressure Iran, to try to force Iran to change its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we go back to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Wendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Israel, can I --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just go -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work my way back to you, Connie.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Syria and Egypt -- Secretary Clinton has called for -- suggested the formation of a contact group of like-minded nations to step up the pressure on Assad\xe2\x80\x99s regime.\xc2\xa0 Have you begun preparing for that?\xc2\xa0 How would it work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the State Department for more details.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have been working very closely with a number of partners and allies both in the region and around the world as we have worked to put pressure on Assad, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re carefully considering a full range of options, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work closely with our allies and others to help the people of Syria put an end to this criminal regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest how that might be more effective than what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing a variety of means to put pressure on the Assad regime, to isolate it further.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact is Assad is running out of money, and we will make sure -- we will work, rather, to make sure that he is unable to finance his continued crackdown.\xc2\xa0 And that involves coordination with our allies and partners -- those who believe, as we do, that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Assad to go, because the Syrian people deserve a transition to democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about weapons and the ability to sell weapons to the Syrians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we believe that a political solution is the right course here and that that opportunity remains.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we need to act.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we felt that the United Nations Security Council should act.\xc2\xa0 But we are continuing to work with our international allies and partners who believe, as we do, that the behavior of the Assad regime is unacceptable and reprehensible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the charges against NGOs in Egypt, can we assume that prosecution would cross a line?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, I don\'t want to, again, speculate about what actions would prompt what reactions.\xc2\xa0 We are deeply concerned about the crackdown against NGOs.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned about the ability of Americans to -- who have done nothing wrong -- to leave the country.\xc2\xa0 And we are working at every level of the Egyptian government to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the Egyptian government know what would affect U.S. aid?\xc2\xa0 Has it been made clear to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have made clear, both in our public statements and in our private communications, how seriously we take this and that these actions could have consequences for our relationship and for our assistance programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, two days ago, the U.S. failed to get action at the highest global diplomatic forum there is, the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 Have you given up on the Security Council?\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\'s a chance that you could go back to the Security Council?\xc2\xa0 And what does it do to have you evacuate the American embassy in Damascus today?\xc2\xa0 What point does that make?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll start with the second part.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\'ve been drawing down our personnel at the embassy for some time because of security concerns, and that is why we have closed that embassy today.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Ford and all American personnel have now departed the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a reflection of the situation in Syria with regards to the safety of those individuals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to work at every level to coordinate with those who believe, as we do, that action needs to be taken; that we cannot -- that it is not the right course to help prop up the Assad regime, that we need to continue to put pressure on him and his cronies, if you will, and to further isolate him, limit his access to financial resources, and therefore make it harder and harder for him to maintain this crackdown.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\'s lost control of part of the country already.\xc2\xa0 And we will work with all friends of Syria -- of the Syrian people, rather -- to mount the pressure on Assad going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that kind of political resolution of it, President Obama is willing to wait it if takes weeks, months, a year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to speculate on how this will play out.\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that we need to act to allow a peaceful political transition to go forward before the regime\'s escalating violence puts a political solution out of reach.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you be specific at all about any conversations that the President might have had with his allies, including Prime Minister Cameron or President Sarkozy or Chancellor Merkel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new conversations to read out. We are obviously coordinating with all of our international allies and partners both at the United Nations and within the region.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tJackie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When Prime Minister Netanyahu comes to this country to speak to APEC, will he also be meeting with the President?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling update for you on that, but I\'m sure we\'ll have something for you in due time.</p>\n<p>\n\tConnie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President said something very important the other day.\xc2\xa0 He said the U.S. was walking in lockstep with Israel -- I believe that was his quote.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that the U.S. is coordinating with Israel on any strike against Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall the quote being quite as you described it.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is, the President made clear that our level of cooperation with Israel, militarily and in intelligence matters, has never been higher.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made that point repeatedly, because I think it demonstrates this country\'s commitment to Israel\'s security.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it does not -- obviously, Israel is a sovereign country and it has very legitimate concerns about Iran\'s development of a nuclear weapons capacity.\xc2\xa0 And we share those concerns -- there is no question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a question about a domestic issue, the contraception coverage debate?\xc2\xa0 It seems like the backlash not just among Catholic clergy but also liberal Catholics is growing. And I\'m wondering if the White House miscalculated when it seems to have not taken into account the reaction you would get, even from erstwhile allies of yours on this issue; and if there was any effort made to find a kind of middle ground, like asking employees of Catholic institutions to go out and buy a rider for contraceptive coverage if they want that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara, what I think is the case is that early on, after this decision was made, there was some misreporting about what it is and what it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I think lost in the initial reports is the fact that this policy provides for an exemption for churches and houses of worship -- and exemption that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in eight states in this country, including places like Georgia and Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 It did not make clear that there are 28 states that require these kinds of preventive services to be included in insurance policies for women, as this policy does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe sought a lot of opinion as this policy process took place and -- behind the idea of trying to find the right and appropriate balance between religious concerns, on the one hand, and the need to provide health care coverage to women across the country.\xc2\xa0 And here, I think is an important point to note, is that, again, churches, houses of worship are exempted from this policy.\xc2\xa0 Those institutions --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Catholic --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- where women of all faiths, many faiths, work need to have the same kind of coverage that all other American women have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we will continue for the coming year -- as I think also was a little bit lost in the coverage of this -- to work with those religious institutions to try to implement this policy in a way that ensures that women have access to preventive care, but tries to allay the concerns of these institutions -- because we take very seriously people\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs and their objections.\xc2\xa0 And that is the balance that we have sought in this policy, and it is the balance that we\'ll seek in these conversations going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in these conversations going forward, are you going to consider something like, I think the state of Hawaii has a opportunity for women to go and purchase a rider just for contraception if they want to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of beyond my policy expertise in terms of what kinds -- what could be contained within the conversation.\xc2\xa0 But I want to make clear that the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- or the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and the President concurs with it, is that this coverage needs to be available to all American women.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you looking at other ways of providing it that might have --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we will work with institutions to try to implement this is in a way that assures that the coverage is provided and that attempts to allay the concerns that are there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that we\'re on domestic topics -- on the unemployment numbers that came out on Friday, unaligned economists cheered them as very good news -- not to diminish that.\xc2\xa0 Still, there are 19 million underemployed or unemployed Americans.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House that these numbers will inevitably have to take a dip before we see real recovery as these people reenter the workforce?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there are -- some of those who I suppose don\xe2\x80\x99t wish us well politically have tried to make a point about this.\xc2\xa0 And the facts are that in these most recent numbers this is not an issue of people leaving the workforce, that the numbers are positive across the board.\xc2\xa0 Now, what we have said --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s a reality.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a political point to score.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a reality that people stopped looking for work and then they have to reenter.\xc2\xa0 So that not\xe2\x80\x99s point-scoring.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at some of the facts, which include that a number -- a large percentage of that is due to younger people getting more education, which in the end is an economic positive.\xc2\xa0 There are also -- there is a fact that this increase in the number of people leaving the workforce has been a trend and a fact since 2000 because of an aging population -- which is not to say that this is wholly -- it\'s not something that I would wholly disregard as an issue.\xc2\xa0 But the underlying fact here is that job creation remains the paramount objective in our economic policy, and should be the paramount objective of Congress as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think I have -- if those folks in the back are with me -- I have a slide I can point to you --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I might -- maybe not, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem familiar from tweets and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, the issue here is that everything we can do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who does the clicking on that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a magic clicker.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important to note here is the size of the hole we were in and the steady progress that has taken place since the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies have taken effect.\xc2\xa0 And we need to continue to work with Congress, for example, to extend the payroll tax cut through the end of the calendar year.\xc2\xa0 As the President said and has said, we need to do that without drama and without delay, and Congress needs to make sure that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to muck up the progress that we have made so far.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President was speaking to Mr. Lauer, he used the term -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Someday it will be Sir Lauer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Matthew to his mother.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he used the term "deserve."\xc2\xa0 I think he said, "I deserve a second term."\xc2\xa0 Does anyone deserve to be President?\xc2\xa0 What did he --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The point the President was making, I think, is one that this chart elucidates, which is that he has worked every day since he was sworn into office on his number-one priority, which he articulated even before he ran for President -- it was why he got into politics to begin with -- which is to ensure that those struggling to stay in the middle class, to better their lot, and those struggling to get into it, have been under pressure for quite a long time.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s determined, as President, to do everything he can to change that dynamic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when he came into office, we were in economic free-fall, as you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but the use of that word?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the context was based on his performance and his administration\'s performance on economic policy.\xc2\xa0 The question was, do you deserve reelection, and the issue is, since he came into office, a terrible trend has been reversed.\xc2\xa0 The problem is that the hole was so deep caused by the Great Recession that we still have a great deal of distance to travel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why we cannot reverse course.\xc2\xa0 We cannot allow Congress to muck up the progress we\'ve made.\xc2\xa0 We must extend the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 We must extend unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 And we must do the other things that the President put forward in the State of the Union that ensure that we have an America built to last -- that American manufacturing continues to rebound; 50,000 of those jobs, private sector jobs created last month were in American manufacturing, a sector that had been in chronic decline for many, many years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need to continue to develop the skills for American workers that will allow them to compete in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And we need to make sure that we do all of it as we return to the kind of American values that ensure that everybody gets a fair shot and that everybody plays by the same set of rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this can be a quickie.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice has been working with states\' attorneys general to get a housing settlement with some of the big banks, so they get off the hook on some things in exchange for creating a fund to help out hurting homeowners.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration making calls to some of the AGs who have refused to sign on to urge them to sign on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you on the so-called housing settlement.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important to note that, as I understand it, the settlement that we\'re talking about here has to do with robo-signing and those issues, and not the broader set of issues involved in mortgage-backed securities and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a progress update for you on that or any kind of details in terms of our engagement on the issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Roger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to yesterday and the Super Bowl -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Jay --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that gets to my question --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was born here, so I\'m a Redskins fan.\xc2\xa0 I know it\'s complicated, because I\'m a Red Sox fan, but that\'s because I didn\'t have a baseball team growing up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mean the team that beat the Giants twice?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Chrysler ad featuring Clint Eastwood --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right, the Redskins did beat the Giants twice.\xc2\xa0 Go figure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House or the campaign have any role in the creation of that ad, or advising on that ad, or consulting on the ad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you pleased with the ad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was news to me when I saw it.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you consider it an in-kind contribution from Clint Eastwood?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, the answer to your question, Roger, is no.\xc2\xa0 The ad points out, I think, what is significant -- a company that has rebounded obviously wants to sell more cars, and that\'s what advertising is about.\xc2\xa0 But it does point out a simple fact, which is that the automobile industry in this country was on its back, and potentially poised to liquidate three years ago, and this President made decisions that were not very popular at the time that were guided by two important principles:\xc2\xa0 One, that he should do what he could to ensure that 1 million jobs would not be lost; and two, that the American automobile industry should be able to thrive globally if the right conditions were created, and that included the kinds of reforms and restructuring that Chrysler and GM undertook in exchange for the assistance from the American taxpayer.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was not willing to allow -- did not believe it was necessary to allow the American automobile industry to collapse and disappear.\xc2\xa0 And so he made the decisions he made, and believes they were the right decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Back to Syria, please.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the Russians and probably the Chinese, too, say that they are not supporting the Syrian regime.\xc2\xa0 What they are supporting is the international legal regime -- the international legal norms that exist in relations between states.\xc2\xa0 They do not want anyone, including the United States, to pick a regime they don\'t like, inside rebelling against that regime or trying -- you understand what I am talking about.\xc2\xa0 Basically what you just presented to us was a rhetorical political, even economic aggression against a\xc2\xa0 regime.\xc2\xa0 My question is very simple:\xc2\xa0 What are the specific legal grounds on which you do this, you base this -- in the absence of a resolution?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei, I would refer you to the United Nations, to our mission there, and to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 What you saw, and what you see today, is a broad international consensus against the behavior of the Assad regime, the brutal killing of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 We think that\'s wrong.\xc2\xa0 And we agree with many of our partners and allies around the world and in the region when we say that.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the images that we\'ve seen just this weekend demonstrate that the kind of behavior being carried out by the Syrian forces under the control of the Assad regime is vile and unacceptable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that is why we supported the United Nations Security Council resolution, and it\'s why we\'ll continue to work with our allies and partners to further isolate and pressure the Assad regime, to allow the Syrian people the opportunity to choose their own future.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the approach we take.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if I may, one additional question.\xc2\xa0 I actually wanted to ask you about -- to remind you that lynching -- lynching is illegal in the United States.\xc2\xa0 You need to have a court of law.\xc2\xa0 But I will not ask about that.\xc2\xa0 I will ask you about -- can you tell me --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei, I feel like it might be 1982 and it\'s\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 Lynching is illegal.\xc2\xa0 Many like-minded people form a posse, hunt somebody down --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei, do you have a question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question.\xc2\xa0 The question is, can you assure me that you are not working inside Syria through your special forces -- whatever it is -- the working military?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, what\'s the question?\xc2\xa0 Are we --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the United -- can you tell me that United States is not taking any military steps to undermine the government --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve made very clear that we are pursuing a political and diplomatic course with regards to Syria. And we will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you were talking about Congress.\xc2\xa0 What, if anything, is new on the status of marching towards the expiration date for the payroll and UI and Medicare?\xc2\xa0 We\'re a couple weeks away from that.\xc2\xa0 What\'s been going on here to try to work towards a solution that doesn\'t end up with an 11th-hour crisis with the negotiations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we\'ve made clear, the President has made clear, that Congress needs to act without drama and without delay to ensure that the payroll tax cut is extended through the end of the year, that the unemployment insurance benefits are extended, and that the so-called doc fix is extended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, the kind of economic growth that I was just pointing out to you and the kind of job creation that we saw in January needs to be continued.\xc2\xa0 And in order to help that process forward, we in Washington shouldn\'t take steps that undermine economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And certainly a failure to extend the payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans would be just the sort of step that could do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re in conversations with folks on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 This is a process being led by the Hill.\xc2\xa0 It should be fairly simple.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see if that is in fact the case.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that everyone in Congress -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- should see it as the right thing to do to make sure that 160 million Americans don\'t have their taxes go up on March 1st, and to make sure at a macro level that steps are taken that ensure that we continue positive economic growth, and we continue positive job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tJerry, and then Leslie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, yesterday Governor O\'Malley mentioned that some of the reaction to the President\'s HHS policy was rooted in politics as opposed to in conscience.\xc2\xa0 Does the President accept that premise?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see those comments, and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was on CNN.\xc2\xa0 He was talking about the bishops\xe2\x80\x99 letters, and said that many of the bishops are Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have worked to find the appropriate balance between religious beliefs and the need to provide preventive services to American women, and to ensure that American women have access to those services regardless of where they work.\xc2\xa0 And we have carved out an exemption for churches and other houses of worship, and we will work, going forward, with institutions where the employer is affiliated with a church, for example, but where many, many of the employees are of all faiths, to find a way to ensure that the policy is implemented and that all women have access to these services that also deals with the concerns that have been expressed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But when you were answering the question to Mara you said that part of the reason that people are upset about this is because it\xe2\x80\x99s been misreported.\xc2\xa0 What he was saying is that it\xe2\x80\x99s also people with a political ax to grind --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t watch all the Sunday shows, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- I think what we see here is the need to find the appropriate balance between concerns on the one hand and the obligation to provide services to all American women.</p>\n<p>\n\tEleanor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You seem to be suggesting that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for some sort of a balance, that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a done deal.\xc2\xa0 And as part of that, how do you answer criticism that government is forcing religious institutions to pay for services they find morally objectionable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more of an answer, Eleanor.\xc2\xa0 I think that we decided, the administration decided, the President agrees with this decision, that we need to provide these services that have enormous health benefits for American women, and that the exemption that we carved out is appropriate. And we will continue to have discussions about ways that the implementation can be done that might address some of these concerns.\xc2\xa0 But the policy itself is clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The argument is over the fact that people don\xe2\x80\x99t consider it appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand that there have been objections and that some people disagree with us, and we are going to work with institutions that have concerns here.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that we believe that these services are important and that American women deserve to have access to that kind of insurance coverage regardless of where they work.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeslie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I wanted to go back to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday, she mentioned that the U.S. is going to seek regional cooperation on more sanctions, including to dry up the source of funding in arms shipments -- will work to expose those who are still funding the regime and sending them weapons.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on who the U.S. has identified in terms of sending the weapons --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t elaborate on identifying countries or individuals.\xc2\xa0 But I think that what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying here should echo what Secretary Clinton said about our approach going forward in trying to further isolate and pressure the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on China\xe2\x80\x99s Vice President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit.\xc2\xa0 Ben Rhodes said the other day the economy will definitely be on agenda.\xc2\xa0 And also, Jake Sullivan, from State Department, say North Korea and Iran would be on agenda.\xc2\xa0 So what else will be on the agenda?\xc2\xa0 And also, what will the President say to Mr. Xi on Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations or whatever comments he might make, or the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that we have an important and multilevel bilateral relationship with China and a number of issues are always on the agenda when we sit down with Chinese leadership, and that will be the case with this visit as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, all.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:24 P.M.
