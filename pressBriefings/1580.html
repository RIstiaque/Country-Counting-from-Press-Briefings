Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  1:54 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One quick announcement before we get started.\xc2\xa0 The United States will host the next G20 summit, September 24th through the 25th, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did I get a little murmur there?\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- there\'s a Terrible Towel back there somewhere, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the Pittsburgh summit, President Obama will meet with leaders representing 85 percent of the world\'s economy, take stock of the progress made since the Washington and London summits, and discuss further actions to assure a sound and sustainable recovery from the global economic and financial crisis.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why Pittsburgh?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At the conclusion of the meeting in London the group had to make a decision about where the next summit would be.\xc2\xa0 Because a lot of people will be in our country for the U.N. General Assembly meeting, the President offered to host the next meeting; the group agreed with that, and we identified Pittsburgh as a good place to do that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s an area that has seen its share of economic woes in the past but because of foresight and investment is now renewed -- giving birth to renewed industries that are creating the jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes it would be a good place to highlight some of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t it unusual to have two meetings in here?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For the G20?\xc2\xa0 This is -- they were going to do this at some point in the next -- after London, so it\'s not --it\'s on the regular schedule of things.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ms. Loven.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the concern among several -- many people in the abortion rights community about Judge Sotomayor, and I\'m wondering if you can respond to that and talk about -- I know you said there was no litmus test and no demand of an answer when the President interviewed her, but did he talk with her at all about her views on the constitutional right to privacy, sort of talk around the issue at all with her?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously -- and we talked about this throughout the process -- the President obviously is familiar with the Constitution and the teaching of constitutional law.\xc2\xa0 In their discussions they talked about the theory of constitutional interpretation, generally including her views on unenumerated rights and the Constitution and the theory of settled law.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He left very comfortable with her interpretation of the Constitution being similar to that of his, though the bulk of the conversation was about her approach to judging.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you put that into non-lawyer language since I\'m not a lawyer?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that he feels comfortable --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You should have seen the language that I had earlier.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\'s progress a little bit further.\xc2\xa0 Does it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Stare decisis was in the original --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, would unenumerated rights be sort of code for the right to privacy, since it\'s not enumerated in the Constitution?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think there was, as I said a minute ago, a general discussion about the constitutional interpretation, about how one viewed the document, and the President left very comfortable with the fact that -- she says a similar interpretation that he does.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he feels comfortable that she believes in a constitutional right to privacy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he feels comfortable with -- comfortable that she shares his philosophy generally on the Constitution.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think she should be asked about these issues at her hearing, whether she -- she should be asked about how she would rule?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President was careful not to, as previous Presidents have been careful not to ask and I think others have been at hearings careful not to, ask specifically how one might rule when a case comes -- in a case that could come before the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think the President felt comfortable with -- generally with her view and with, again, with her approach to judging.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People on the Hill are saying that the President plans an announcement on Monday on GM.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 And is he going to announce their bankruptcy filing, or is he going to leave that to the company?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the company will handle whatever announcements have to be made by the company on whatever day that happens.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not my job to prejudge or speculate on what the endgame of this might be.\xc2\xa0 I do expect that whatever happens as a result of the restructuring process, that the President will make comments on that presumably on Monday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just shifting gears a little bit, on the Cairo speech, you\'ve been very careful to say that the President is not going to lay out a Middle East peace plan --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but what is his message going to be there and how is it going to be different from what he said in Turkey?\xc2\xa0 His speech in Turkey was reaching out to the Muslim world and he did talk about his support for a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 So how is this going to be different?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, obviously there will be aspects of some of what you\'ve heard.\xc2\xa0 I think there will be -- we were in meetings about this last night, and I know the President has spent time over the course of the past week with his speechwriters, but a draft has not yet been birthed to the point of -- that he\'s had a chance to look at it.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t want to get ahead of that process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with Ayman Nour in Cairo when he goes there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the specific schedule yet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions, one following up on Jennifer\'s question.\xc2\xa0 During a Democratic primary debate, November 15th, 2007, then-Senator Obama said, "I would not appoint somebody who doesn\'t believe in the right to privacy."\xc2\xa0 And yet you\'re telling us right now that he has a general comfort with her view on the Constitution, but not necessarily with that quote -- not necessarily with the right to privacy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me be specific that he was not -- he did not specifically ask, as we\'ve stated for the past several days, but as I just said I think he feels -- I know he feels comfortable generally with her interpretation of the Constitution being similar to that of his.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does that mean that when he said "I would not appoint somebody who doesn\'t believe in the right to privacy," he didn\'t mean it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, Jake, I think he feels comfortable with where she is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 So to follow up, I looked at your "100 days, 100 projects" booklet yesterday and the very first one says, "Using $27 million of Recovery Act funding, a public housing development in D.C., the Regency House, has undergone a green retrofit.\xc2\xa0 As part of this upgrade, the building installed solar panels, a \'green\' roof, a rainwater collection system, energy-efficient lighting, as well as water-conserving toilets, showerheads and faucets."</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when I called the D.C. Housing Authority, they said only $59,000 was spent of stimulus money, not $27 million, and of the seven things mentioned, only two of the seven were actually --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the mistake in that one as you blogged about earlier took a series of different projects in a cut and paste into one.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so it wasn\'t as clear -- it wasn\'t as accurate as it could have been?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s accurate to say, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up again on the abortion issue and privacy.\xc2\xa0 Mark Knoller yesterday asked you a question about what the President may have said on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 You said you would look that up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Jake helpfully did that for us all today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I mean, this one was a little different than the one that Jake presented here, but it was talking about the campaign promise -- the President made it a campaign promise about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And the President said at this event in Florida that he "will stand up for choice."\xc2\xa0 He says, "I\'m a President who understands -- who understands that five men on the Supreme Court don\'t know better than women and their doctors and their pastors."\xc2\xa0 He goes on to say that, "that\'s why I\'m committed to appointing judges who understand how law operates in our daily lives."</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if the President is talking about it in these terms on the campaign trail, why wasn\'t it important for him to ask her about where she stood on abortion?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President believed it was exceedingly important to get her views on how she interprets the living document of the Constitution of the United States of America.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on that one question, why wouldn\'t he bring that question up?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'ve said for the last couple of days that he didn\'t ask the question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, because I think he feels comfortable in asking her to describe the way she interprets, to describe her views on that.\xc2\xa0 He felt comfortable that they shared a philosophy on that interpretation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, "don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\'t tell," when is the White House going to push Congress to repeal "don\'t ask, don\'t tell"?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ve done this answer a few times.\xc2\xa0 It is something the President supports.\xc2\xa0 He does not think the policy is working in the national interest, and he\'s working with the Joint Chiefs, the Pentagon and others to bring about a change in that policy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that issue, you actually mentioned the words --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which one?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on the same issue, on the Roe v. Wade privacy issue, you mentioned stare decisis.\xc2\xa0 That actually -- and I understand it\'s a legal term and maybe it would take some explanation -- but if they talked about stare decisis in the context of unenumerated rights and perhaps even the right to privacy, that might have given us a lot more information about what went on in this meeting.\xc2\xa0 So could you go back to that legal explanation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you, Chip, I\'m not going to get deeply into all the conversations that the President has had in private with prospective nominees.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said the President has been careful, and you\'re right, Presidents have been careful and they\'ve been careful on the Hill, too, not to ask -- well, they ask, but they don\'t get answers -- on cases that come before the Court.\xc2\xa0 But asking about a right to privacy and whether you agree on the right to privacy in the Constitution is not asking about a particular case that might come before the Court.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand why you can\'t simply confirm that he did what he said he was going to do during the campaign, which is appoint somebody who believes in a right to privacy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, I feel comfortable with -- as the President feels comfortable with her philosophy, I feel comfortable with my answer in having answered your question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be possible to get that stare decisis quote that you were talking about earlier?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe there was a stenographer in the meeting with --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, would you go back to them and -- I mean, if they were willing -- that sounds like it went further than what you\'re talking about -- than what you\'re giving us now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In what way?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were talking about stare decisis in the context of unenumerated rights; that\'s like big code for not overturning Roe v. Wade in the eyes of many.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to what I said.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, well, we\'ll switch topics then.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April, please.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t be associated with that, April.\xc2\xa0 That was Mark -- (laughter) -- that was not -- I was going to wait at least 10 minutes before I -- go ahead, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On torture photos, to bring up that topic again, there are reports that I believe began in the Daily Telegraph in Britain about General Taguba saying that there are photographs of rape not just at Abu Ghraib but at half a dozen U.S. detention facilities.\xc2\xa0 And there is some confusion right now as to whether those may be the photos that the President said he\'s not going to release.\xc2\xa0 Are they?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s confusion.\xc2\xa0 I think the Pentagon has been very clear in a statement saying that the story is not true.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will speak generally about some reports I\'ve witnessed over the past few years in the British media, and in some ways I\'m surprised it filtered down.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s just say if I wanted to look up -- if I wanted to read a write-up today of how Manchester United fared last night in the Champion\'s League Cup, I might open up a British newspaper.\xc2\xa0 If I was looking for something that bordered on truthful news, I\'m not entirely sure it would be the first stack of clips I picked up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that the report is completely false?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you very closely to the statement that DOD put out that the article is wrong and mischaracterizes the photos that are in question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just state that are no such photos in the photographs that the President has chosen not to disclose?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As the statement says, none of the photographs in question depict the images described in the article.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think if you do an even moderate Google search, you\'re not going to find many of these newspapers and truth within, say, 25 words of each other.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to pick up on what Chip was saying, what I think everyone is getting at is, the President, you\'re saying, is comfortable that she believes in a right to privacy and shares that view that he holds, and yet --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I said is comfortable with her interpretation and the way she interprets the Constitution.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I still think what people are wondering is why -- it strikes -- it comes across as a little bit of artifice, or people talking in code or talking around this issue.\xc2\xa0 And yet you\'re saying he\'s comfortable that she shares his views.\xc2\xa0 I guess, what would be wrong with him asking, hey, do you believe the Constitution encompasses the right to privacy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think, as Chip noted that -- my statement in saying that many past Presidents have not done that. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss some set of precedent in order to discuss the Supreme Court, but I\'m simply telling you what the President did in those meetings.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s a difference between asking somebody how they would rule on a case that might come before the Court and how one views whether there\'s a right to privacy -- that\'s a matter of judicial philosophy --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the President is comfortable with her judicial philosophy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How comfortable with it if he doesn\'t want to ask the point-blank question that would elicit her views?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he feels comfortable in being able to talk to her about her judicial philosophy, the way she interprets the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not burdened by the knowledge of being a constitutional law professor, but obviously they\'re having discussions and I feel comfortable relaying to you that he feels comfortable.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I try it a different way?\xc2\xa0 Is the President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all concerned that she could be part of a 5-4 majority overturning Roe v. Wade?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s in California or somewhere over the continental United States.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more time, and then I have to ask you a Germany question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) You mentioned settled law.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to get into settled answers in a minute.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the issue of settled law in the context of Roe versus Wade?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, I was -- not only was the stenographer not in this, I was not in that interview either.\xc2\xa0 So I have --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said back to back, they talked about unenumerated rights and the concept of settled law, which everyone understands to mean Roe v. Wade, the super precedent, and unenumerated rights referring to the right to privacy.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s why everyone is wondering if there was some talking around this issue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m simply conveying to you what was discussed. The President feels comfortable with her interpretations of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance you could go back to those lawyers and recreate what they were telling you about stare decisis and unenumerated rights?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will endeavor to see if they\'re likely to give me anything more, and I\'ll predict that the chances of that are somewhere between slim and none.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you doubt that she\'ll be asked on the Hill?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do I doubt she\'ll be -- I don\'t know what she\'ll be asked on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Obviously she -- we believe that when the Senate gets back next week -- I don\'t have specific information yet on her appointments, but I assume she\'ll start those visits sometime relatively early next week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Long-term interest rates spiked yesterday very dramatically.\xc2\xa0 The spread between short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates are now actually at a record.\xc2\xa0 And Treasury has a fairly significant auction next week on long-term loan bonds.\xc2\xa0 How worried right now is the administration and this White House that the pressure is now on you -- upon you to come up with a credible plan for bringing down the deficit, and the Fed no longer has the power simply to keep buying up these bonds?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, the President feels very comfortable with a budget that cuts the deficit in half in four years.\xc2\xa0 He feels very comfortable that we have a credible plan to finally get our fiscal house in order, and that we\'re going to take the steps necessary to do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of those big steps is grappling with the enormous and ever-rising cost of health care.\xc2\xa0 One of that is to lay the strong foundation for job growth.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that his economic plan to help the economy recover and spur economic growth, which you know will help our budget deficit and ultimately our debt, as well as the steps that are being taken to get our fiscal house in order, demonstrate the real concern that he has about our long-term fiscal standing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A Treasury official from the Bush years said that your plan amounts to, if we spend more on health care, we\'ll spend less on health care, and compare that to if we cut taxes, we\'ll get more tax revenue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, met with industry officials that pledged to cut $2 trillion from health care spending.\xc2\xa0 I think if you ask a governor, or a Medicare -- somebody that works on Medicare, or a Medicaid commissioner if reducing the rate of spending growth on health care will help budget deficits, I don\'t think it takes a calculator and a math degree to figure out that that will make significant progress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President feels very comfortable with the steps that the administration is taking to get our fiscal house in order and understands how important it is for our long-term growth.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, at least four of the ambassadorial nominees the President announced yesterday were big-money raisers for his campaign.\xc2\xa0 Is that changing the way Washington works when he makes appointments like that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I think you may know that the President was asked in the transition and said there will be some -- let me quote him -- "political appointees serving abroad.\xc2\xa0 It would be disingenuous for me to suggest that there are not going to be some excellent public servants, but who haven\'t come through the ranks of civil service."\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think yesterday we rolled out a number of both career and non-career ambassadorial appointments.\xc2\xa0 I think you see a group of committed individuals and proven professionals that are eager to serve their country.\xc2\xa0 Some of those individuals were fundraisers; some of those were career ambassadors; some of those were people that left either teaching or some other thing like that -- like Miguel Diaz to become our ambassadorial appointment to the Vatican, somebody who has a distinguished record -- or a Congressman like Tim Roemer, who has served on the 9/11 Commission and with some distinction in Congress, to be our ambassador to India.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President was exceedingly forthcoming in that in January.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, to follow up on the Cairo speech, I understand you said you don\'t want to get out in front of the speech, but could you speak generally about what President Obama hopes to accomplish?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, nothing more to add than what we were talking about when we announced it -- that the President, during the campaign, talked about and will give a speech about what he believes American outreach has to be to the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'ll have some time to get into what\'s in the speech, but the reason I don\'t want to get ahead of it is I want to make sure that the President is comfortable that he\'s had a chance to work on it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that\'s part of what they\'re doing on the plane right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 And second, does the administration have a sense as to whether China is ready to cut banking ties with North Korea, as the U.S. and Japan are pushing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that actions surrounding infrastructure at both banks and ports is part of discussions that are being had in the process of dealing with the reaction to North Korea\'s actions over the past few days.\xc2\xa0 The Chinese have been helpful in those discussions, but I don\'t want to get ahead of where the U.N. might be or where the individual government might be.\xc2\xa0 But I think they -- I would characterize overall their actions and their reaction to the events of the past few days as being very helpful.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration want China to go beyond words of condemnation, though?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s exactly what the countries are working on right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I just want to make sure I\'m not missing what might be an obvious step in this process, the conversation with Judge Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 I understand the President didn\'t ask her opinion or thoughts on Roe v. Wade, or the underlying abortion rights embedded in the privacy rights of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 Did she volunteer an opinion or an evaluation of her thoughts on that to the President without him asking?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what would be the source then of the comfort on this question?\xc2\xa0 If he didn\'t ask and she didn\'t volunteer, what\'s the source of the comfort?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The general -- as I said earlier, the general way in which she interprets the Constitution.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it has nothing to do with a conversation in particular about privacy rights?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how many different times I can say this\xc2\xa0 --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I just asked if she volunteered; you said no.\xc2\xa0 You said he hasn\'t asked.\xc2\xa0 So apparently, taking your words, there was not a specific conversation about privacy rights.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just asking --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said that three days ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what\'s then the source of the comfort level?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I repeated for about the eighth time in a very short of period of time, their general conversation about their philosophy, their approach to the Constitution, and her approach to judging.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple days ago you said you would check and see if her questionnaire -- the status of her questionnaire.\xc2\xa0 Do you have an update on it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe it is finished yet, but I will get something on that in the next hour for you, I promise.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, great.\xc2\xa0 Two quick policy things.\xc2\xa0 We had a conversation yesterday about closing Chrysler dealerships.\xc2\xa0 A gentleman named Leonard Bellavia, who has deposed Chrysler executives on behalf of some dealers, told Reuters, "It became clear to us that Chrysler does not see the wisdom of terminating 25 percent of its dealers.\xc2\xa0 It really wasn\'t Chrysler\'s decision. They\'re under enormous pressure from the President\'s automotive task force."</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Under enormous pressure?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To close dealerships that Chrysler itself, according to this man who has deposed Chrysler senior executives on behalf of dealers --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In the absence of seeing -- since we\'re talking about the law, I obviously haven\'t seen what affidavit he refers to.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s task force on autos did not pick individual dealerships.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\'t -- it isn\'t involved in picking what plants may or may not be closed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the job of the President\'s auto task force.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the job of the individual car company.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve got to figure out in their newly restructured world, based on the market, what their central supply chain is.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are the decisions that they made.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related to that, there is some concern in the blogosphere that -- of the Chrysler dealerships being closed -- a disproportionate number appear to be dealerships in which the operators contributed to Republicans, and hardly any in which contributions to Democrats have been closed down.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying the White House knows anything about this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking, would you be concerned about any taint of politics whatsoever in any of these decisions?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, Major, let me reiterate that we don\'t make those decisions, okay.\xc2\xa0 Chrysler makes those decisions.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m sure you can send Chrysler the address of the blog that you refer to.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether that report is accurate, but I can simply say that since my first answer was we\'re not involved in making those decisions, I would think your question would be appropriately dealt with by the company that is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House encouraged Congress to look at a value-added tax for health care reform?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I saw that article and that\'s not something that I understand is under discussion.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\'t encourage Congress to do that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, my role is not to encourage or discourage Congress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you know if anyone other than the President in the White House asked the Judge any questions relating to abortion or the right to privacy, or these issues?\xc2\xa0 And -- wait, I\'m not -- different question.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, good.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure this will change the whole answer.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and whether the reports that were generated -- we\'ve seen 30-, 60-, 70-page reports that were generated for the President on each of these nominees -- whether they came to any conclusions or made any recommendations about what they believe, based on their sort of investigation of her background, her position might be on these issues?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no reason to believe that if the President didn\'t ask, that others did.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know -- if they didn\'t ask, I\'m not sure how they could have put it in a report based on their not asking.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was an investigation done of her background.\xc2\xa0 They could ask other people, talk to people about what -- you know, sort of what her views are generally on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She does have more federal judiciary experience than any other nominee in the century.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am glad that after countless number of times of saying it, it seeped in.\xc2\xa0 I\'m hoping we have the same sort of luck with my previous answer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to North Korea, Robert, and the North Korean alert and the U.N. command going on alert.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in touch with the commanders in the Far East?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you gauge for us the level of concern about this, or does he think this is more of North Korea\'s typical rhetoric and bluster?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of -- I\'m not going to get into defense posture.\xc2\xa0 I think if the Defense Department wants to add to that, I would point you to them.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, the President obviously has been involved in and updated on these situations for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think as General Jones said yesterday, this is what the North Koreans said they were going to do, so we\'re not surprised that the North Koreans decided to do what they said they were going to do.\xc2\xa0 We obviously -- look, there\'s obvious -- obviously we have concern, but at the same time, we continue to believe that their actions are simply hurting themselves; that we\'ll take and do whatever is necessary, but I think that the North Koreans are obviously desirous of -- through bluster and threat -- international attention.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on ambassadorships.\xc2\xa0 Traditionally, the post in Paris and London do go to personal friends of the President, as opposed to career diplomats.\xc2\xa0 What are Mr. Rifkin\'s qualifications to be ambassador to France?\xc2\xa0 Does he speak French?
