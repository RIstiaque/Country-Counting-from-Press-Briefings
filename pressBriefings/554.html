Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:20 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Life is full of transitions, changes for everyone.\xc2\xa0 One happens tomorrow when Jamie Smith has her last day with us, and we are going to be extremely sad to see her go.\xc2\xa0 This is her last briefing with me because I\xe2\x80\x99ll be traveling tomorrow, so I wanted to thank Jamie here in the briefing for everything she\xe2\x80\x99s done for our operation behind that door and for you here in the press.\xc2\xa0 So thank you, Jamie.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Another transition, I want to congratulate Brianna Keilar on her promotion.</p>\n<p>But some things don\'t change, even as others do, so I\xe2\x80\x99d like to congratulate Ann Compton on her Lifetime Achievement Award.\xc2\xa0 That was remarkable.\xc2\xa0 Congratulations.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Indeed, really that\'s terrific and well deserved.</p>\n<p>I have no other announcements.\xc2\xa0 I certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t top those, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Josh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner in talking about immigration says that it will be hard to get anything through the House unless the President is able to regain some trust.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s pointing to things such as the liberties that the administration has taken in implementing the health care law.\xc2\xa0 If you take the Speaker at his word that this is a real obstacle for Republicans, then is there anything that the President can do to help restore that trust?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we remain optimistic about the prospects for comprehensive immigration reform in 2014.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen significant movement among Republicans on this issue, and it is heartening to see that Republican leaders in Congress -- including the Speaker of the House and others -- identify immigration reform as a necessary priority.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on issues encompassed within comprehensive immigration reform I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to look at what he\xe2\x80\x99s done already in helping build a bipartisan consensus, in helping build the most effective border enforcement that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.\xc2\xa0 Over the five years that he\xe2\x80\x99s been President, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen significant improvement in our border security.\xc2\xa0 CBP employs over 21,000 Border Patrol agents, keeping staffing levels at an all-time high.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve deployed proven, effective surveillance technology tailored to the operational requirements along the highest traffic areas, making progress toward a safer, stronger and more secure border.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s an issue that I think has been a particular concern to Republicans as well as Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the fact that the legislation in the Senate that the President supports further enhances border security.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on that, I think it speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But look, nothing like this -- nothing this important, nothing this comprehensive ever comes fast or easy in Washington, so this won\xe2\x80\x99t be any different.\xc2\xa0 But it remains an absolute fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made enormous progress in building that consensus, and that even the Republican Party, which had as its operative policy position not that long ago on this issue self-deportation, has come a significant way towards the middle, if you will, or towards the consensus that\xe2\x80\x99s now shared by businesses big and small, labor, law enforcement, religious communities, Republicans and Democrats across the country.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to see positive progress, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In spite of your optimism, the person who is running the chamber that\'s holding this up says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see the likelihood of this happening this year.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there comes a point or will come a point when the President -- like he did on climate change and other things -- will say if Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t act, I will, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll consider what could be done without Congress.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no alternative to comprehensive immigration reform passing through Congress.\xc2\xa0 It requires legislation.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made that clear in the past, and that continues to be his view.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we need to work together to build on the existing bipartisan consensus to see it help deliver a bill through the House and then a bill that can ultimately reach the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.</p>\n<p>I think that the challenges within the Republican Party on this issue are well known and they certainly don\'t have anything to do with the President.\xc2\xa0 But, as I noted before, the progress has been significant.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is a genuine recognition among leaders in the Republican Party that this is the right thing to do for our economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for our middle class.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for our businesses.\xc2\xa0 When we talk about expanding growth and opportunity, comprehensive immigration reform is very much a part of achieving that and achieving it together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'re just going to work steadily on this issue and we believe that it will get done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on raising the debt ceiling, it seems like even some of the things that Republicans would like to extract from you in exchange for raising the debt ceiling wouldn\'t be able to win enough support from Republicans who just don\'t want it raised at all -- the Speaker saying he probably couldn\'t even get 218 votes to canonize Mother Teresa.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering, considering that he\xe2\x80\x99s also saying we\'re not going to default, does this make you more optimistic that we\'ll be able to raise the debt ceiling without having a prolonged fight that could rattle the markets and create more uncertainty?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly believe Republican leaders who say that we have to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of Congress to ensure that bills that have already been incurred are paid in a timely fashion so that the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t default.\xc2\xa0 Our position, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is what it has been for a long time, which is that we are not going to pay ransom in return for Congress fulfilling this basic responsibility.</p>\n<p>So this is something that has to be worked out in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Lew has spoken about the timing on this and the need to move promptly, and we certainly hope and expect that that will happen.</p>\n<p>Yes, Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple of foreign policy questions for you.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States intervening in Ukraine in any way?\xc2\xa0 Arming protesters or otherwise doing anything to help in that conflict?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been playing a direct role in urging the government to refrain from violence and to sit down and work with the opposition.\xc2\xa0 You know, because it\'s been read out, that the Vice President has had a number of phone calls with President Yanukovych, and we\'re committed to working with both the government and the opposition to help deescalate this crisis so that the Ukrainian people themselves can decide their own future.</p>\n<p>We condemn violence by any party in Ukraine, and Russian officials should be doing the same.\xc2\xa0 Nonviolence has been the hallmark of the main protest in opposition leaders, and we support that.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that part of the discussion has to be an acceptance by the government that peaceful protest needs to be allowed and that that is a fundamental principle of participatory democracy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the answer is the assistance we\'ve provided has been consultation with both sides urging them to deescalate the crisis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Russian officials.\xc2\xa0 A Kremlin aide essentially accused Washington today of intervening, of arming the rebels.\xc2\xa0 Are there any -- my question is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The opposition movement has been peaceful, and they are peaceful protests.\xc2\xa0 That is the hallmark of this opposition.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know honestly what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about.\xc2\xa0 The assistance that we have provided has been through conversations that reflect our urging of both sides to\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 deescalate the crisis; urging the government directly to refrain from violence; urging discussion with the opposition so that a path forward can be decided upon that reflects the will of the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of a video that\xe2\x80\x99s been posted on YouTube that apparently it has a conversation between a State Department official and the U.S. ambassador talking about a future Ukraine government and using a fairly colorful expletive about the EU?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports about it.\xc2\xa0 I think the State Department obviously is aware of it.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss private diplomatic conversations.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly no secret that our ambassador and Assistant Secretary have been working with the government of Ukraine, with the opposition, with business and civil society leaders to support their efforts to find a peaceful solution through dialogue and political and economic reform.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Ukrainian people to decide their future.</p>\n<p>Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the call may be real?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that Assistant Secretary Nuland has been in contact with her EU counterparts, and relations with the EU are stronger than ever.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we are working -- Assistant Secretary Nuland, who has a lot of experience in this area, and our ambassador in Ukraine -- with the opposition and with the government to try to help deescalate the crisis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you that a phone call like this could be out there -- what\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be private conversation, very candid conversation, it appears, between diplomats?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about profanity --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about -- I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re speaking very -- I\xe2\x80\x99m actually not talking about the profanity.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re just talking about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, for instance, Victoria Nuland in the call appears to put her one opposition candidate over another, saying she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea that a certain --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on the content of private diplomatic conversations.\xc2\xa0 I would say that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not private anymore.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- what\xe2\x80\x99s your concern over that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- since the video was first noted and tweeted out by the Russian government, I think it says something about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s role.\xc2\xa0 But the content of the conversation is not something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to comment on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying Russia tapped this phone call?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just noting that they tweeted it out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it say about their role?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A private conversation now does appear to be public.<br/>\n\tIs that really the stance that a diplomat should be taking, in favoring one candidate over another?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss the conversation, Brianna.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the Assistant Secretary and our Ambassador and others have been working with the opposition, with the government, with business and civic leaders in Ukraine to help deescalate the crisis -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s best interest and in the best interest of the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Back to Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 Would you address specifically his complaint this morning that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lack of trust in the President?\xc2\xa0 The Speaker said that the President is running around the country telling people he\xe2\x80\x99s going to act on his own, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a phone and a pen.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s feeding the distrust because members of his caucus don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President would actually enforce or respect the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s already changed health care, some of the health care provisions, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the President would enforce security on the border.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Ann, what I can say on that last point is that the President has an exceptional record of improving border security.\xc2\xa0 On his watch, there are more CBP agents on the border now than ever consistently.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s his record.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to comprehensive immigration reform, it requires legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have worked with members of both parties, why we support bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate with significant majority -- legislation that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect word for word the way the President would have written the bill, but does reflect his principles, very much so -- and why we support efforts to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform in the House.\xc2\xa0 I think that, as I said earlier to Josh, these kinds of issues take time.\xc2\xa0 And this has certainly taken some time.\xc2\xa0 There was an effort under the previous President, Republican President George W. Bush to pass immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the Republicans should trust the President, and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone as far as he can go on deportations and border security -- that the rest has to be legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on border security has been well documented and has been testified to by Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can they trust the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on this issue bears that out.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, when it comes to executive actions versus legislation, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying from the beginning that this is a question of doing both.\xc2\xa0 And immigration reform is something that needs to be done through the legislature, through the Congress.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep working.\xc2\xa0 We believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s been significant progress.\xc2\xa0 We believe that -- and we note the significant movement that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republicans, especially in the House, on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we acknowledge that this has been historically a difficult issue for the Republican Party.</p>\n<p>But we are confident that Republican leaders and a lot of people who Republican officials listen to, strongly support immigration reform -- and that includes in business and law enforcement and faith communities.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get this done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be easy.\xc2\xa0 If it were easy, it would have been done already.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that 2014 presents the best opportunity we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had to get comprehensive immigration reform passed and signed into law.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 To follow on immigration, the CBO report this week -- this is totally separate from health care -- found that the labor force would be slowing after 2017, in part because of baby boomer retirements.\xc2\xa0 Are you using that, or can you use that as an argument for immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can you restate that?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I track.\xc2\xa0 But say it again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The labor force is going to be slowing after 2017, because of baby boomer retirements.\xc2\xa0 Is that a good case for immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that the economic growth that outside experts have said would come from passing immigration reform is a strong argument for immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And that economic growth would be spurred in a variety of ways if immigration reform were to pass.\xc2\xa0 And that may well be one of them.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to innovation and ensuring that some of the smartest young people in the world who study in our universities are able to stay here and start businesses, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly another way to have immigration reform spur further economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>So this is, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, something that has associated with it some pretty strong conservative talking points.\xc2\xa0 There is a strong conservative case to be made for passing comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that the consensus that\xe2\x80\x99s been built around it will ultimately lead to it passing and to him being able to sign it into law -- because, going back to some of these other questions, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about him.\xc2\xa0 We are fully confident that House Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to support immigration reform, because President Obama believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it, ultimately, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for our economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for the middle class, it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for security, and because they\'re hearing that from a lot of different quarters -- from business, from labor, from law enforcement, from religious leaders.\xc2\xa0 So that kind of consensus is not often achieved here, and I think that reflects why there\xe2\x80\x99s such a strong case for getting comprehensive immigration reform done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Obama administration scaling back its drone program in Pakistan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know I can\'t talk about operational matters.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the President made clear in his NDU speech that by the end of 2014, in the Afghan war theater, we will no longer have the same need for force protection and the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made against core al Qaeda will reduce the need for unmanned strikes.\xc2\xa0 Again, so that\'s something that the President spoke clearly about in his speech at NDU.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress against core al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We will also have either no troops or a significantly reduced number of troops in Afghanistan after 2014, and that obviously lessens the force protection needs that we have.\xc2\xa0 So I think those factors play into what the President said about a reduced need for unmanned strikes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DNI Clapper said last week that al Qaeda is getting better at evading U.S. detection.\xc2\xa0 Does that also play into the decision?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\'t see that particular point that the DNI said, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- had stepped up its measures to evade U.S. detection, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem on its face to be all that unusual.\xc2\xa0 But does that play into the decision --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- again, since I didn\'t see that testimony, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the context, if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about core al Qaeda or other affiliates and movements elsewhere in the region.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case that we are constantly assessing al Qaeda and core al Qaeda, as well as its affiliates, and we continue the fight against al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to core al Qaeda in the AfPak region, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress against them, and because of that we will -- and because of, as I mentioned, the reduced need for force protection, the President said we would be able to reduce our need for unmanned strikes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one quick one on Ukraine, and then another topic. Given all the revelations about U.S. surveillance and the back-and-forth with Germany and others, haven\xe2\x80\x99t there been steps taken to make sure that senior U.S. diplomats are speaking on phones that are secure?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I just don\'t have anything more for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department for more on that issue, that story.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On health care, a lot of stories today, Wall Street Journal, L.A. Times, about doctor choices being limited for folks, and also saying that the federal government is trying to push back and that regulators are taking a look at this, seeing whether insurance regulators are going too far with limiting choices on doctors.\xc2\xa0 Insurers say they need to do this to keep costs down.\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you that while the website may be getting better, while the enrollments are going up, that once folks do enroll, they may have a problem keeping their doctor?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are many ways that the Affordable Care Act helps keep costs down, Ed, and including requiring insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on care instead of overhead, requiring insurers to justify rate increases of 10 percent or more, and providing incentives for providers to deliver smarter care resulting in better outcomes and lower costs for consumers.</p>\n<p>We have put protections in place to ensure that consumers have a choice of providers through standards for networks of providers.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that\'s new.\xc2\xa0 Consumer protections and federal and state law require health plans to include a sufficient choice of providers, as well as essential community providers.\xc2\xa0 And the ACA allows individuals to appeal their insurance company\xe2\x80\x99s decisions about what is or is not covered.</p>\n<p>And for 2015, HHS plans to have even more aggressive efforts in place to ensure that consumers have good networks of doctors, community providers and specialists.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a number of protections in place now, and in 2015, HHS will be launching even more aggressive efforts to ensure that consumers have good networks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The chief of AOL, Tim Armstrong, did some interviews today with various TV networks because their earnings are out.\xc2\xa0 And he claimed that one cost for him right now is it\xe2\x80\x99s costing $7 million to implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care law.\xc2\xa0 And he claims he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make a change to 401(k) benefits to pay for that in part.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that some companies may be making decisions like that?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s on the record saying that.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know how many others may, saying, look, you may get better health benefits, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to cut your 401(k) benefits?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t speak to any individual company\xe2\x80\x99s decisions or the reasons for or rationales expressed for the decisions they make.\xc2\xa0 What has been the case for a long time is that employers have been making changes to health care benefits or eliminating health insurance entirely.\xc2\xa0 That is a trend that has gone on for some time, long predating the ACA.\xc2\xa0 And there are certainly changes that have been made, as all of you in the private sector know, to other benefit programs, including 4019(k)s, long predating the ACA.</p>\n<p>What I would say is that every major business in America that provides health insurance to its employees benefits enormously from the historic reduced increase in growth rates and cost rates that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in health care.\xc2\xa0 That company -- any company that was projecting what their health care costs were going to be five years ago were basing those projections on estimates of health care costs inflation that turned out to be much higher than reality, resulting in significant savings.\xc2\xa0 And that is tied in part -- in significant part, in our view -- to the Affordable Care Act becoming a reality.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned about a shift where they may say, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do a better job with health care, but --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Every company -- and this has been the case for a lot longer than the ACA has been around -- has been making decisions like that.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is that when it comes to the planning that companies make -- the plans that companies make with regards to their health care costs, those decisions are made easier by the fact that health care costs have been growing at the slowest pace in 50 years, since the Affordable Care Act was passed into law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCritics proclaimed with great assurance that the opposite would happen.\xc2\xa0 It turns out they were wrong.\xc2\xa0 Some of those same critics proclaimed that the Clinton budget, when it passed, would lead to recession.\xc2\xa0 We saw the longest period of economic growth in modern history.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, the critics are wrong.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you, Jay, if I can about the terror threat that says that terrorists may be trying to smuggle explosives through toothpaste tubes and other similar containers into Russia right now.\xc2\xa0 The Former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Morell, said this morning, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not overly concerned about this particular threat.\xe2\x80\x9d Is this administration concerned about this threat?\xc2\xa0 Or more importantly, should Americans be concerned about this threat?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that out of an abundance of caution, DHS routinely shares relevant information with its domestic and international partners, including those associated with international events such as the Sochi Olympics.\xc2\xa0 And this is an example of that regular communication.\xc2\xa0 DHS has provided more detail, and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DHS for more detail.</p>\n<p>Now, as we have said, if we should receive information in the coming days and weeks that changes our assessment of whether people should travel to Sochi, we will make that information public through the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s usual channels.\xc2\xa0 The travel alert that the State Department put out earlier in the year in January remains in effect, and it does not advise Americans not to go to Sochi; it advises precautions that those who do go to Sochi should take, including registering with the State Department so that they can get quick information should they need it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With regard to this particular notice that went out, I would note that over the years -- certainly since 9/11 -- there have been many threats to aviation that have resulted in us sharing information with airlines.\xc2\xa0 And our job has always been to provide information to our partners so that, collaboratively, we can best mitigate the threat.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing so again in this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question then -- for a lot of Americans, there were some -- not mixed messages from you guys perhaps, but the way this way reported out, there was what appeared to be perhaps not an imminent threat, but real concern.\xc2\xa0 And then, this morning there were some reporting that there was not as much concern.\xc2\xa0 So I guess, what is the threshold for you guys to communicate threats of this sort?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, for that discussion, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d have to refer you to DHS and TSA, because they evaluate the information, as does our intelligence community, and decide whether it crosses the threshold.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be some concern if it\xe2\x80\x99s communicated out.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 And we have noted that -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s broadly speaking -- that we have noted there\xe2\x80\x99s been an uptick in the threat reporting in the run-up to the Sochi Games.\xc2\xa0 And that is of concern.\xc2\xa0 It is also something that you would expect, and we did expect, in this case.\xc2\xa0 In this kind of event, it\'s not unusual.\xc2\xa0 But our intelligence community is quite focused on Sochi.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to comment on each reported threat; we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take them all seriously and monitor them.\xc2\xa0 And, again, if there\xe2\x80\x99s information that the IC receives that changes our assessment about whether or not Americans ought to travel to Sochi, we would certainly make that information available and change our public statements on it to that effect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And you know, I think, because we read it out, that the President convened a meeting earlier this week in the White House Situation Room to receive an update from his team on the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to support security for the Olympic Games.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that obviously has the attention of and focus of the intelligence community and other elements of our national security apparatus, and obviously the attention of the President.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep monitoring it and provide information if necessary, if it changes our view about the security situation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meetings at Nats Park with Senate Democrats -- I think as one of the my colleagues referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cField of Dems,\xe2\x80\x9d which I found to be memorable -- a Democrat who was there said that the President basically talked a little bit about his standing in some states and to that effect. So does the President concede that his appearance in some states where he is unpopular would do more harm than good?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to assist Democrats in every way that he can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he do more harm than good in some states?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the decisions about how different candidates campaign and what they would like in terms of assistance is something you can ask those individual candidates about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that, at least?\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think there are places --<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President is just going to do what he can to assist Democrats.\xc2\xa0 I think he has and he will.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the environment this year is qualitatively different than it\xe2\x80\x99s been most of the years I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Washington when it comes to election cycles.\xc2\xa0 So the President is taking an approach that he believes will be of assistance to Democrats, because he and the Democrats he supports share the same priorities when it comes to expanding opportunity and taking action that rewards hard work and responsibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly, on a lighter note, the President was the first-ever sitting President to sit on Jay Leno\xe2\x80\x99s couch on the \xe2\x80\x9cTonight Show.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 After a decades-long run of the \xe2\x80\x9cTonight Show,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving.\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any conversations with Jay Leno?\xc2\xa0 Is he a fan of Jay Leno?\xc2\xa0 What does he have to say about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is a fan and he has enjoyed his times on the set with Jay Leno.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s just the end of an era I think for a lot of folks who have watched him on the \xe2\x80\x9cTonight Show\xe2\x80\x9d over all these years.\xc2\xa0 So the President wishes him well.\xc2\xa0 We all do.\xc2\xa0 And like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed being with the President in the times he has been out there.\xc2\xa0 And I know he has enjoyed the experience.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will the President stick to his absolutist position on no concessions for the debt limit raise, even if enough members of the Republican caucus can cause trouble and demand something for doing so?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, all I would say is our position, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same as it was in the fall, and that is that he is not going to pay ransom on behalf of the American people so that Congress does its job.\xc2\xa0 This is a core responsibility that Congress has.\xc2\xa0 You charge some things on a credit card, on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s card, you have an obligation to pay the bill when it comes.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s all this is.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what raising the debt ceiling is about.</p>\n<p>So he expects that Congress will fulfill its responsibility. Republican leaders have said again and again that they will do that; that will ensure that the United States pays its bills and that the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t default.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re hopeful that that will take place in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not all the members are apparently not on board yet.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting about that.\xc2\xa0 You guys would know better than I about the different discussions.\xc2\xa0 I can just say that we\'re over here making very clear what our position is, what the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is, which is that this is something Congress needs to do.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hearing that Republican leaders are saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get done and should get done because we can\'t threaten the American economy or the global economy in order to try to extract ransom on some issue or the other.</p>\n<p>So that\'s been our position and it\xe2\x80\x99s not changing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even if it comes to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What?\xc2\xa0 It comes to what?\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s views are clear.\xc2\xa0 The Republican leaders have said they won\'t let the country default, that they understand it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of Congress to ensure that our bills are paid.\xc2\xa0 So our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed and we expect Congress to act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He won\'t negotiate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pay ransom.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, does the President -- how does the President interpret the fact that none of the things that the Republicans are talking about even theoretically attaching to the debt limit have had anything to do with spending or the deficit or the debt?\xc2\xa0 That\'s kind of a change from years past when Boehner always had insisted on dollar for dollar.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting about those discussions, so I\'m not going to characterize that reporting.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll simply say what our position is, which is we\'re not going to pay ransom.\xc2\xa0 The American people should not have to, and the President insists they will not pay ransom to Congress or to House Republicans in order for Congress to fulfill its basic responsibility.\xc2\xa0 That position won\'t change.</p>\n<p>Last year they shut the government down in an effort to do what, by shutting the government down and by trying to hold the economy hostage, they couldn\'t do through legislation or through the election or through the Supreme Court when it came to the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So I think that ended badly -- certainly for the Republican Party, but much more importantly, for the economy and the American people.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re hopeful that that is not a path Republicans want to travel again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last year, you guys agreed to something for the debt limit -- there was a \xe2\x80\x9cno budget, no pay\xe2\x80\x9d provision basically requiring the Senate actually to pass a budget resolution, take a lot of difficult votes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily a ransom or you weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually paying something; the Senate Democrats were going to do something.\xc2\xa0 Is that kind of procedural kind of sidecar something that could resolve the differences here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, our position is the same as it was last time, the same as it was last fall:\xc2\xa0 No ransom.\xc2\xa0 How leaders on Capitol Hill figure out the way forward is up to them, but we\'re not going to pay a ransom in order for Congress to do its job.</p>\n<p>Leslie, and then Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President meets later today with the President of Haiti.\xc2\xa0 One of the concerns -- and I\'m wondering how concerned the United States is that the country hasn\xe2\x80\x99t held elections yet.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if that will be addressed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that the President looks forward to welcoming President Martelly of Haiti to the White House this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the United States has stood with Haiti throughout its recovery from the devastating earthquake of 2010. But our relationship with Haiti is broader and deeper than short- term reconstruction alone.\xc2\xa0 Together with Haiti we are working to create the conditions for sustainable, long-term development, stability, growth and prosperity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe note that nearly all earthquake rubble has been cleared away.\xc2\xa0 More than 90 percent of Haitians have transitioned out of camps and into housing.\xc2\xa0 HIV-AIDS is on the decline.\xc2\xa0 Cholera is down 83 percent from 2011, and the rate of fatality is below 1 percent.\xc2\xa0 Crime is down.\xc2\xa0 GDP growth is on the rise.\xc2\xa0 Reliable access to electricity is up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to elections, we want to see elections that are free, fair and transparent, that allow Haitians to express their views as part of the political process and that provide the political stability that is critical for Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s continued progress.</p>\n<p>We know that building a vibrant democracy is not easy and it does not take place overnight.\xc2\xa0 The United States has been at it for 237 years, and we continue to work at it every day.\xc2\xa0 But we do see great hope and great potential in Haiti, and we will continue to work closely together to build the brighter, more prosperous future that the Haitian people deserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect a readout after the meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see.\xc2\xa0 I expect some sort of readout.</p>\n<p>Yes, Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Boehner had his newser this morning on immigration and talked about rallying his own troops, but he also added this -- he said the President is going to have to provide some votes.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On which issue?\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Immigration.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Provide some votes?\xc2\xa0 I think that the Democratic Party is strongly in support of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that it would disagree with Speaker Boehner that he can expect Democratic support for comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on immigration -- the Speaker last week seemed to put out signals that they really -- the leadership, at least, wanted to pursue some sort of immigration reform, and today comes out and says some remarks that seemed to throw cold water on that -- at least that\'s some of the interpretation.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see this as a strategy by the Speaker to move this really contentious issue in a delicate way forward, and that that\xe2\x80\x99s an effective strategy so far?\xc2\xa0 Or do you read it as they\xe2\x80\x99re not sure what they want to do and this is a bit reactionary depending on which way the wind is blowing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just focused on working with Congress to try to move this forward and doing that in a way that reflects the principles the President laid out, reflects the principles embodied in the Senate bill, and reflects the views not just of the President or the Democratic Party, but of this broad and deep consensus across the country.</p>\n<p>So we know that this is a difficult issue for the Republican Party, and we note the substantial progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in terms of views about it among the leadership and the rank and file.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with the House, and look forward to progress on this issue, and ultimately, as I said earlier, to legislation passing that the President can sign.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take more than a year -- and House Republicans made that clear -- would the President consider, even as an interim measure, some kind of executive action slowing or stopping deportation?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has addressed this many times, and I have, too.\xc2\xa0 This is -- you need a permanent solution to these problems, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what comprehensive immigration reform represents.\xc2\xa0 He has to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 We operate under prosecutorial discretion and enforcement discretion so that the focus is on criminals.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the broader issues that need to be resolved here, that has to happen through legislation.\xc2\xa0 That has to happen through comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the hypotheticals that you lay out, Christi, are not ones that we are here to accept.\xc2\xa0 We believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s been significant progress and that this is an opportunity for the consensus that\xe2\x80\x99s built out in the country as well as here in Washington to push this thing over the finish line.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy.\xc2\xa0 Nothing comes easy in Washington -- nothing except possibly the naming of a post office.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not under any illusion that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard work by our friends in the House or by any stakeholder.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for the economy, the right thing to do for the middle class, the right thing to do for our security, the right thing to do for our businesses, the right thing to do for innovation.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, because of that, we believe this will get done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow up, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Europe and to Saudi Arabia, was any consideration given to going to Israel and to Palestine to try to butt heads together on that issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have readouts of our travel discussions.\xc2\xa0 You know the travel that we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Secretary Kerry has been very engaged on that issue, and we continue to work hard to help move the Middle East peace process forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President made reference to anti-Semitism.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to bring up the issue with President Hollande?\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s growing anti-Semitism in France.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview of his meeting with President Hollande.\xc2\xa0 As the President noted this morning, anti-Semitism is an issue that we are always concerned about and vigilant about.\xc2\xa0 In terms of this specific conversation, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, real quick -- I know you addressed this earlier in the briefing, but I think I misheard you.\xc2\xa0 Did you say that there are now more border agents in place than ever before?\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch the phrase.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To be precise, CBP employs over 21,000 border patrol agents, keeping staffing levels at an all-time high.\xc2\xa0 So I read \xe2\x80\x9call-time high\xe2\x80\x9d as all-time.\xc2\xa0 And they have deployed proven, effective surveillance technology tailored to the operational requirements along the highest traffic areas.\xc2\xa0 So not only are they putting boots on the ground, but they\xe2\x80\x99re using technology to make the effort more effective and efficient.\xc2\xa0 The combination of manpower and improvements in technology makes our border even more secure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Friday, White House counselor John Podesta told Bloomberg News that the executive order that would prohibit federal contractors from LGBT workplace discrimination was under consideration and being looked at by the White House.\xc2\xa0 Now, that same day, you called that executive order hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reevaluation taking place on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that what we said is we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on that issue.\xc2\xa0 We are pushing Congress to move forward on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\xc2\xa0 We look at and consider a lot of things.\xc2\xa0 Our focus is on getting Congress to pass something that is comprehensive, that represents the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that we need to extend equal rights to the LGBT community.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Congress to move that issue forward.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that hypothetical EO.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we strongly support action by the House, in keeping with what the Senate did, to get the Employment Non-Discrimination Act passed into law.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the data on this issue -- and specifically on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- I think it is overwhelmingly demonstrated that this has the support of the American people across the country.</p>\n<p>And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said again and again, this is -- history is moving on this issue in the right direction, and opposing these kinds of things means finding yourself on the wrong side of history.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, ultimately, that any member of Congress wants to be on the wrong side of history.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll see progress.\xc2\xa0 Nobody thought -- or at least a lot of people didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we would see this move through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It did.\xc2\xa0 And we remain hopeful that it will move through the House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the strategy is for comprehensive federal legislation, why do an EO for the minimum wage for federal contractors?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I take your point, Justin.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that our position on this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on other potential or hypothetical EOs.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re supporting legislation when it comes to ENDA.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to press hard for Congress to take action on the minimum wage, because that\xe2\x80\x99s that right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 The President has made that clear again and again.</p>\n<p>So, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that Americans\xe2\x80\x99 views on these issues have become increasingly clear and to oppose legislation that enshrines equal rights is to oppose the tide of history.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope that in the end, members of Congress, members of the House don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be on the wrong side of that.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:06 P.M.
