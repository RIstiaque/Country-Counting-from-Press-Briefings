EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see you all this morning.\xc2\xa0 Our itinerary today includes a stop in Prince George County, Virginia, where the President will tour the Rolls-Royce Crosspointe plant, which engineers and manufactures aircraft parts.\xc2\xa0 From there we\'ll head to the Bayou City -- Houston, Texas, where the President has a couple of campaign events before returning back to Washington late tonight.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have a couple of announcements before we get started, and then I\'ll take your questions should you have any.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is, en route this morning, the President is placing a telephone call to President-elect Putin.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a preview of that call, but we will put together a readout of that call on paper that will circulate at some point later this morning.\xc2\xa0 So stay tuned for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s this leg?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s this leg.\xc2\xa0 Technology willing, it\'s probably occurring right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing, I wanted to give you a preview of is the official visit by Prime Minister Cameron and his wife Samantha to the White House next week.\xc2\xa0 As you\'ve seen from news reports, the President and Prime Minister Cameron will be flying to Dayton, Ohio, on Tuesday to attend an NCAA Tournament men\'s basketball game.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe First Lady and Mrs. Cameron will remain in Washington, D.C. and participate in an Olympic-themed event with Washington, D.C. area children on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, you\'ll see the more formal activities that are typically associated with an official visit.\xc2\xa0 This will include extensive meetings about the special and the essential relationships between the United States and the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a strong working relationship and actually even a strong personal bond between Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama they\'ll cultivate during this visit and during these meetings, in which they\'ll discuss a wide range of issues that are on the agenda -- everything ranging from Afghanistan, where our troops are serving shoulder to shoulder, to confronting Iran and Syria, democratic movements in the Middle East and North Africa, and they\'ll of course, discuss the upcoming G8 and NATO summits.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I mentioned before, we maintain a special and a essential friendship and partnership with the government and people of the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 The United Kingdom is our NATO ally and our closest partner in the world.\xc2\xa0 Next week\'s visit by the Prime Minister reciprocates President Obama\'s state visit to the UK in May of last year that was hosted by Her Majesty the Queen.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then the last thing, at this morning\'s event in Prince George County, the President will tour, as I mentioned, the Rolls-Royce Crosspointe plant, which engineers and manufactures aircraft engine components.\xc2\xa0 It is an example of two important things:\xc2\xa0 Companies are choosing to invest in and create jobs right here in America; and second, it\'s an example of the kind of advanced manufacturing that the President believes can be and should be a critical part of the American economy.\xc2\xa0 These are good-paying jobs and yield products that the world relies on, and they\'re stamped with the words:\xc2\xa0 Made in America.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'ve also seen the President, from news reports, will talk about a proposal to create advanced manufacturing hubs that will foster a synergy between academia, government, and businesses large and small, to take good ideas from the lab and move them quickly to the production line and eventually to market.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that these hubs -- the President believes that we should establish 15 of these hubs.\xc2\xa0 This is a proposal that was included in his FY13 budget that was submitted to Congress, and we urge Congress to act on that proposal quickly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Congress to act, so the President will also announce today a competitive application for a pilot program that will get going sooner, using existing, already-appropriated funds from a couple of different federal agencies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, why go to a foreign-owned company to make this announcement today?\xc2\xa0 Why not a U.S. company?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, Kate, there are companies both foreign and domestic that are interested in investing in America and creating jobs right here in America.\xc2\xa0 This plant also underscores the important role that advanced manufacturing can and should play in the future of the American economy and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any foreign-owned companies that will benefit from these manufacturing hubs or this competitive grant, or is it just U.S. companies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The goal of the manufacturing hubs is to bring businesses large and small together with academia and government\xc2\xa0 -- both state, local as well as the federal government -- to foster a synergy to bring goods and ideas from the lab more quickly to the production line.\xc2\xa0 So the idea is that this would benefit a broader segment of the economy and not just one specific company.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, could you respond to a reported series of defections from Syria, both government officials and military generals?\xc2\xa0 The administration said before that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if this current situation has changed the number or the overall prospective of how stable the regime is.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports of some defections.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm those reports right now.\xc2\xa0 But those defections are a courageous step by members of the regime demonstrating their loyalty to and support for the Syrian people and their aspirations.\xc2\xa0 This is -- if the reports are true, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a sign that there are significant cracks in the Assad regime and they do lend some evidence to something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said for some time now, which is that Assad -- that a democratic transition will take place in Syria -- I should say a political transition will take place in Syria that will end with Assad no longer in power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese defections, like I said, if they are true, are an indication of something that the United States and the international community have said many times and continue to believe is true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The head of the opposition, though, seems to indicate that Kofi Annan getting involved wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really help the situation.\xc2\xa0 Does that throw any cold water on this plan for a political situation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Ken, we\xe2\x80\x99re very interested in working with the "Friends of Syria" and the international community to support the Syrian people and their aspirations.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the role of the international community here is important in demonstrating to the Assad regime that they should stop their violence against innocent civilians and respect the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal of those efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Mr. McDonnell going to greet the President in Virginia, and is Governor Perry going to be in Texas?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I understand that Governor McDonnell will greet President Obama when we land in Richmond and also travel with the President to the events today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also be greeted by the Mayor of Richmond and Congressman Bobby Scott when we arrive in Richmond.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Governor Perry, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his schedule is today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to the change in leadership the Pakistan intelligence agency announced today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about some of the steps the White House is taking in advance of the hearing on the health care case, rallying support around it, as reported today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw the report in The New York Times today that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 The administration has been involved for more than two years now in an effort to educate the American public about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 We remain confident that the Supreme Court will rule that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing many of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 There are 2.5 million young adults who are on their parent\xe2\x80\x99s insurance today.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen more than 3 million seniors save $600 last year on their prescription drug costs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to see these kinds of benefits kick in as the Affordable Care Act is implemented.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the focus of our efforts are on -- is educating the public about the benefits of the program, but also making sure that the Affordable Care Act is implemented properly and effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, three years ago today the DOW Jones Industrial Average hit its financial crisis low.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s doubled since then in value.\xc2\xa0 Do you see that as a positive economic indicator?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that?\xc2\xa0 When you talk to people suffering, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s something people have not been talking too much about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Laura, we don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on the ups and downs on the stock market specifically.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter, I would say that the statistic you\xe2\x80\x99re citing seems to undercut the criticism from some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s political opponents who have raised significant questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the economy in some ways.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of many statistics that would lend some perspective on how far this economy has come and the role that the President has had to play in that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have new jobs numbers this morning.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your message for those people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet feeling any of this -- the jobs, the stock market?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We did see a solid jobs report today, and that is an encouraging sign about the economy.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we don\xe2\x80\x99t get too excited about one month\xe2\x80\x99s jobs numbers beating expectations, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t get too disappointed if there\'s one month of jobs numbers that fails to meet expectations.\xc2\xa0 What we are examining, however, are the longer trends that are at work here.\xc2\xa0 And today\xe2\x80\x99s jobs numbers are a continuation of a trend that is encouraging.\xc2\xa0 Over the last six months we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 1.3 million private sector jobs created.\xc2\xa0 That is a positive trend.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as you know, Michael, we\xe2\x80\x99re digging out of a very deep hole.\xc2\xa0 This is something the President talks about a lot.\xc2\xa0 And so this isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work that remains to be done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons the President is talking today about his proposal to create manufacturing -- these advanced manufacturing hubs, because there is an important role for advanced manufacturing to play in strengthening our economy over the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a range of other proposals that the President offered -- last fall, the American Jobs Act, that Congress has not yet acted on.\xc2\xa0 And so we want Congress to do more to strengthen our economy, create jobs, and support the private sector as they lead our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, why did it take the President a couple of days to call Putin to congratulate him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that there -- that it took him a little while to -- that it took a little while to schedule the call.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any of the details on that. Like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout of the call shortly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you call the call congratulatory, or did you just say he called him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I just said he called him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President said he was going to put forward another framework on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you expect to happen before the election this year?\xc2\xa0 And will it be different in any way from what came out in 2010?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have an update for you in terms of our legislative agenda as it relates to efforts to pass immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has been a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s since he first took office, and it continues to be.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been disappointed that some Republicans who have previously articulated their support for immigration reform have backed away from that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat has been a source of -- you heard the President talk about that at the news conference actually, this idea that at one point Republicans believed it was something that Democrats and Republicans should work together on.\xc2\xa0 But now we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing a different tune from not just Republicans in Congress but some of the Republican candidates, in fact, too.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President finds pretty disappointing.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow that we\xe2\x80\x99re on the ground we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and keep you updated over the course of the day, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to expedite the Putin readout as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:36 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
