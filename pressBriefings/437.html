PDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to begin with an observation about an occurrence happening roughly 2,500 hundred miles away back in Washington.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Veterans\xe2\x80\x99 Affairs Committee voted 14-0 to approve Bob McDonald to be the next Secretary of the Veterans Administration.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t often get to observe bipartisan, unanimous votes out of the Senate, even at the committee level.\xc2\xa0 But we believe this support underscores Bob McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s unique qualifications for this role and will help him, once confirmed, to take on the issues facing the VA to improve veterans\xe2\x80\x99 access to care and strengthen accountability at the agency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Eric, what information does the White House have in the latest of whether or not the missile belonged to the rebels?\xc2\xa0 Reuters has a report out today saying that there are some rebels who are confirming that they have the Buk missiles.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what kind of intelligence the White House is seeing?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 I think the intelligence community is in the process of putting out their presentation of the evidence -- they did so yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to realize that while we work to determine who is responsible for literally firing this missile, the picture emerging is not in doubt.\xc2\xa0 We assessed that it was an SA-11 and that it came from a separatist-controlled area.\xc2\xa0 And we know Russia has provided arming and training for these separatists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In other words, the question of who specifically fired the missile is for the investigation to determine so that the victims\xe2\x80\x99 families can gain closure.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know that yet does not absolve Russia of its responsibility for creating an environment in which militants were trained, given weapons, and encouraged to fight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the U.S. be releasing more evidence about this in the days to come and do you have a timeline for that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I may be the Principal Deputy Press Secretary, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not part of the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let them talk about their process for that.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to be as forthcoming as possible in explaining and laying out what we have to date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports that there are additional sanctions on Russia being considered.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on that for us?\xc2\xa0 Dow Jones is reporting that.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that yesterday the Europeans took actions to prepare additional sanctions against Russia.\xc2\xa0 As far as the United States is concerned, I would tell you that clearly we\xe2\x80\x99ve already put in place a sanctions regime that has had a debilitating impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re assessing all the sort of tools in our arsenal as we move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any sense on the -- when the timeline for additional U.S. sanctions on Russia could happen?\xc2\xa0 Any sense on timing for that?<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No, again, this is something we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly reviewing and assessing so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the FAA restricting flights into Israel, do you guys have any comment on that?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support that decision by the FAA?\xc2\xa0 Is it productive for talks going on there?<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Lisa, I appreciate the way you phrase the question since this is a decision within the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory authority, and it\xe2\x80\x99s strictly security related.\xc2\xa0 The FAA makes its determinations on whether to issue or rescind its various notices, free from any political interference.\xc2\xa0 So as you know, the FAA continually evaluates the hazard and threats to determine when U.S. carriers can operate safely, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll let them make that determination.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, on the border.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker today sent the President a letter indicating some frustration over lack of guidance from the White House on what the White House wants in terms of changes to the 2008 law.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could be as clear as possible as to what it is that you guys want Congress to do.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said you want Congress to do something -- can you specify what that is?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I can be crystal clear.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the letter we sent a few weeks ago on this very issue.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the Speaker is referring to, especially since the letter we sent seeking additional authority for the Department of Homeland Security Secretary, was outlined in that letter and has been reiterated by my colleague, the Press Secretary Josh Earnest several times since.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We want to work with Democrats and Republicans to make sure those changes are done the right way.\xc2\xa0 But first and foremost, we need the resources -- in the form of judges, prosecutors, asylum officers -- to deal with the problems.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans are as serious and sincere about solving the problem as they claim to be, we\xe2\x80\x99re counting on them to act quickly and be part of the solution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, the President is talking a lot about the economy on this trip and -- to donors -- and again tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you feel like some of the world crises are drowning -- is having an effect on that message, whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for the President to get the economic message across.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Kathleen.\xc2\xa0 We are not the first administration and we won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last to deal with multiple priorities and challenges, both domestically and internationally.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take away from the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief domestic policy priority, which is creating opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why on Monday, the President signed an executive order protecting LGBT workers from discrimination, and on Monday he also outlined significant new private sector commitments to help expand opportunity for young men of color.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, not even 24 hours ago -- even though it feels like a month -- the President and Vice President announced new efforts to make sure our federal training programs are delivering the skills workers need for good jobs.\xc2\xa0 So I do stipulate there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on right now, but even as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak over the last few days, he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on creating jobs and expanding middle-class opportunity.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more about that tomorrow, as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can you speak to the decision to keep the information about the super PAC events the President has done so limited?\xc2\xa0 I know that the events are run by the House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC and it\xe2\x80\x99s their call, but there is information that you guys could release -- even about the attendance, how many people are there, who they are, how much money they\xe2\x80\x99re paying to be there.\xc2\xa0 And was there an effort made to get the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks open at all to the press?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, Isaac, especially since, as you point out, these events are built by the outside groups.\xc2\xa0 Given your question is about transparency, I would only ask that you judge us by the record -- by our record and that of our predecessors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve done more to achieve the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency than any other previous administration -- that includes, by the way, opening up fundraising events at private homes to the print pool, people like yourself.\xc2\xa0 So we feel good that you were able to cover events today and yesterday on this trip.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a change that we implemented to give reporters more access than they\xe2\x80\x99ve had before, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a change we feel good about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not provide more information about simple things about the events like the cost to get in -- that was a question about the Senate Majority PAC event last night.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those outside groups.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more on this.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Jim.\xc2\xa0 The President was reluctant to do events like the ones that he has done at these super PACs, even during his reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the decision of why it\xe2\x80\x99s okay now to do those events when two years ago that was not what he was doing?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Isaac, I very much appreciate that question because usually I field questions that we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing enough to help Democrats.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But as you know, the President has long advocated for campaign finance reform and expressed his opposition to the Citizens United ruling, which opened the floodgates for special interests.\xc2\xa0 We supported the DISCLOSE Act, ultimately blocked by Republicans, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also said we\xe2\x80\x99d support a constitutional amendment.</p>\n<p>But in terms of the events on these trips like the ones you\xe2\x80\x99re mentioning, I think as you and many others have reported, the President is committed to helping Democrats do well in these midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined the case of why we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the country that Democratic candidates and this President want to grow the economy by helping expand the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The other side wants to help the few at the top and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s not a sound vision for a viable, growing economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it undercuts the principles that you outlined that the President has for him to be doing these events now when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing them two years ago?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies positions are clear.\xc2\xa0 He has tried to do a lot on this, some unilaterally, but when Republicans block measures in Congress, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re going to allow the midterms to happen on an uneven playing field.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems, Eric, that the President, one of his objections to the super PACs to begin with was their secretive nature, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t he just fostering that by participating in them and not providing any sunshine into them?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the outside groups for the policies that they\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted for how they disclose information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we go back to Ukraine and --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- whether there is -- the intel community said yesterday that there was suggestions that the Russians are still continuing to help the rebels, the separatists.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House looking at any sort of means of finding a way to dissuade them from doing that?\xc2\xa0 Any other, like, arms embargoes or anything like that as the Europeans have looked at?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We continue to be concerned by the Russian support for the separatists.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a number of steps.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I think President Putin feels increasingly isolated.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I think that people, even in Russia, are starting to question the direction President Putin is taking their country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why you see an international coalition building consensus around this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President will reach out to Putin again over the next couple of days this week?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any foreign leader calls in the future to read out yet.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he like to speak to Putin?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch regularly -- as soon as we have a call like that, I will happily let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, you guys made clear at the beginning of this trip that if it were necessary for him to return, he could.\xc2\xa0 Can you just give us an update on what he has done about this crisis and whether you guys have noted any reasons to go back to Washington early?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, as you point out, our number-one way of assessing these situations is if the President needs to return to Washington in order to perform his responsibilities, we will.\xc2\xa0 I do think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been fairly forthcoming in describing how we make those decisions.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, the President is the President 24 hours a day, no matter where he is.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he travels with an array of staff and communications equipment that allow him to do his job from wherever he happens to be.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why, since departing Washington yesterday, he spoke with the Dutch Prime Minister, he has spoken with National Security Advisor Susan Rice, and today, he had his presidential daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 If we have any more calls to read out, I will do so as soon as they happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe how the presidential daily briefing went for him today?\xc2\xa0 Was it a SVTC?\xc2\xa0 Was it in person?\xc2\xa0 Who was participating?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to read that out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has some downtime when he gets to L.A. and has sort of an early night tonight.\xc2\xa0 Could you give us any sense of what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing when they get there?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will check.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The background to that question is one time when he came to L.A., he went out for dinner with Katzenberg and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t find out about it until the next day.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be very eager to find out about it today if he has plans tonight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in that event, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the hotel and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we weren\xe2\x80\x99t told about it beforehand.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Noted.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the border, on your response, does that mean that the President first wants Congress to act strictly on the supplemental request and not on policy changes, or would he accept legislation that both makes changes to policy and provides the resources that he\xe2\x80\x99s asked for?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to realize that new authorities without the resources won\xe2\x80\x99t solve the problem.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we do call on Congress to pass the supplemental.\xc2\xa0 I know that some Senate Democrats are moving on a plan to do just that and we welcome that progress.\xc2\xa0 But again, as you know, we sent a letter a few weeks ago outlining new authorities we\xe2\x80\x99d like the Department of Homeland Security Secretary to be able to have.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping Congress moves on that as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any updates on Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s approach in the Middle East?<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d obviously refer you to Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s team and the good folks in Foggy Bottom for the latest.\xc2\xa0 What I have is that over the last few days, Secretary Kerry has been engaged with the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Egyptians and many other key players in the region and those with influence in the region.</p>\n<p>Our bottom line is, as Secretary Kerry has articulated both in public and in private, that no country can live with rockets raining down on it by terrorists or having terrorist tunnels underground to facilitate the killing or kidnapping of its citizens.\xc2\xa0 So Israel is doing what it must to end that threat.\xc2\xa0 But right now, given the civilian toll, there\xe2\x80\x99s an urgency to bring this entire episode to a close.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s close to helping broker a cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to handicap those negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in touch with Secretary Kerry?<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with his team.\xc2\xa0 And if I have any calls on that to read out, I will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the GAO report on abuse of health subsidies, what the White House or the administration is doing to address that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can.\xc2\xa0 I would say to make sure in your reporting you note that this was an interim report.\xc2\xa0 But our bottom line is we take fraud seriously and CMS is examining the report carefully, and we will work with GAO to identify additional ways to strengthen the verification processes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, Jim, the marketplace has several safeguards in place to verify consumer data.\xc2\xa0 People submit information under penalty of perjury and tax credits are paid directly to insurance companies, not even to enrollees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in your packet of notes that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you about that you want to -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think we covered the waterfront here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:29 P.M. PDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
