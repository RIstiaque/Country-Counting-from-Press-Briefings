Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t2:37 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 As you know, on Thursday President Obama will travel to Iowa, where he will highlight the latest item on his congressional "To-Do" list, urging Congress to support American jobs and manufacturing in the clean energy sector by passing legislation to extend the production tax credit, and expand the 48C advanced energy manufacturing tax credit.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday I am joined by Heather Zichal, Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy, who just concluded a meeting with wind energy developers and supply chain manufacturers, to discuss the value of the PTC and the 48C tax credits to a range of industries, companies and communities, and how we want to work together to ensure that they are passed.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are also joined by one of those manufacturers, Terry Royer.\xc2\xa0 Terry is CEO of Winergy Drive Systems Corporation, which is headquartered in Elgin, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago. Winergy started here in the United States with 11 employees in 2001, assembling and testing gearboxes, a key component inside a wind turbine.\xc2\xa0 Today, Winergy operates two factories in Elgin and has 380 employees.\xc2\xa0 Winergy, and the jobs they have created in Illinois, is an example of what is at stake if Congress fails to act and fails to extend clean energy tax credits.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, as with all the items on the "To-D"\xe2\x80\x9d list, this one has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past.\xc2\xa0 We certainly expect and hope that it will garner that same support moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs is the case when I have a guest, what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is turn it over to Heather, who will have some remarks; she\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Terry.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on you for any questions you have for the two of them on this particular issue.\xc2\xa0 You can save for afterward, questions on other issues.\xc2\xa0 Once they leave I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here to take those questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I give you Heather Zichal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 As Jay mentioned, the President recently proposed his "To-Do" list for Congress, which contains a number of key provisions that help create jobs and strengthen our economy.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a key energy provision on that list.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, the production tax credit, which expires at the end of this year, provides a credit per kilowatt hour for utility scale wind producers.\xc2\xa0 And second, 48C, the Advanced Energy Manufacturers credit, provides a 30 percent credit to manufacturers who invest in capital equipment to make components for clean energy projects in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s true of all the proposals, as Jay said, on the list is that they have historically been supported by both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The President will be in Newton, Iowa on Thursday to visit TPI Composites, a wind manufacturer, where they employ 700 workers.\xc2\xa0 And it demonstrates how important the production tax credit has been not only to the success of their industry but, looking forward, their continued success.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the PTC, is has very broad support across the political spectrum.\xc2\xa0 The extension is supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Governors Association, including governors like Brownback and Branstad, as well as Republicans in both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Just last fall there was a bill introduced in the House to extend the PTC.\xc2\xa0 It has about 100 co-sponsors, 21 of which were Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of why you\'re seeing real bipartisanship -- bipartisan support is because we\'ve made significant progress over the last few years in building up renewable energy in this country.\xc2\xa0 And it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to undo all of that progress, especially because thousands of American jobs across the country would be lost.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKeep in mind where we stand today.\xc2\xa0 Thanks in part to our investments in clean energy, the largest in history, the U.S. has nearly doubled renewable energy generation from wind, solar and geothermal sources since 2008.\xc2\xa0 Generation from wind turbines has increased 27 percent in the last year along, continuing a trend of rapid growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, the administration\'s combination of tax credits in deployment and manufacturing has helped increase the domestic content of clean energy technologies in recent years.\xc2\xa0 By some industry estimates, domestic content of wind turbines and components has now reached 60 percent, which is up from around 25 percent in 2005.\xc2\xa0 That means more American jobs.\xc2\xa0 In fact, today, the wind industry supports tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile these are encouraging trends, it also means that thousands of jobs, including those in the supply chain, are at risk if Congress fails to act on renewing the credits.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t guesswork.\xc2\xa0 We know from the past the when the PTC expires, orders of turbines slow, installations drop, and job losses occur.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Jay mentioned, we just wrapped up a meeting with Secretaries Salazar and Chu and a number of individuals from -- representing the wind industry.\xc2\xa0 We met with developers, those involved in construction and manufacture.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the key takeaways from that meeting I\'d like to share with you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWind, overall, we heard has made significant progress in terms of cost, reliability and efficiency.\xc2\xa0 This year was a banner year for wind production.\xc2\xa0 But without an extension of the production tax credit, we could see job losses up to 37,000.\xc2\xa0 Some of the direct quotes:\xc2\xa0 "Without a PTC, industry is about to fall of a cliff."\xc2\xa0 Because of the uncertainty, we heard stories about companies refocusing their efforts outside of the United States, taking jobs and investment dollars with them.\xc2\xa0 Another direct quote:\xc2\xa0 "We don\xe2\x80\x99t foresee any projects for 2013 in the United States."\xc2\xa0 And finally, "All of our construction base will be laid off or moved to Canada without the PTC."</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think these underscore just how important this is.\xc2\xa0 And again, with the history of bipartisanship, we are hopeful that we will be able to work with Congress and get this extension renewed as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'d like now to introduce Terry.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Heather.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a pleasure to be here today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a pleasure for me to be one of the many more than 450 manufacturing companies here in the United States that came about over the last five years because of bipartisan support for the production tax credit.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of that stable tax policy, the industry has had the ability to scale up and to grow and create real manufacturing jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor myself, as a 28-year manufacturing leader, there is no more passion than I have, and that is to create here in the United States, and that it was has happened.\xc2\xa0 As Heather has mentioned, we went from over 20 percent of a wind turbine production being made in the U.S. to more than 65 percent being produced here today.\xc2\xa0 So these are real manufacturing jobs -- jobs like my family had growing up in southeast Iowa many years ago.\xc2\xa0 So for me, as a longtime manufacturing person, the stories about job creation and continuing the work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve started five years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFour years ago, when the wind industry started to see this boom with this stable tax policy, more than 70 percent of the capacity that came online, this happened in the last four years of the installed base in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So you can see quickly how much the industry has grown, and it\xe2\x80\x99s created more than 75,000 direct jobs and indirect jobs as a result of this growth over these last four years.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for a company like mine -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate, I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking for more than 450 companies.\xc2\xa0 We started with 11 employees 10 years ago and have more than 380 employees today.\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you, with the uncertainty we\xe2\x80\x99ve already created by not extending the tax credit, my company will be impacted and many of the 480 companies will be impacted.\xc2\xa0 And not only those manufacturing companies, but all those companies -- the diner down the street from my factory, the supply chain that supplies my factory will be impacted as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for me and for all of us, we need to consider the support we have for this legislation and move it forward, because this has created real jobs and can continue to do so into the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions for Terry and Heather.\xc2\xa0 Who would like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For all of you maybe, can you talk a little bit about what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing to get congressional support for this, and what sort of reaction you\xe2\x80\x99re getting from them?\xc2\xa0 How likely is it that this will pass?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your question.\xc2\xa0 I think that, as you will hear from the President on Thursday and as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from this administration from the very beginning days since we were in office, investing in clean energy is a priority for the President.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned at the outset, the good thing about this proposal is it has a long history of bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 It also has the support of NAM, the Chamber and others.\xc2\xa0 So we are working to expand that list of support.\xc2\xa0 We are working hand-in-hand with those in industry that are able to communicate the potential job-loss stories and translate to members that are looking at this question of an extension -- to translate what that means in terms of jobs in their communities and in their home districts.\xc2\xa0 And we are working every day with our legislative team to continue the dialogue with the Hill and find vehicles to move this as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for taking our questions.\xc2\xa0 Do you have an estimate or I guess a timeframe for how long you would need the tax credits in place in terms -- because I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard estimates of two years or four years or six before the industry can kind of be self-sustaining.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 One of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to clearly stop doing and that is starting and stopping the production tax credit.\xc2\xa0 If you look over the last four years while we\xe2\x80\x99ve had it, the industry has been able to scale up, the equipment has become more efficient, the cost of a turbine has decreased by more than 30 percent over those four years.\xc2\xa0 So the industry is getting to scale to where it can stand on its own.\xc2\xa0 So the question becomes is, how much longer?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we believe firmly long term that it can stand on its own.\xc2\xa0 In fact, today, without the tax credit, we\xe2\x80\x99re competitive with everything with exception of natural gas at current prices. However, we all know that natural gas is a commodity that can change.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things I like to always point out when people talk about competition to other forms of energy -- they\xe2\x80\x99re all important.\xc2\xa0 Let me make that point.\xc2\xa0 We need all forms of energy in our portfolio for producing energy.\xc2\xa0 But let me make one thing clear.\xc2\xa0 Wind is not a commodity.\xc2\xa0 The price of wind 10 years from now will not cost any more than it does today.\xc2\xa0 So unlike natural gas, today it\xe2\x80\x99s very inexpensive, but what will it be tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 So clean energy, clean forms of energy, has got to be part of our solution long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you have an estimate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 The question is how much longer.\xc2\xa0 One thing that we can\xe2\x80\x99t do is we\xe2\x80\x99ve scaled the industry up this year -- or the last four years -- and we can\xe2\x80\x99t pull the rug out.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready to do.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a time horizon\xc2\xa0 -- you know, is it three, four, five years, but after that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the trajectory we\xe2\x80\x99ve scaled up and the cost that we brought down through the supply chain and the efficiency gained with the turbines, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in striking distance.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to predict.\xc2\xa0 Now, if we had the stopping effect that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready to do without the production tax credit, we just kill all that momentum, for sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question for Terry -- Terry, in other testimony, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that developers are saying that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get these tax credits down the pike that they could see production for 2013 -- calendar year 2013 end because if those tax credits aren\xe2\x80\x99t in place soon enough, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make those assessments.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that is sensitive?\xc2\xa0 And I guess -- Heather was saying something about moving to Canada -- your company, are you -- without these tax credits, are you not making anything next year or are you moving to Canada?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a very good question.\xc2\xa0 My company is an example of many of the component suppliers to the turbine industry by where -- and you\xe2\x80\x99re right, it is very time sensitive. In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s why last year, last fall, we really started talking about the extension of this credit now, because it does have an 18-month cycle time when you go from developing the property to get permitting to ordering the equipment to those orders that come to my factory for the gearbox.\xc2\xa0 So it does have a long cycle.\xc2\xa0 So we do expect impact next year without immediate action on this topic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for your company to expatriate, I guess?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 You know, again, all the companies like mine in the industry will be impacted and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making business adjustments accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sometimes the administration has been hesitant to give specific numbers in terms of job creation or losses.\xc2\xa0 What gives you confidence in the figure that you said, the 37,000 job losses that are a possibility?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. ZICHAL:\xc2\xa0 The number that I cited was the number that we heard directly from the industry in our conversations today.\xc2\xa0 And I think as Terry represents, there is certainly job -- there are certainly job opportunities in the clean energy sector, certainly with respect to wind energy there are tens of thousands of jobs because it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- as Terry said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the manufacturers, it\xe2\x80\x99s also about the supply chain and the additional jobs that are created there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd because of this uncertainty, businesses are forced to make very difficult decisions.\xc2\xa0 One woman in our meeting told us about the first layoff that she\xe2\x80\x99s ever had to make in the 30-year history of their company.\xc2\xa0 So I think the point here is that we know that these are jobs, they\xe2\x80\x99re real jobs, they\xe2\x80\x99re in communities across the country whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the development or manufacturing side, and we need to continue to support this industry because it\xe2\x80\x99s at a pivotal time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 Can I make a follow-up statement on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. ZICAHL:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 And to further answer your question, there is a study that was put out by the American Wind and Energy Association called the Navigate that actually speaks specifically to those statistics, of the 37,000 jobs lost.\xc2\xa0 However, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at that study also and see what the growth trajectory can continue to be if we continue on this path with this industry, and what it can mean for further job growth I think is also important to talk about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what numbers those are?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ROYER:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not quote that because I may not state it right.\xc2\xa0 But it is in the study and it\xe2\x80\x99s available.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you both very much for coming, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue with the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Heather, Terry, I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay.\xc2\xa0 I expect nothing but easy questions today for obvious reasons.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy birthday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re ready for you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is \xe2\x80\x9chaha\xe2\x80\x9d your response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s start at the top.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anybody in high places sing to you today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I had -- well, my children, in the highest place of all.\xc2\xa0 So -- but other than that, no, and I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting.\xc2\xa0 Come on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The International Atomic Energy Agency today said that they\xe2\x80\x99d reached a tentative agreement with Iran to get access to scientist sites, documents.\xc2\xa0 Last week you said that Iran needed to show concrete steps to explain what its nuclear program is about.\xc2\xa0 Is this the kind of concrete step that the administration is looking for, and does it suggest that this is the kind of thing that ultimately leads to easing sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, progress is important and we appreciate the Director General\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to conclude an agreement with Iran on the procedural framework to address the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the nature of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the announcement today is a step forward -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement in principle that represents a step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 But as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past about the totality of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s obligations and their fulfillment of them, we will make judgments about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior based on actions, not just promises or agreements -- which is not to say that this is not an important step or a useful step.\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 The P5-plus-1 negotiations, as you know, deal with the totality of the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns.\xc2\xa0 The IAEA has its specific track that it works on and this is a piece of that, which is certainly significant.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, broadly, we judge, and will judge, Iran by its actions.\xc2\xa0 And we are at this stage because, as you know, when the President took office three years ago, three and a half years ago, the world was not unified in its view of Iran.\xc2\xa0 Iran was internally unified in the position it took with regards to its failure to meet its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 That equation has reversed because of the efforts that the United States and our allies and partners on this issue have taken to develop a broad consensus about the fact that the issue here is Iranian behavior -- its refusal to live up to its international obligations, its refusal to take steps thus far to eliminate concerns about its nuclear weapons ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tIran faces a choice.\xc2\xa0 The regime faces a choice.\xc2\xa0 They can meet their international obligations and rejoin the community of nations, or continue to fail to fulfill their obligations and face significant and harsh consequences, the likes of which we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen through the unprecedented and comprehensive sanctions regime that has been leveled against Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, how adjustable are the sanctions, and does Iran specifically know what it needs to achieve for sanctions to start to peel back?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the process of discussions within the P5-plus-1 framework is where that kind of -- those kinds of issues will be brought up and litigated.\xc2\xa0 The principle that I talked about at the beginning, however, is the principle that will be applied by the United States and other members of the P5-plus-1, which is that promises are one thing; actions and fulfillment of obligations are another.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are very clear-eyed about Iranian behavior and what has taken to get us to this point.\xc2\xa0 So we will continue to pressure Tehran, continue to move forward with the sanctions that will be coming online as the year progresses, and we expect those to have the kind of effect on Iran in terms of making it clear to the regime what the price of a continued failure to meet its obligations will mean for that country and for its economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is also important to note that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve stated in the past, the first round of negotiations were positive.\xc2\xa0 They produced an opportunity to have a second round tomorrow in Baghdad, and we look for further progress.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not at the stage of negotiating what Iran would get in return for fulfillment of its obligations beyond the general principle, which is they would be able to rejoin the community of nations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question on Colin Powell today.\xc2\xa0 He said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to back the President, and wondered if the President is disappointed that a big -- a key supporter for him in \'08 is not quite there and says he wants to "keep his powder dry."</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the President\'s appreciated General Powell\'s support four years ago.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he had served in numerous -- several Republican administrations; was a self-identified, I believe, Republican.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s up to him and every American to decide whom they will support going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President -- the commitments that the President made in terms of national security and domestic policy are commitments that he has worked extremely hard to fulfill in office.\xc2\xa0 I think in the national security realm, which has, I think, particular resonance with General Powell, the President\'s record has been judged to be exemplary by outside observers and commentators, whether it\'s taking the fight effectively to al Qaeda, ending the war in Iraq, having a plan to refocus our efforts in Afghanistan and then begin to end that war -- something you heard a lot about over the weekend at NATO -- the rebalancing of our foreign policy towards Asia because of the importance of that region of the world in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 These are all significant accomplishments that the President has achieved just in the past three-and-a-half years.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly looks forward to discussing that record in the debate that comes as the year progresses.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President, the White House expect to get any kind of a political bump out of what happened this weekend and yesterday?\xc2\xa0 A lot of the issues were obviously foreign policy issues, but also have resonance in the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the kind of thing that you -- the kinds of issues that were discussed, both at the G8 and at the NATO summit are matters of international economic growth, as well as U.S. national security and alliance security.\xc2\xa0 These are weighty substantive issues.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not something that I think most Americans view through a political lens, and they\'re certainly not something that the President views through a political lens. When it comes to the first basket that was a subject of discussion at the G8 -- the international economy, the measures that Europe has taken and needs to take to address the eurozone crisis -- obviously those have an effect on the American economy, and, therefore, Americans as they cope with their personal economic situation as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has spoken very clearly about the fact that Europe and instability there remains a headwind to the global economy and therefore the American economy, which only reinforces the need for us in the United States, for the elected officials who were sent here by their constituents to get the work done that the people want, to focus on the things they can get done to help the economy grow and help it create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has an agenda that does just that and is filled with items, as we talked about earlier, on the "To-Do" list that have traditionally enjoyed support from both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 So we need to act on the things that we can control to help insulate the American economy and the American people from the kinds of headwinds that we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced in the past and we continue to experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Outside of Chicago do you get the impression or think that Americans -- have we been paying attention to the summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Americans care deeply about the issues that were discussed at NATO.\xc2\xa0 For example, the United States has been at war in Afghanistan for more than 10 years.\xc2\xa0 The cost of that war as well as the war that President Obama ended in Iraq have been profound both in terms of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform as well as the financial cost.\xc2\xa0 So the American people I think have a keen interest in this, and they have a keen interest in a policy that is very focused on Afghanistan, that has the support of all of our ISAF and NATO allies, and that contains within it a vision for transferring responsibility for Afghan security to Afghan forces as the United States draws down.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has a vision for ending this war responsibly, ending U.S. engagement in this war responsibly, while fulfilling the mission objectives that he laid out after review of a policy, which, as you know, was adrift when he came into office.\xc2\xa0 That situation has changed dramatically, and I think the United States and I think the American people have a great interest in that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the G8 statement in sort of linking towards -- or leaning towards growth versus austerity, does that help the President in his similar debate with Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing this through -- everything through sort of the political lens or sort of electoral lens, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not how the President views it.\xc2\xa0 I think that these macro issues affect and matter deeply to the American people at a macro level.\xc2\xa0 The need for balance in the approach that European countries take to the eurozone crisis I think is one that is broadly -- is something that is shared by leaders across the region, as well as obviously by the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think most Americans simply want to make sure that their President is working with his European counterparts to advise the Europeans on a way forward for them that creates the kinds of stability in Europe that European leaders clearly want, the European people -- people in these European countries clearly want, and obviously that would be beneficial to our economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tWendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The current round of P5-plus-1 talks, does the President see this as the last chance of resolving the issue over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program diplomatically, meaning that if they break down at some point with positive results in the first, the second is not so positive?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about specific meetings and the results of -- the turns that may await down the road.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that there is a limited period of time here.\xc2\xa0 The window is open, the potential for a diplomatic solution here remains, and it is the best possible solution to this problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put not only significant U.S. resources into this effort but has rallied the international community in support of this effort -- not just the negotiations but everything that preceded it, which was unifying the international community, creating a consensus about Iranian behavior, creating a broad coalition of nations that have agreed to the most stringent sanctions regime in history -- a regime that has resulted in real impacts on the Iranian economy and the Iranian political situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President has made clear that this -- there is not an infinite amount of time here for the Iranians to act.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is so important for them to take seriously these negotiations, to take seriously the opportunity created here for Iran to rejoin the community of nations if the leadership so chooses to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another matter -- the President has voiced support for the Occupy folks in the past, or at least their goals.\xc2\xa0 Did their actions in Chicago sour his support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re making broad comparisons between different groups.\xc2\xa0 What the President has said in the past is that he has understood the frustrations that Americans have about the failure, in particular, of Wall Street, in some cases to -- well, because obviously Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s role in the financial crisis that helped precipitate the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 That is I think, one channel here that he was talking about in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President addressed the protests in Chicago yesterday in his press conference and commended Chicago for how it carried out the NATO summit, and believes that every leader who attended felt that it was a success.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around a little bit, then I\'ll come back.\xc2\xa0 Tommy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Happy birthday, by the way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this morning, Ed Rendell apparently became the latest Democrat to pile on President Obama in defense of Bain capital.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you could tell us just how angry is the President that he\'s sort of become this -- like a reverse Sister Souljah for every Democrat who wants to score points with private equity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President addressed this yesterday when he was asked about it in the press conference, so I would point you to his words.\xc2\xa0 And I will echo them by simply making the point that the issue here is not whether private equity plays a role in our economy; the issue is what experience do you bring to the presidency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President I think was very clear that the President\'s job is not just to maximize the profits of a few; it\'s to look out for all the shareholders in America -- in other words, all American citizens.\xc2\xa0 And that includes -- from top to bottom, that includes the most fortunate among us as well as those who might have been laid off from a company that failed, or in a downsizing or restructure; help making sure that programs are available for job retraining, or to ensure that those Americans have adequate health care.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s not -- I think the point that the President made yesterday was very clear.\xc2\xa0 The issue is, if you\'re -- somebody who aspires to the presidency is saying that the number-one criterion for the job that he has is his experience in business, and that he would bring to the job of the presidency the same approach that he brought to business, it is absolutely appropriate to examine what that would mean in practice, and what that approach would mean.\xc2\xa0 And his point I think yesterday was simply that that is not the approach that he has.\xc2\xa0 And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, I think it\'s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t he angry that every Democrat -- I think he addressed --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think he addressed this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Well, I think "every Democrat" is a gross abuse of the facts, but, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question was sort of related.\xc2\xa0 Another question I\'ve heard asked a lot about this is, isn\'t it hypocritical for the President to attack Mitt Romney\'s record at Bain Capital and yet hold fundraisers and take donations from --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The issue is -- those folks aren\'t running for President.\xc2\xa0 They do not believe that their experience in their line of work wholly qualifies them to sit in the Oval Office and be Commander-In-Chief and make the kinds of decisions on the economy that a President must make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe appreciates support from Americans from every walk of life and from every area of the economy.\xc2\xa0 And as you know -- I\'m sure you\'ve reported on it -- the fact of the matter is, the President\'s support, as demonstrated by contributions, comes demonstrably from small -- people who just contribute a little bit.\xc2\xa0 They are not from huge donors at all.\xc2\xa0 And for more details on that, I\'m sure the campaign can help you fill in the blanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Tommy\'s question.\xc2\xa0 Why would you conclude, or why would the White House, the President conclude that because Mitt Romney ran his private equity firm a certain way that he would run the country the same way?\xc2\xa0 He\'s -- Mr. Romney has talked about experience that he has from that.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that he would then start taking the same actions as President, right?\xc2\xa0 The President took his experience\xc2\xa0 -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he started running the country like a community organizer or like a state senator; he just had experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but the experience he had as a community organizer and state senator, and then as a United States senator were the experience that he believed helped qualify him for the presidency.\xc2\xa0 He made the case that that record --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it as a community organizer; he did it as President.\xc2\xa0 And my only -- my question is, why are you saying that he would run things as --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because the governor himself -- the former governor himself has said as much.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not running -- that I can tell -- on his record -- or that you can because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- on his record in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s running as a businessman who can do for America what he did in private equity. And I think Americans would expect that that credential deserves some scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all that\xe2\x80\x99s happening here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to put it in the context of different ideas about how we move the country forward, economically -- what the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision is, both what his record is so far and since the end of the recession, since his policies have kicked in, the creation of more than 4 million private sector jobs, 11 straight quarters of economic growth -- and then compare that to -- and what he would do to continue to invest in education and infrastructure and innovation to ensure that our economy grows, his balanced approach to deficit reduction and dealing with our long-term debt challenges -- and compare that to what Republicans in general, across the board, Republicans who support the Ryan/Republican budget, including the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party and the President\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, what they would do.\xc2\xa0 And what they say they would do is revert to the same policies that were in place in the run-up to the financial and economic collapse, the worst recession any of us -- most of us -- Lester, sorry -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in our lifetimes. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong about that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the Republicans haven\xe2\x80\x99t put forward is an alternative that is any different from the very policies that helped bring about this -- so policies that maximize benefits for the wealthiest Americans and hope that those benefits trickle down to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I will entertain another question -- but trickle down to middle-class Americans are not policies that this President agrees with.\xc2\xa0 He has a different vision.\xc2\xa0 They are also not policies that we need to theorize about because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them tried and we saw what happened.\xc2\xa0 We saw middle-class incomes stagnate or decline.\xc2\xa0 We saw the most fortunate and wealthiest Americans see their incomes increase dramatically.\xc2\xa0 And then we saw the whole economy collapse.\xc2\xa0 Not really what you would expect somebody who wants to be President to say he wants to repeat, but there you have it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a new ABC News-Washington Post poll in which twice as many people say they are worse off now, under President Obama than say they\xe2\x80\x99re better off.\xc2\xa0 For most people it\xe2\x80\x99s about the same.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s 30 percent say they\xe2\x80\x99re worse off now, 16 percent say they\xe2\x80\x99re better off.\xc2\xa0 Under the tried and true standard of, are you better off than you were four years ago, does this not give President Obama pause?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that a finding like that needs to be viewed in context, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain why.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to step back?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, not that far.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, four years ago today, we were just in the early stages of economic freefall.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment had not yet skyrocketed to the point that it would as a result of the recession.\xc2\xa0 We had not quite gotten to the period where the economy would contract by 9 percent -- nearly 9 percent -- as it did at the end of 2008, where four years ago would be the middle of 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is a fact that the worst recession since the Great Depression had not fully blossomed four years ago.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the same data, most Americans I think agree with the idea that that recession was caused -- its causes predated President Obama taking office.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that most Americans recognize that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it is also a fact that if you ask most Americans, do they want to go back to the policies that helped lead to that situation, the answer would be no.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that since President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s policies have taken effect, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a reverse of all those trends.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen economic growth, steadily -- not enough, but steady economic growth.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a situation that went from hemorrhaging of 800,000 jobs a month to a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99ve created private sector jobs every month for over two years.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe still have further to travel on this road to recovery, but there is no question that the circumstance we\xe2\x80\x99re in now, economically, and the trajectory that we\xe2\x80\x99re on, economically, is better than the trajectory that this country was on four years ago today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just one last quick one.\xc2\xa0 The Romney campaign has put out a web video about Delphi in which workers from that company, who are non-union workers, who feel like they got shafted in the deal that the Obama administration helped put together during that bailout, talk about how they feel like they were victims, and how the Obama administration picked winners and losers and opted to give union personnel a better deal than non-union personnel.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the ad, but I think the President is very proud of the record that he has and those who worked with him on it to help save the automobile industry.\xc2\xa0 I think if that\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that Republicans want to have in the summer and fall, I personally look forward to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, is that every one of those workers at companies like that one and many others across the country would have lost their jobs if General Motors and Chrysler had been allowed to fail and eventually liquidate, which was the only alternative to the action that the President took.\xc2\xa0 It is simply a fact that had that action not been taken, against a lot of the sage advice of both economic and political of a lot of people, those jobs would have been lost and we would no longer have the number-one automaker in the world.\xc2\xa0 We would no longer be in a situation where we are creating manufacturing jobs at a rapid pace for the first time in this country in a long time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The non-union workers who felt --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this specific ad, but the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you know the details of that particular company\xe2\x80\x99s bailout?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but just, again, listening to what you say -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the details of that particular company\xe2\x80\x99s situation.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that the alternative to the actions the President took is the loss of all those jobs -- everybody\xe2\x80\x99s job in that industry.\xc2\xa0 The President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to let that happen.\xc2\xa0 He insisted that companies that received taxpayer support only received it if they took steps to reform themselves and improve the kinds of products that they were producing.\xc2\xa0 That has happened, again, and for that reason GM, Chrysler as well as Ford are stronger now than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in years.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Bain, is the Bain attack not driven in part by concern in the administration and in the campaign that when you look at the national numbers out there, that most Americans think that Romney is better on the economy than the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can just repeat what I said.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what the President said.\xc2\xa0 Again, citing the President, if someone who is running for President and is, in this case, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, is citing as his primary credential, the reason why he should be voted into the White House, his experience in business and that experience is what he did at this particular firm, it certainly bears scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was talking about yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But aren\xe2\x80\x99t you trying to undermine the fact that most Americans think that he is stronger on the economy than the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I would say "most Americans" is a -- again, Tom, is a slight exaggeration of the facts.\xc2\xa0 But what we have said when you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked questions about polls showing that Americans still have anxiety about the economy is we completely understand that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to continue to make sure we\'re taking steps in May of 2012 to help the economy grow and help it create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Because the hole dug by that terrible recession was very deep and we are still only part of the way out of that hole, and we saw this economy lose 8 million jobs as a result, in part, because of the policies that were in place prior to when President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve now recovered a substantial number of those jobs, but not nearly enough.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to continue to do everything we can, working with Congress, working in an administration way, to help the economy grow, to help businesses like the one represented here earlier at the briefing grow and hire American workers for manufacturing jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 We need to do all these things to make sure that this economy continues to grow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is behind Ambassador Crocker\'s decision to leave Afghanistan early?\xc2\xa0 And what kind of impact do you think this will have on the wind-down there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Ambassador, Ambassador Crocker, is leaving for health reasons.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to the State Department as well as the Ambassador himself for more on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, at the President\'s request Ambassador Crocker came out of retirement to take this post.\xc2\xa0 The President is enormously grateful for that, for Ambassador Crocker\'s hugely valuable service to this country and his long career in Afghanistan, in Iraq and previous posts.\xc2\xa0 He has done an extraordinary job in this current post, and he has been a key part of the implementation of the President\'s strategy in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That strategy will continue, obviously.\xc2\xa0 The leadership team is strong, and the President looks forward to the further implementation of his strategy, as we just discussed over the weekend at the NATO summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tKate, and then Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken with Corey Booker since Sunday?\xc2\xa0 And if not, has anyone in the administration or any campaign officials reach out to him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to read out.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that the President had a conversation like that and I\'m not aware of anybody who has spoken to him.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying they haven\'t, I just -- I have heard nothing on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a plan in place for Corey Booker to campaign on the President\'s behalf?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President addressed this.\xc2\xa0 The President cited Mayor Booker\'s very significant work as mayor; he\'s done a terrific job.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that.\xc2\xa0 And I think on this issue, the President spoke eloquently about how he views it and why he think it\'s -- it goes right to the heart of what we fully expect, and you fully expect, and, apparently, the President\'s opponent expects to be the main subject of the campaign, which is, what is your vision for America\'s economic future?\xc2\xa0 And is it doubling down on the policies of the past?\xc2\xa0 Is it going backward to an economic policy that envisions not just the Bush era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans but even more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans; envisions retaining subsidies for oil and gas companies and corporate jets and the like?\xc2\xa0 It envisions voucherizing Medicare, and an overall deficit and debt reduction plan that would result -- because it asks nothing more of the wealthiest -- would ask a huge amount from students and seniors and veterans and the like.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\'s that vision on the one hand, and the President\'s vision, which is a balanced approach towards deficit and debt reduction; investments in education, innovation, research and development and infrastructure; a situation where we deal with our long-term fiscal challenges by ensuring that everyone gets a fair shot and everybody plays by the same rules.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\'s vision and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be central to the debate this fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will Corey Booker, though, be campaigning on his behalf?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign for matters of campaign surrogates.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that having been in private equity is a disqualifier for holding the office of the President?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s point is that it is not the -- that private equity is an important part of our economy.\xc2\xa0 The difference -- the issue here is that his likely opponent has made clear that his number-one credential for being President, as he sees it, the one that he is telling the American people is the reason he should be voted into the highest office in the land, is his experience running a financial company.\xc2\xa0 And we know how that has played out -- the policies that are produced from that vision played out in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 We know, broadly speaking, how the policies that the Republicans support and the likely nominee supports played out in the first decade of this century.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President just has a profoundly different view of how we need to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think he made a very important point about what a President\xe2\x80\x99s job is.\xc2\xa0 A President\xe2\x80\x99s job is not the job of -- is not the same as being a CEO of a financial firm where your absolute primary objective is to maximize profits for your shareholders and investors.\xc2\xa0 And within the economy, that is a very valuable thing to do, but it is not the same experience -- or the same perspective that the President believes is the best for a President to have when he or she sits in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There has been criticism, though, that there\xe2\x80\x99s been some cherry-picking of some negative examples and there were jobs created by Bain, too.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, Sununu said on a conference call today, a Romney conference call, that the Obama campaign is cherry-picking just the negative examples.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that, but I did hear that he also said it was absolutely appropriate to examine that record.\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get into the specifics of a campaign ad, I really encourage you to talk to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to what the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision is, what his perspective is, the things that he said in the press conference yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.\xc2\xa0 But on the specifics of campaign strategy and the contents of this or other ads, I refer you to the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On contraception, as you know, Catholic institutions are now suing the administration, and they said that the administration is stifling religious freedom by defining who\xe2\x80\x99s exempt from providing contraception.\xc2\xa0 Cardinal Dolan was on CBS this morning and he said that it\xe2\x80\x99s a "straight-jacketing and a hand-cuffing exemption."\xc2\xa0 Any response to Cardinal Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s comments?\xc2\xa0 Is that what the President is doing, is straight-jacking and hand-cuffing religious institutions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Norah, the administration has worked closely with all communities of faith, including officials from Notre Dame and other Catholic institutions, to hear their concerns and promote the common good.\xc2\xa0 And our doors remain open to faith and community leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the President -- the policy the President has outlines -- or rather, that he has outlined, meets two important objectives.\xc2\xa0 One, it ensures that women have access to important preventive services, including contraception.\xc2\xa0 Two, it respects religious liberty.\xc2\xa0 Under this policy, no religious university or religious organization will have to pay for or refer for contraceptive services.\xc2\xa0 And no religious institution will have to provide these services directly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to work to develop final rules that implement that policy.\xc2\xa0 And as we do, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to ensure that millions of American women receive the preventative services that they need.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think their suit is meritless?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t comment on a specific lawsuit.\xc2\xa0 I can simply tell you what the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is and remind you that the President has worked with leaders of religious institutions on this issue.\xc2\xa0 He has instructed his team to do that and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so as we take further steps to implementing this rule.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 The objective that the President outlined is twofold -- one, ensure that women across America receive these important preventive services, including contraception; and two, respect religious liberty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as he has reminded you, began his first job in Chicago in a position that was funded in part by Catholic Charities or Catholic institutions.\xc2\xa0 So he is very well aware of the important role that institutions like that play in our society, the fact that they can provide services that can be more helpful than any government program as he has said.\xc2\xa0 He believes strongly in religious liberty and the need to protect it.\xc2\xa0 He also believes strongly in the need to give women access to and provide preventive services that are essential, including contraception.\xc2\xa0 And the policy the President put in place meets those objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Is it a failure on the part of the administration that officials weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to secure a deal with Pakistan to reopen its supply routes during the NATO summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with Pakistan on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We did not anticipate that the supply line issue was going to be resolved prior to the summit.\xc2\xa0 And our teams continue to meet and we\xe2\x80\x99re making diligent progress.\xc2\xa0 We expect this issue to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 We have said that, the government of Pakistan has said that and we expect it to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you guarantee a successful transition out of Afghanistan without this deal in place?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this essential to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Pentagon and ISAF for details on those routes and the role they play in terms of supplying resources to our troops in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The fact is Pakistan says it wants to resolve this; we obviously are interested in resolving it; it will be resolved, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident. We did not anticipate it would be resolved prior to the summit.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to work towards its resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But going back to my original question, does the President see it as essentially a failure?\xc2\xa0 Is he disappointed by the fact --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- how could he be disappointed by -- you\xe2\x80\x99re basically setting up a straw man that says it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t resolved before the summit.\xc2\xa0 I just told you we didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be resolved before the summit --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- or during the summit.\xc2\xa0 He met briefly with President Zardari.\xc2\xa0 There was no expectation for it to be resolved during the summit.\xc2\xa0 This is being worked on diligently by representatives of both governments and we expect them to be resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have an easy question.\xc2\xa0 Can you preview at all the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech tomorrow in front of Air Force cadets, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the right phrase?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At the Air Force Academy?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that I will have to leave you filled with anticipation, because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the speech yet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll do one more.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the head of the Secret Service is scheduled to give his first public testimony on misconduct in Cartagena.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe in light of the embarrassing nature of the scandal and the fact that it overshadowed the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit there that Mark Sullivan should apologize to the public or to the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has addressed this issue on a couple of occasions.\xc2\xa0 He has great faith in the Secret Service, believes the director has done an excellent job.\xc2\xa0 The director moved very quickly to have this matter investigated and took action very quickly as a result of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to anticipate his testimony.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final thing.\xc2\xa0 There is now stories that this issue now encapsulates another agency with the DEA now investigating its own staff for having prostitutes in Cartagena.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that this is like the Secret Service is saying, an isolated case or is there something more to be looked at?\xc2\xa0 Are you comfortable with --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is the DEA is going to conduct its own investigation, so I would refer you to the DEA.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, all.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:33 P.M.
