PDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here aboard Air Force One as we fly east towards home.\xc2\xa0 I hope you enjoyed our trip today and the visit to Camp Pendleton. I know the President did.</p>\n<p>I have no announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 I know we put out a variety of announcements today earlier in Washington, so beyond that, I\'ll just take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything more you can tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making process to not go to Russia?\xc2\xa0 When did he make that decision?\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to talk to Putin before he goes to the G20?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the last question, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any calls scheduled or conversation scheduled.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there is a meeting scheduled for Friday, a two-plus-two, foreign and defense ministers, and I think that that represents the fact that we continue to have issues of importance to discuss with the Russians, and we will certainly do that.</p>\n<p>The President, like his whole national security team, wanted the Moscow summit decision to be made on the merits, and we looked at the utility of the summit in light of a number of issues and a number of challenges that we\'ve encountered and decided that it did not make sense to have that bilateral summit in Moscow in September.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the final decision, though, to scrap the summit?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a time and an hour, but we announced it reasonably soon after the decision was made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say that the reset with Russia is now over?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that we have important relations with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 We engage with them on a variety of matters and we have been able over the years to cooperate and find new cooperation with the Russians as part of the so-called reset approach.\xc2\xa0 And some of that cooperation continues and is important, including the supply of our troops in Afghanistan as well as cooperation in other areas, as you know.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\'ve encountered some challenges in our relations with Russia more recently, but it also should not be viewed entirely in a black-and-white fashion. Even several years ago, as we were making progress in our relationship with Russia in some areas, we continued to have disagreements with them on missile defense and other matters.</p>\n<p>So that has always been the case and we\'ve managed to continue to engage in this important relationship because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So we will do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you were debating whether or not to have the summit did the pros of having a one-on-one, face-to-face meeting to talk about Edward Snowden weigh in at all?\xc2\xa0 Do you see any -- obviously that\'s not what you decided, but wouldn\'t that have also been perhaps worth having an Obama-Putin discussion on?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President and President Putin did speak by phone, as we have previously discussed, and Mr. Snowden was one topic of discussion among several others -- or many others.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the Russians clearly understood our perspective.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There was not another argument to be made about our view that there was ample legal justification for Mr. Snowden to be returned to the United States to face the charges brought against him as a defendant afforded all the protections and rights of defendants in this country.\xc2\xa0 The arguments that we made or the points we made in public were very much the points we made in private, and not just at the presidential level, but at a variety of levels, including senior law enforcement channels as well as at the Foreign Minister level or Secretary of State level.</p>\n<p>So I think that that discussion was had.\xc2\xa0 Russia made a decision that was disappointing.\xc2\xa0 But the judgment was made that for a variety of reasons, this was not an optimum time to have a summit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that this could escalate into leading to trouble for some of the cooperative efforts that the U.S. and Russia are engaged in?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t necessarily see that.\xc2\xa0 Again, we are continuing to meet and have discussions with our Russian counterparts.\xc2\xa0 We have a host of issues that we need to engage on between us and we\'ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 And I think I pointed out that even when we\'ve made progress in some areas in our relations with Russia we have continued to encounter disagreement in other areas, and I expect that will be the case going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect any other ways that the administration and the President will express their disappointment and frustration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any expectation of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I may have missed something just because we\'ve been in the air, but have you heard from the Russians since this announcement was made?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had any discussions. I\'m sure the State Department and maybe the Defense Department, because as they\xe2\x80\x99re setting up additional meetings or another meeting, might have had conversations with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Friday meeting is a wide-ranging meeting; it would deal with Snowden, but a variety of other issues?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 I think -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a meeting about Snowden.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to State and Defense for more detail about the two-and-two.\xc2\xa0 These are -- again, we have a broad range of significant matters that we regularly engage with the Russians on, and these kinds of meetings focus on that broad range of issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President won\'t be going to Moscow, but you did announce that Sweden is now on the itinerary.\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell us a little bit about how that decision was made, why Sweden?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really don\'t have a lot of detail on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Sweden is an important country and a key partner in many areas, and we look forward to that meeting.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more details about the visit in the days ahead, and I know the President looks forward to making the trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the Sweden visit even under consideration before the decision to scrap the summit was made?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that a visit to Sweden has been under consideration for some time, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just clarify something last night?\xc2\xa0 In the interview, the President said that he thought that Putin was the head of the KGB.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s impression, that Putin was once headed up the KGB?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously President Putin had a long and senior career in intelligence, which is well known.\xc2\xa0 As I recall, and you can check my facts, he was head in the Leningrad region -- perhaps not head of the overall organization.\xc2\xa0 But I think the point the President was making is that President Putin did spend quite a bit of his formative years in the KGB.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the idea -- the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t suggesting that he\xe2\x80\x99d led the KGB?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I believe he was making the point that President Putin spent a long time in his formative years in the KGB.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Officials in Yemen today claimed that they\xe2\x80\x99ve broken up some kind of large al Qaeda plot.\xc2\xa0 One, has the administration been briefed on what the Yemenis are saying?\xc2\xa0 And then, two, is that plot that they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the same as the threat that has led to the embassy closures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the threat, I have no updates and am not aware of any new information that would lead us to change our approach in terms of the precautions we are taking as a result of that threat and in reaction to it.\xc2\xa0 On the other matter, we work, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, cooperatively with Yemen on counterterrorism and welcome any successes in that effort.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details on the announcement that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps the Defense or State Department will have more.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether what they are talking about is the same as what has led to the closures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can say is that it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that we have not made any changes in the steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in reaction to the threat that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing these last several days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:59 P.M. PDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
