HAMMER:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everybody, for holding on.\xc2\xa0 I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to wait a little bit.\xc2\xa0 But we have with us for this briefing -- which will now be on the record.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the record.\xc2\xa0 We have Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications; Mike Froman, Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics -- and of course, you all know him as our stellar sherpa.\xc2\xa0 We have Ambassador Jeff Bader, who is Senior Director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council; and we have Mr. Danny Russel, who is Director of Korea and Japan at the National Security Council.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I will turn over the beginning for Ben.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say a quick few words here and turn it over to my colleagues.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President had a busy afternoon of bilateral meetings, beginning with a meeting with Prime Minister Cameron -- actually following about a nearly one-hour helicopter ride on Marine One from the G8 to the G20, where they were able to have some discussions, and continued it in their bilateral meeting, focusing on Afghanistan, Iran, Middle East peace, and the global economy.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the other two meetings he had this afternoon were with the Republic of Korea and then with China.\xc2\xa0 And as we said in the lead-up to this summit, the United States has put a particular focus on renewing our engagement and leadership in Asia.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have bilats tomorrow with Indonesia, as well as with Japan.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, with that, I\'ll turn it to Mike, who can begin with an overview of what took place today on trade.\xc2\xa0 And then Jeff can fill in on the other aspects of the Korea bilat and the China bilat.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As many of you know, the President announced today that, to create jobs and improve the economy for all Americans, he was launching an initiative to complete the Korean-U.S. free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 In his bilateral meeting with President Lee, he informed President Lee of his intention or his plans to ask U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk to initiate new discussions with his counterpart to resolve the outstanding issues in a way that would level the playing field and allow those issues to get resolved for the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to South Korea in November for the next G20 summit.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also told President Lee of his intent that once those issues had been resolved, he would plan to submit the Korean FTA to Congress in the following months. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This, as you know, is an important agreement.\xc2\xa0 Korea is a large and growing market.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the 14th largest economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 We export about $50 billion worth of goods and services to Korea, and this trade agreement is expected to add another $10 billion -- $10 billion to $11 billion a year just in goods, and when services are added, substantially more than that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President decided to do this as part of our national export initiative to expand -- double our exports over the next five years and increase the jobs -- the good-paying jobs that are associated with exports, and to maintain a competitiveness of U.S. exporters and our engagement in Asia.\xc2\xa0 Korea is a place where our market share of their imports has declined from 23 percent to 9 percent over the last 20 years.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got other actors in the field -- the EU, Canada and others -- negotiating free trade agreements with Korea and others.\xc2\xa0 And the President decided that the U.S., in order to maintain and increase its market share in with some very important markets who export both goods, services and agricultural products, that the free trade agreement -- he would move forward with the free trade agreement if we can resolve the outstanding issues.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The outstanding issues include non-tariff measures related to autos and beef.\xc2\xa0 And the President and President Lee agreed that they would have their two trade ministers have discussions about how to proceed between now and the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Seoul in November, with the goal of resolving those issues at that time.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mike.\xc2\xa0 Jeff Bader will now give us a little bit more on the Korean bilat as well as the China bilat.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR BADER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mike.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, the Korea bilat.\xc2\xa0 The other issues that came up were -- first the President expressed his strong solidarity with President Lee and the Korean people in the wake of the sinking of the Cheonan; the unshakeable commitment of the United States to the alliance with the Republic of Korean and to the defense of the Republic of Korea.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He noted that we\xe2\x80\x99re working together to craft a clear message in response to the North Korean actions, including at the U.N. Security Council, where the South Koreans, U.S., and other members have been making progress on a statement.\xc2\xa0 That will part of the reaction, but not the entire reaction.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition, the President, at the request of President Lee, agreed that the -- what\xe2\x80\x99s called opcon, operational control over South Korean forces in wartime, should be -- transfer of that operational control should be postponed from 2012 to the end of 2015.\xc2\xa0 This was done at the -- the South Koreans first raised this with us early in the year, I believe in February, before the Cheonan.\xc2\xa0 The purpose of the decision is to send a clear message of the U.S. staying power in the region, at a time when that message is important.\xc2\xa0 Given North Korean conduct over the last year and a half, we judged it important to respond positively to President Lee\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that we stretch out the transfer of operational control by a few years.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another subject that arose was Iran.\xc2\xa0 The President appreciated South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s support for the U.N. Security Council resolution and stressed the need for firm implementation of the resolution by all countries, including South Korea.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The China bilateral -- I think this was the sixth meeting between President Obama and President Hu.\xc2\xa0 The topics covered -- there was a discussion of economic and trade issues, of Iran, and of North Korea.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the President extended an invitation to President Hu to visit the United States on a state visit.\xc2\xa0 President Hu accepted, and the two sides will work out the timing.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically in each subject -- on North Korea, the President noted that we could not tolerate North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s attack on the Cheonan, that we had to send a clear message in response at the U.N. Security Council and elsewhere; that we looked to China to help reinforce that message, including at the U.N. Security Council.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, we expressed -- President Obama expressed appreciation for China\xe2\x80\x99s help in crafting Resolution 1929 at the U.N. and called on China to work with us on implementation of the resolution.\xc2\xa0 The President also described the legislation that is passing -- that is in the process of passing the Congress, and what the impact would be upon Iran.\xc2\xa0 And the President finally emphasized that we remain committed to a diplomatic track with Iran -- if the Iranians will come to the table and take the necessary steps, that the 1929 did not end the diplomatic track but makes it possible.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On economic issues, the President stressed the need for balanced and sustainable growth and the role that China could play in contributing to balanced and sustainable growth.\xc2\xa0 He said that he welcomed the Chinese announcement of their decision to increase flexibility in their foreign exchange regime, noted that implementation of it was very important.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He stressed the need for a level playing field on trade issues, including issues such as the consultation on issues such as innovation and industrial policy and for improvements in the Chinese intellectual property regime.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 With that, we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take any of your questions.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gentlemen, thank you for taking the time to speak with us this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 On the China bilat, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask did the President raise the issue of China\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to renew military-to-military dialogue, and what was the Chinese response?\xc2\xa0 On the Cheonan incident, what is your time frame for getting out the U.N. statement, and will it have any actual consequences for North Korea?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR BADER:\xc2\xa0 Josh, Jeff Bader.\xc2\xa0 First on the military-to-military issue, the issue was discussed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d actually let the Chinese side speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 But the two sides -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say the two sides agreed on the importance of military-to-military relations both as part of the broader bilateral relationship and as a contribution to regional and global stability.\xc2\xa0 There was not a difference in assessing the overall importance or value of a military-to-military relationship.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Chinese have restricted it for their own reasons.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for the Cheonan action in the Security Council, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a deadline.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking to get good action, good statements out of the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a deadline.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, good evening.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you can handle a question about the U.S.-British bilat.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We can take a question, although these guys were in the Asia bilats so we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be giving you the kind of firsthand information that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be giving on the Asia ones.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 When will we have a readout on the Cameron/Obama bilat?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We can get you something here in the not too distant future.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 My question is, going into the meeting, Prime Minister Cameron had told an interviewer here in Canada that he planned to \xe2\x80\x9cmake the case through quiet diplomacy for BP.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if he did do that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President and the Prime Minister have had conversations about BP at several times leading up to this bilat.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that it did come up in the bilat and that, again, the leaders have been in agreement that BP has certain obligations to cap the leak and to clean up the damage and to provide compensation to those who have legitimate claims and that -- they\xe2\x80\x99re in agreement that BP must pay out those obligations.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again -- so my understanding is, yes, it did come up and that they reiterated their agreement on those issues.\xc2\xa0 And again, we can see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to add to that.\xc2\xa0 I can check with my colleagues, but that was my understanding of how the conversation went.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Would appreciate it very much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, good evening.\xc2\xa0 I have an inquiry about the Korean FTA.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do to revise the FTA enough to placate Congress and the automakers without doing so much that it alienates the Koreans?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 We are first going to complete some consultations with Congress and stakeholders.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll then enter into discussions with the Koreans with the goal of resolving the outstanding issues, which include, as I mentioned, non-tariff barriers in the auto sector and in the beef sector.\xc2\xa0 And that will be our objective between now and November.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President has made clear from the start of his administration that he would like to move forward with this agreement if those outstanding items could be resolved.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a fairly clear consensus as to what those outstanding items are and there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness on both sides to sit down and try and resolve them.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I had another, further question on the Korean FTA.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you could go a little further in distinguishing them from pledges that the President has made in the past to renew efforts on this agreement, particularly in November in Seoul.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m also wondering how exactly this would be done.\xc2\xa0 Could you go a little bit more into the procedural aspects of it?\xc2\xa0 Is this a series of amendments or side agreements?\xc2\xa0 How does this actually happen?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think this goes further than what -- you were right that in November when the President was in Korea, he then said that he would like, as I said, to move forward with the agreement if the outstanding issues could be resolved.\xc2\xa0 And what is different at this point is that he is prepared to direct his team, his U.S. Trade Representative and his counterpart, to sit down and to begin to discuss those issues, with the timetable of trying to resolve those issues by -- or for his visit in November to Seoul.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the modalities, the focus at this point is going to be on the substance of the outstanding items.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with the Koreans to explore various modalities.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, yes, thanks.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve answered some of the questions.\xc2\xa0 But I wanted to come back to the talks with China on encouraging its own domestic growth.\xc2\xa0 Any promise from the Chinese on working your concerns about indigenous innovation?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that resolving that is essential to meeting your goal of doubling exports.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR BADER:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President did raise the innovation issue and industrial policy with President Hu, noted how important these were to growth and U.S. exports.\xc2\xa0 I would say that -- again, without characterizing President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s answers, which I\xe2\x80\x99d rather the Chinese side did, I would say that he reiterated that the Chinese side is committed to ensuring a level playing field for foreign and domestic enterprises. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 In reference to the North Korean torpedo incident, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked repeatedly about showing solidarity with the South Koreans, and one aspect of that is obviously a military show of force.\xc2\xa0 There has been some discussion in Washington in recent weeks about a possible increased U.S. involvement in terms of a show of solidarity with the South Koreans.\xc2\xa0 There had been some reports in Washington about the USS George Washington and others -- other sort of ships heading to the region.\xc2\xa0 Can you discuss that and whether it was discussed with the President and the South Korean leader?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RUSSEL:\xc2\xa0 This won\'t come as a surprise to you that we don\'t comment about military operations.\xc2\xa0 But the President, previously in his telephone conversations with President Lee, had agreed that the U.S. and the ROK would intensify our defense cooperation and look across the spectrum of alliance operations, how we can do an even better job in deterring North Korea adventurism and in the defense of the ROK.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a number of measures that respective military commanders on both the U.S. and the ROK side are examining.\xc2\xa0 And those announcements -- any announcement is not ready to be made.<br/>\nI\xe2\x80\x99d come back, though, to the issue that Ambassador Bader raised earlier of the transfer of operational control, because in addition to the political and strategic aspects of that decision that he mentioned, there are also some considerable operational significance to it, as well.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The respective defense departments of our two governments have examined the question at the request of the ROK and come to the conclusion that this extension will strengthen the current transition plan, will allow us to synchronize more closely with the ROK\xe2\x80\x99s lead of the combined defense and that the result will be a more capable alliance.\xc2\xa0 So I think across the board what you will see in the short- and the midterm is a strengthening of the alliance transformation efforts to take into account the changes and evolution in the security situation in Northeast Asia.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 This is Ben Rhodes, I\xe2\x80\x99d just note that that was Danny Russel.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just add that in general the U.S.-Korean alliance is one that we believe is -- really is on as strong footing as has been in quite some time.\xc2\xa0 The depth of cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with President Lee and his government over the last year and a half is quite substantial and extends, of course, to economic issues.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But also in the political and security realm, we\xe2\x80\x99ve really been in lockstep with the Koreans.\xc2\xa0 And we view the delay in opcon as a significant step -- both, again, signaling the U.S. commitment to the region, which President Obama has made a key pillar of his foreign policy approach, as well as a key signal, particularly given the current state of play on the Korean Peninsula, about the depth of America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the alliance and to the stability and security of the region.\xc2\xa0 So I would just echo my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s comments and underscore the importance of the delay in opcon transfer and the full range of activities that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to deepen and strengthen this alliance.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 My question is also on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 China and Russia have been refusing to blame North Korea for the Cheonan attack, but Russia agreed to the wording of the G8 communique, so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you see this as a shift in their position?\xc2\xa0 And also did you get any assurance or indication from the Chinese President that China is going to support the action of the U.N. Security Council?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say something -- this is Ben Rhodes -- and turn it over to Ambassador Bader.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right to note that the G8 issued a strong statement today.\xc2\xa0 It was a condemnation of the sinking of the Cheonan and, again, a recognition of the investigation\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that North Korea was responsible for that sinking.\xc2\xa0 So the G8\xe2\x80\x99s condemnation was an important step forward in sending a signal from the international community, to include Russia, that North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s action was again unacceptable.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff may want to speak a little bit more about the state of play in New York and China.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR BADER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, all I\xe2\x80\x99d say on that is that the U.N. Security Council action is not yet complete, but there has been significant discussions in the last three or four days, including the Chinese, in which gaps have been closed.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re moving closer towards a satisfactory statement.\xc2\xa0 So we are not yet at the point where the G8 issued a statement -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not yet at that point in New York, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved in that direction.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
