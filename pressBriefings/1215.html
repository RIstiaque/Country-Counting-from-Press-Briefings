GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me -- I do have one quick scheduling announcement. \xc2\xa0Tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 p.m., the President will host Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Cantor and Majority Whip McCarthy for lunch here at the White House.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Open coverage? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve set out that many plates, Ms. Compton. \xc2\xa0But I know the President is looking forward to a productive lunch.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99d love to do it. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99d love to come. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re available.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will share that with the cooks.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I guess just quickly on that meeting, is there anything on the agenda that you can tell us about?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think that the President looks forward to discussing all issues foreign and domestic. \xc2\xa0Obviously, without a doubt, there will be I think a heavy discussion on the economy and on spending. \xc2\xa0And I think the President will have a chance to talk to -- through -- with them many of the things that he outlined in the State of the Union, and I have no doubt that they have their cares and concerns as well.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Will he be giving them any guidance on what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in his budget?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, we will save that for them and for you for Monday.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And just a few questions on Egypt. \xc2\xa0Is the President concerned that if Mubarak steps down ahead of September that that could undermine reforms in Egypt or hurt the chances of free and fair elections?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0If he -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, if he steps down --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If he steps down earlier than September.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, who leads Egypt and who leads Egypt when is a determination that can only be made by the Egyptians. \xc2\xa0What we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about throughout this process, and what I talked about extensively yesterday, was not about personalities but about a genuine and real process that leads us to those free and fair elections, a process that takes place without delay and produces immediate and irreversible results, progress for the people in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of things that they have to do along the way. \xc2\xa0The dialogue has to be real in order to produce that real change. \xc2\xa0I think, first and foremost, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about throughout this, the government has got to stop arresting protesters and journalists, harassment, beatings, detentions of reporters, of activists, of those involved in civil society. \xc2\xa0We would call on all of those prisoners, as we have, to be released immediately.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe that there has to be a process, that in this process that results in free and fair elections, that the emergency law be lifted, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about many times; that specific constitutional changes are made; and that we take concrete steps, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, to free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I will also add this. \xc2\xa0I think the rhetoric that we see coming out now that simply says that somehow what you see on TV has been drummed up by foreigners is at great odds with what we know is actually happening on the ground. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tSo I think that the process of who leads Egypt will be determined by Egyptians, but what we need to see now is continued progress by the Egyptian government to make these important real changes that demonstrate progress for the people.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But you have officials at the State Department who are saying that the chances of those changes being able to be enacted would be lessened if Mubarak resigned ahead of September.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I want to be clear. \xc2\xa0I speak for the President of the United States of America. \xc2\xa0We are not here to determine who leads Egypt and when they lead Egypt. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a -- that is a problem that only Egyptians can solve. \xc2\xa0As I said yesterday, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt there will be -- this is a -- this is not going to be an easy road. \xc2\xa0There will be bumps along the way. \xc2\xa0But it is important that the process that the government undergoes through negotiations with those that seek the representation that they deserve, that it be done in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s broadly inclusive.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not here to determine who leads Egypt. \xc2\xa0We are -- and I think the President was quite, quite clear -- the people of Egypt are not going back. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve moved forward and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to move forward, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see progress from their government.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And then just finally, has Vice President Biden spoken to Vice President Suleiman today?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me get a full readout. \xc2\xa0I do believe they have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when they spoke, precisely. \xc2\xa0I will try to determine that. \xc2\xa0But one of the messages that Vice President Biden and a whole host of government officials have delivered at all levels of the Egyptian government are many of the things that I outlined: \xc2\xa0stopping the beatings and harassment and detentions; the release of those that have been held or detained; the release of political prisoners; lifting the emergency law; concrete constitutional changes that need to take place and concrete steps that move us toward that free and fair election.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And as I said, most of all, I think the notion somehow that what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is drummed up by foreigners is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no evidence that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert, Egyptian Vice President Suleiman has said that there is a timetable for a peaceful transfer of power, and he said today that this process is on the right path. \xc2\xa0Is the President satisfied that the process is on the right path, or does he want to see something more tangible?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think less important is what we think and more important is what the people of Egypt think. \xc2\xa0There were certainly reports that those that are out protesting today exceed what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past several days. \xc2\xa0I think that is as good an answer for the Vice President of Egypt about the progress that the people in Egypt see and feel. \xc2\xa0It has to be tangible. \xc2\xa0It has to be real. \xc2\xa0It has to be immediate and irreversible.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yesterday I think the Vice President -- Vice President Suleiman made some particularly unhelpful comments about Egypt not being ready for democracy, about not seeing a lift of the emergency law. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be determined by -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be determined by the Egyptian people. \xc2\xa0Whether or not the government is taking those concrete steps can\xe2\x80\x99t be arbitrated by us. \xc2\xa0We can\xe2\x80\x99t do play-by-play on each and every step that they take. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be determined by the reaction in Cairo and throughout Egypt by the people.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But you certainly have a stake in that process going smoothly. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We have a stake in stability in Egypt, in regional stability. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been a cornerstone of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past three decades. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I said here on Friday and I think as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, the threat of instability -- and you see this again today with the swelling crowds -- the threat of instability is in not making that progress and in not letting the people in Egypt see that the steps that are being taken along that process are real, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that they can feel, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that will end in -- will end in free and fair elections based on a discussion that is had with a broad range of Egyptian society.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Just on one other topic briefly. \xc2\xa0On the proposal for the aid to states, are you concerned that critics may --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0On aid to states?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jobless aid to states -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Right, right, oh, I see.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0-- that the President is going to propose in the budget. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned that critics may call this a bailout for the states?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, in fact, in many ways it prevents in the future from having exactly to do that. \xc2\xa0Obviously some states have experienced even greater economic downturns than we have on average at a national level. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s put pressure on the unemployment insurance funds.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal does two things that are most important. \xc2\xa0It prevents increases in the federal tax that goes to the unemployment insurance fund, and that\xe2\x80\x99s tremendously important given where we are economically, but it prevents -- it prevents future state bailouts, because in the future, states are going to have to rationalize what they offer and how they pay for it.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are giving help to some states who have had to borrow and not been able yet to pay back, which would legally result in an increase in the federal share that has gotten through tax -- a tax on businesses, which we don\xe2\x80\x99t think makes any sense right now.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s, in states that are overdrawn on this, ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t place an extra burden on them. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s give them some time, in an economic downturn, to have what they need to effectively meet the needs of those that are unemployed and give them an understanding that in the future, as I said, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to rationalize what is offered and how they come up with the funds to pay for what is ultimately offered.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jake.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The protesters, according to accounts from reporters on the ground, the protesters in Egypt, feel the need to keep protesting because they feel even if the drips and drabs of reform announcements keep coming from the Egyptian government, they fear that if they stop protesting, opposition leaders will be targeted and the Egyptian government will clamp down. \xc2\xa0Does the administration agree with that?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Jake, that\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to -- as I said a minute ago, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of utility in our play-by-play of this. \xc2\xa0I think that the people that are expressing their desire for greater opportunity and freedom are going to continue to express that desire until the government takes the very concrete steps that I outlined a minute ago to address those concerns. \xc2\xa0And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, then those protests will, I assume, continue.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, I do think it is important -- and I said this at the very beginning, Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question, which is we -- and have said this, quite frankly, throughout -- the concerns that the people of Egypt have cannot, will not and should not be addressed through violence. \xc2\xa0It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be addressed through beatings and detentions and the like. \xc2\xa0And I think the pressure is only going to be lessened and the demands for greater freedom met through a concrete process.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the administration, even though obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re not dictating what Egypt needs to do, you have -- the government has offered guidance and suggestions as to what the Obama administration thinks would work well and what needs to happen, although you\xe2\x80\x99re not dictating anything, and one of those things, one of those suggestions, has been, you said from the podium, that transformation process, the transition process, cannot start in September. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tOthers in the administration have said that they have concerns about anything being rushed because you can\xe2\x80\x99t just go to a democracy in 60 days, and also fear that the Muslim Brotherhood would arise in the vacuum -- let me just ask the question -- which is, if we\xe2\x80\x99re saying two months is too soon, and September is too far, what exactly kind of timeline would the administration like, with the understanding that you\xe2\x80\x99re not dictating anything? \xc2\xa0What kind of suggestions are you making?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think we should understand a few things first, Jake, is that -- I guess -- I guess I would reject the notion of there just being two answers to this, right, in the sense that I think you have seen and heard the government of Egypt, as well as those seeking greater recognition and freedom -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve all acknowledged that there are some real and genuine constitutional changes that need to be made before we can have free and fair elections, right?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So right now, in order to qualify for the ballot, you go through a process of getting those in parliament, elections that we criticized, to basically sign up and bless your candidacy. \xc2\xa0Well, you can understand that those that are seeking greater freedom might not think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to get to free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think the notion that you either, that what you had, which is September or immediately in terms of all of these changes -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily the case. \xc2\xa0I think --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying. \xc2\xa0What are you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m asking what --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is there has to be a dynamic process to meet and address many of the concerns and the grievances, to set up a system where the world will watch an election that we all agree is free and fair. \xc2\xa0What timeline that takes I think is not for us to determine. \xc2\xa0But unless or until those that are seeking to have their grievances addressed -- until they believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening, the pressure is going to continue.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to advocate for a genuine process of negotiation to see this through.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And lastly, in his interview with ABC News, President Mubarak said that he told the President that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he understood -- that President Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand Egyptian culture. \xc2\xa0Did Mubarak say that, and what did President Obama say back?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read out what -- the specifics of the call. \xc2\xa0I think obviously the President and the administration have respect for what Egypt has accomplished over three decades and what President Mubarak has accomplished. \xc2\xa0But I think what is clear is what the President said -- has said over the past few days, that the people of Egypt have moved and they\xe2\x80\x99re not going back to what was.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As you track the progress on the ground in Egypt, what can you look at today that\xe2\x80\x99s different from yesterday for progress being made?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, Dan, I do not want to be the -- just as I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be the arbiter of what freedom of speech is in Egypt, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it makes sense for us to be the arbiter for whether today meant good progress or whether today was enough progress. \xc2\xa0I think that the world, quite frankly, understands what needs to happen.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve enumerated some ideas, many of which I just said, that would demonstrate to the Egyptian people that a process that is serious, immediate and irreversible is underway. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that must continue. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long road to go to get to free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the President yesterday talked about progress in those comments when he was walking, so --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what the President alluded to, and I think what many have alluded to, is the fact that there is the beginning of a process to do that. \xc2\xa0Okay? \xc2\xa0But setting up and having a process to do that is just part of it. \xc2\xa0Now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see some -- and you heard Vice President Biden say over the weekend in his readout that we need to understand what the arc of this is and we need to see, as the Egyptian people do -- most importantly -- need to see progress along that arc.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Has the President gone to his intelligence community and sort of pressured them to take a look at some other hotspots, perhaps, to see if something like what happened in Egypt could be at risk of breaking out in other countries?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, without getting in specifics on intelligence, obviously the intelligence community provides daily an update on what it sees happening in countries both in the Middle East and throughout the world.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But has the President applied more pressure now to say, hey, I need you to go and take a look at this in a much more focused way?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The premise of your question is somehow that that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already happened.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chip.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert, you said earlier that it\xe2\x80\x99s not about personalities, but then you specifically talked about Suleiman and said that he made some unhelpful comments. \xc2\xa0So if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a personality in there who is not helping and, in fact, may be hurting the process, it is about personalities, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? \xc2\xa0Is he the right person for this job?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, I think -- I want to say this. \xc2\xa0I think people have unnecessarily looked at what some people have said to believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve determined who should be the next leader of Egypt and when that leadership change should happen. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is -- the Vice President is -- I should say Vice President Suleiman -- is -- has been tasked with the process of including opposition groups, those in civil society who have not been represented in government, along this -- to institute a series of negotiations along this process to end in free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a process we support. \xc2\xa0That certainly has to happen. \xc2\xa0But the notion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve somehow laid hands on a particular person to lead Israel -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, to lead Egypt is just not the case.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid hands on them to lead, but you certainly could voice an opinion that he\xe2\x80\x99s not the right person to be in there if he\xe2\x80\x99s saying unhelpful things.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not -- well, look, I was pretty clear yesterday on what I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody in the world thinks represents progress. \xc2\xa0The process, though, Chip, can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we cannot determine every actor in that process, the timeline of every action in that process --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t determine it, but you can have opinions and say, we would prefer he not be there.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0And as I said a minute ago, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be the play-by-play announcer, and neither is this administration, for what represents progress in Egypt. \xc2\xa0Chip, we\xe2\x80\x99re just not -- the people in Egypt are not looking for anybody in this country to tell them what constitutes the meeting of those freedoms. \xc2\xa0Why would we think we could do that? \xc2\xa0Why would we think that we could determine who should be in charge of -- that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that is only something that can be determined by those that are in Egypt and those that are taking part in that process.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do think, Chip, that the world will know as -- and we will see it through the eyes of those who desire greater representation -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll know if progress is being made at a pace in which the Egyptian people believe it should be happening. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re all watching.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right that the Egyptian people and even the protesters understand --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Can you mark down he said he thought I was right?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Go ahead.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re right that the Egyptian people, the protesters --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0He said it again.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You were just so right.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s his last week. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You got to throw him a bone. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I can hardly wait to see what you say on Friday. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this one extraordinary instance, you\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such a handsome guy, also. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But he\xe2\x80\x99s not a play-by-play announcer. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I am not -- right. \xc2\xa0Somebody -- you guys -- so somebody can update the video, I am not a play-by-play commentator. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0It would be a good gig, let me tell you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The protesters say they understand the United States is not in a position to determine what happens here, but on the other hand, they are so deeply frustrated that the President says the right things about human rights and universal rights and freedom of speech and everything else, and then they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how he can then not demand that Mubarak and Suleiman get out of there, since they\xe2\x80\x99re the people who have implemented this oppressive system for so long.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But then, I guess the question would be -- I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d ask the question -- well, then, would you have us determine who that next person is? \xc2\xa0Would you have us determine what this council looks like that does this? \xc2\xa0Would you have us determine what that council can debate matches the definitions of freedom of access and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is not a task or a series of tasks that I think many in Egypt want us to do. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the cares and concerns of those that we see each day is going to be met by a process that is dictated by somebody else. \xc2\xa0It has to be a process that involves directly the Egyptian people.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And again, we will see based on what happens with those that continue to protest, whether the pace of what we understand -- we all understand needs to happen, what the government of Egypt has acknowledged needs to happen. \xc2\xa0We will all understand if the pacing meets the demands.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And real quickly, the lunch tomorrow, is that going to be a regular thing, a weekly thing?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a weekly thing. \xc2\xa0I know we had Senator McConnell in I think late last week. \xc2\xa0I think the President, as you heard him say at the beginning of the lame duck session, that we needed to do better to reach out and have those discussions, and I think this is certainly part of that.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And just the four of them in the room? \xc2\xa0The three Republicans and the President?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s as I understand it. \xc2\xa0And Ann of course. \xc2\xa0Go ahead. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert, is the President comfortable if Mubarak stays through September?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Mike, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many times I can say two things: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be the play-by-play commentators and that\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine. \xc2\xa0That<br/>\n\t\tis --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At one point last week, you said the transition needs to start yesterday --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I did.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the impression we all got, I think, was that Mubarak needed to go. \xc2\xa0So now I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get a sense of whether --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very, very clear and very, very consistent that we are not going to pick those leaders. \xc2\xa0We are not going to -- as I just said, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to define the membership in this process. \xc2\xa0The transition -- remember that the transition we will see throughout this process happened many, many times on the road to free and fair elections. \xc2\xa0And quite frankly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to do in that process. \xc2\xa0The fact that that transition has to start, as the President said, now, and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve repeated since, it\xe2\x80\x99s because many of the things that I outlined are going to require those discussions and those negotiations.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So it is -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not up for us to determine the personalities and who\xe2\x80\x99s going to lead and when they\xe2\x80\x99re going to lead and when they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to lead. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the job of the people of Egypt and that\xe2\x80\x99s the tough work that\xe2\x80\x99s involved in a democracy.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last crack at it. \xc2\xa0Does the White House believe the protests will stop as long as Mubarak is there?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think that you will continue to see those exercise their great desire to be recognized and to enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that they wish to -- I think you will continue to see that unless or until the process of an orderly transition that is broad-based begins to show immediate and irreversible change. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Egyptian people want and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the world is waiting for.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A quick follow-up based on the O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly interview. \xc2\xa0He said that he did not raise taxes. \xc2\xa0A taxpayer group says, in effect, he has raised taxes on a couple things; he\xe2\x80\x99s also cut taxes. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, do you guys disagree with that assessment?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen what the group has said. \xc2\xa0I would note that I think the Congressional Budget Office released figures yesterday that show that for the third consecutive year the American people are paying less in taxes than they did during the previous administration.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chuck.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that our policy towards Egypt is forever changed?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, we -- let me give you a broad answer to this, Chuck, because I think obviously we want to see the continued robust partnership that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, the stability in the region and around the world that that partnership has brought. \xc2\xa0I think Egypt has forever changed. \xc2\xa0I think that what the President said --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But not necessarily our policy yet?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- look, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into hypotheticals about what things look like in a year or in five years. \xc2\xa0But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that what the President said, that Egypt is not going backward, I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen transpire over the past 10 days has been nothing short of remarkable. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that anybody -- we have, other administrations have, called for the type of change that you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now -- it\xe2\x80\x99s happened in a very, very short period of time, but it is -- you look at the size and the scope of the announcements that have been made, it\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I ask I guess -- when does our policy change towards Yemen, towards Saudi Arabia, towards Jordan? \xc2\xa0When there\xe2\x80\x99s a groundswell like Egypt?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, no, I think -- no, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear because --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond what we say rhetorically.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0-- this was the case when -- when the President talked to the President of Egypt several weeks ago about what was happening in the Middle East, he reiterated that our calls for the government of Egypt to institute the type of reforms that we have long thought needed to be assumed.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I understand that, but we are now actively -- after there were protests --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, no, no --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0-- we as a -- as a U.S. government actively got involved in trying to push them across --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, no, no.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we didn\xe2\x80\x99t send Ambassador Wisner? \xc2\xa0I mean, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not sending an ambassador to the King of Jordan, right?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Hold on -- hold on, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve now generalized across the sweep of the entire Middle East, so let\xe2\x80\x99s try to get this -- let\xe2\x80\x99s go backwards just a tad.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen and in many of the countries that you discussed talked to them, as our administration and as previous administrations have, about greater access to freedom, greater access to freedom of speech, assembly -- all of those things.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our position on bringing democracy to the Middle East and bringing greater freedoms to those people didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t developed as a result of what happened in Tunisia or what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ambassador Wisner went for -- with a specific message and a specific conversation and to report back, okay? \xc2\xa0There were -- that was an instance that, based on the fact that we were seeing rapid change. \xc2\xa0But the broad notion of what we want to see happen in countries in the Middle East and throughout the world is shaped by the values with which we started our country.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I understand that, but what happened in Egypt spurred us -- spurred your administration, the administration to get more active in the situation in Egypt. \xc2\xa0Is that now going to forever change? \xc2\xa0Is the administration planning to get more active in Yemen, planning to get more active in Saudi Arabia --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0-- planning to get more active in Jordan? \xc2\xa0Or is this just you wait for a groundswell?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re generalizing broadly. \xc2\xa0Obviously we have a team that is -- that monitors and works through a whole host of bilateral relationships because many of the countries that you just mentioned, we have very important relationships with.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And look, as events dictate, we will respond to them. \xc2\xa0I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to generalize across countries --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that that is --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0-- something would have to happen before we\xe2\x80\x99d change our policies in another country?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well -- no, no, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, I have throughout this -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken about our universal values, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to generalize across a platform of countries that, again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, may be at different stages in their own political development.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Earlier today you guys sent out basically I guess a position on -- you want Congress to re-enact, to continue the powers that you have with the FISA courts and some of these intelligence -- some of the parts of the -- how do you assure supporters of yours who didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision in 2008 when he voted for these changes in the law that gave these expansive powers, how do you assure them that they\xe2\x80\x99re not being abused?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, first and foremost, the reason --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0-- to monitor this?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s FISA courts to do that, and I think -- look, there were -- this was a debate that happened in \xe2\x80\x9805 and \xe2\x80\x9806 and \xe2\x80\x9807 and even in \xe2\x80\x9808 that -- look, there were some that wanted to do away with FISA warrants and the court system that -- and as the President said, it is important that we have a mechanism that watches the watchers. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s -- that is in this instance an important aspect of what the judicial branch does.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I understand the process. \xc2\xa0When does the public -- I mean at some point do you allow sort of -- some sort of scrutiny on this outside of the FISA court?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- again, the role in government to do that is through a very specialized set of developed courts in order to ensure that what is done meets the law.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And you want new changes in the law at this point --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I think it -- obviously this is -- there are important activities that need to be reauthorized, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where our focus is now.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Very quickly, has the President voted yet in Chicago?*<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The President requested, as the First Lady did, requested an absentee ballot. \xc2\xa0I do not know if that has been filled out, but I can put that on the list.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Laura.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the unemployment insurance proposal, are you at all concerned that this is going to be read as an increased tax on business at a time when the administration is working hard to mend its relationship with the business community?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, because, look, this specifically -- this policy, if enacted, would prevent further federal tax increases, would help states make up for the shortfalls they have and give them time, as I said, to rationalize what they offer and how they pay for it.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, you have in 2011 and 2012 and parts of 2013 the ability to make the type of structural changes that a state would need to make in order to ensure that, again, what they offer and how they pay for it, that that\xe2\x80\x99s met up so that we can do this responsibly.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you think that the states are going to take up the opportunity to increase the tax?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think what you have to -- what we think has to happen in those out-years is that you cannot continue to offer something at a state level, right, that is not ultimately supported by the base with which you\xe2\x80\x99re funding it, right? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Look, those are the discussions that are happening at -- have happened for many years at the state level. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re happening now at the federal level in terms of getting our fiscal house in order. \xc2\xa0I think that whether it happens at the federal level or the state level, we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we have to make some tough decisions about ensuring that we can pay for what we\xe2\x80\x99re offering.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And just one other issue. \xc2\xa0How does that -- in terms of the announcement from the Vice President today about the rail investment, how would you pay for that?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That will be in the budget on Monday.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert, thank you. \xc2\xa0Back in 1979, President Carter was criticized for allowing the Shah to come here for medical treatment. \xc2\xa0If it came to the point where Mubarak had to flee, would the U.S. allow him to come here?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think getting into that sort of hypothetical at this point doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Also real quickly, your comments on the CBO report, didn\xe2\x80\x99t the report actually say that Americans aren\xe2\x80\x99t paying so much less in taxes but tax receipts are down because so many people have been laid off? \xc2\xa0Would you like to clarify your --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the report.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert, is it accurate to say that the administration has extended its -- for want of a better expression -- expectation timetable for change in Egypt?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think that -- I think it is accurate to say that Vice President Biden, in discussions with Vice President Suleiman and discussions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had government-to-government -- we want to understand that they have a timetable to make change, yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what would you say to someone in Egypt who -- especially people on the streets who\xe2\x80\x99ve told reporters that they think that the pressure from the United States for change is easing up after hearing some of the things that have been said the past couple of days?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll listen to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said \xc2\xa0-- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s any -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve eased up in any way. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think what the President has said has in any way eased up on what we need to see.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I said that the transition should begin yesterday when I was asked the day after the President spoke and the day after President Mubarak spoke. \xc2\xa0And I think, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to see pressure within the people of Egypt unless or until the process makes those type of changes.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think that we have enumerated the universal values that we believe everyone should have, and I think we have been clear in making sure that the government of Egypt understands that they have to take those concrete steps.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where do things stand on the aid review?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No different than when I mentioned it I think a couple of Fridays ago, which is we will monitor the actions in response to what is happening in Cairo and in Egypt and make determinations as to whether that would affect our aid. \xc2\xa0And that -- we continue to monitor that.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the unemployment insurance aid to states, is that the primary way that the administration sees the federal government aiding states with their fiscal situations?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, this was obviously a particular situation because, as Laura mentioned in her question, if you -- if states are borrowing off of a UI account, not able to pay that back, then the law says that the rate has to increase at a federal share on businesses. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t think that makes sense right now. \xc2\xa0We think that we ought to make sure that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, that states have a chance to rationalize, again, what they offer, and that in the meantime we\xe2\x80\x99re helping other states that might fall into things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Michigan, in South Carolina and Indiana, with that fund.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Could we expect other proposals in the budget that would go toward helping states with their fiscal --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t preview the budget.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And also, does the administration consider the fiscal situation that states are facing to be in crisis category yet?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that without getting into a specific word or series of words, obviously I think in each stage of -- or each year that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in office, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen tremendous shortfalls. \xc2\xa0Obviously there are a number of states that are experiencing particularly acute shortfalls. \xc2\xa0And that has an impact on the economy.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the lunch tomorrow, talk about the thinking behind having just House Republicans as opposed to House and Senate or Republican and Democratic leadership.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think the President will take an opportunity to see and to meet with a whole host of different leadership entities and things like that. \xc2\xa0As I said, I think it was Friday that Senator McConnell was here to have lunch with the President. \xc2\xa0So I think over the course of the next many weeks you\xe2\x80\x99ll see folks in here to see the President and the administration as we move forward.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is there a sense that he can get more done if it\xe2\x80\x99s just Republicans as opposed to the Republican and Democratic clash that might come from having leaders of both parties there?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that, again, I go back to draw on what the President said in December -- or I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember if it\xe2\x80\x99s December or November at this point now -- late last year that he needed to do a better job of reaching out. \xc2\xa0And I think hearing what their concerns are and, quite frankly, understanding that the House Republicans now play the important role of governing House -- governing half of the legislative branch. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re going to be -- they\xe2\x80\x99re involved in the responsibility of governing, and I think an exchange of ideas on the issues that we face are important.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And on a different issue, since this is your last week, do you have advice for your successor that you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to share with us?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0We have had many private conversations about that.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Connie.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One domestic and one international. \xc2\xa0If Israel is threatened by any of these new governments or by Hamas or Hezbollah, if its existence is in danger, would the U.S. come to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s assistance?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think regardless of the situation facing any government in the region, our friendship and our -- our friendship, our partnership and our alliance with Israel is unchanged.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And on this Washington Post story about the wealthy taking up arms in the District -- a very interesting story. \xc2\xa0What does that say about the level of confidence of the American people in a criminal situation?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I read a lot this morning but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I read that one.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If you could look at that and --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Back to Vice President Suleiman. \xc2\xa0I just want to be clear about the call that the Vice President I gather made. \xc2\xa0Did the administration see Suleiman\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say something about this? \xc2\xa0Was it to object to that?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I objected to and said that I thought what he said yesterday was unacceptable in this process.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is that what prompted the call?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no. \xc2\xa0Again, I think that -- as we talked about yesterday, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a counterpart-to-counterpart relationship with Vice President Biden and Vice President Suleiman as a continued channel to discuss the process and the pathway to free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On that process, one of the criticisms that\xe2\x80\x99s been made of it is that it has not been terribly inclusive at this point, that a very small subset of the opposition is involved. \xc2\xa0Has that point been made to the Egyptians?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It has. \xc2\xa0It has -- both privately and publicly. \xc2\xa0Again, unless or until there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad base of those that are not currently represented in government, unless or until those are involved in this process, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the reaction that you see from the people of Egypt. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One other thing, if I may. \xc2\xa0There have been reports that the three-way meeting -- American, Pakistani and Afghan foreign ministers -- is now in some question because of the continued detention of the U.S. diplomat in Pakistan. \xc2\xa0Is that true?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me -- I think State has got better details on that and I\xe2\x80\x99d point you over there.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ann.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert. \xc2\xa0As you wind down here, have you given any advice to your successor on press policy, on access? \xc2\xa0And do you have any regrets about --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I should probably take all these questions. \xc2\xa0Do I have any regrets about --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Do you have thoughts about things that have gone on the last two years that you wish had gone better?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Oh, let me tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to answer for you all and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to answer for anybody in the country, but I think if you do a job for a specific amount of time and look back and say you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done anything differently, you probably haven\xe2\x80\x99t spent a lot of time thinking back about what you did. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tI mean, look, I take my transcript home every night and I read my transcript. \xc2\xa0And I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s a time in which I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that transcript that I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought, wow, perfect, I did it all just right -- I mean, it may happen on Thursday night -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t brief that day -- (laughter) -- but I mean the notion that somehow you don\xe2\x80\x99t look back and think you would have done things differently -- look, I will have quite a bit of time to more aptly focus on it.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tI will say -- look, I think -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back to Ari because I avoided doing this and you repeated his question almost verbatim and I swallowed the hook -- (laughter) -- so, look, I think you have to have -- we discuss in pretty broad detail and in great depths the situation that\xe2\x80\x99s transpiring thousands of miles away. \xc2\xa0This is -- when things like that happen it\xe2\x80\x99s more than just -- this is more than just a conversation that is happening between this side of the room and this side of the room. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s happening and people are watching it not just throughout this country but throughout this world. \xc2\xa0And your questions and my answers are being translated in languages that are spoken in continents far away. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tI think it demonstrates the importance of a strong freedom of the press, a sharing of information. \xc2\xa0I think the reason that we can speak about the universal values that we hold so dear, and we can speak about it halfway across the world, is because it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we think is so tremendously important.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Have you given advice to your successor?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That was Ari\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0We have talked a lot about -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to share that advice. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let that counsel remain private. \xc2\xa0But Jay and I have talked a lot about the importance of this job. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that as a personal thing. \xc2\xa0I mean this will long outlive -- in a country like this, it will long outlive the personality of myself, just as it long outlived the personalities that came before me and will long outlive who comes next.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Have you written your note for the flak jacket yet?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to share that --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert, there was a -- based on what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying here today, there was a story in The New York Times a few days ago that said that the United States was involved in discussions with the Egyptians to have Mubarak turn over power immediately. \xc2\xa0Is that story incorrect?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into conversations that are had between our government and --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear that the United States is not supposed to be getting into when Mubarak should leave and suggested very strongly that we have not tried to get him out immediately. \xc2\xa0Have discussions like that taken place where we are pressuring him to get out?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I am not going to get into the details of every conversation that is had with our government and other foreign governments. \xc2\xa0But I want to be clear that these are decisions that can, and can only, be made by the Egyptians.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the United States has not tried to remove Mubarak from power right away?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Keith, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many times I can answer the same question --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not answering it.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I am. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re just not accepting my answer.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0One other quick question. \xc2\xa0You talk a lot about what the Egyptian people want, and I think everybody would agree that the Mubarak regime is a repressive regime, and we do know that there have been a lot of very passionate people out in Tahrir Square. \xc2\xa0But how do we actually know what the Egyptian people want?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well -- but, see, Keith, that is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why would don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re not the ones who are checking off on what the process has to be. \xc2\xa0Again, as I said --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But you quote what the Egyptian people want several times already in this briefing. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is -- and they may want exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, but how do we know what -- why people --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- I mean, I think the reason that you can ask me questions about why the Egyptian people don\xe2\x80\x99t think they have greater freedoms is because those freedoms are enumerated in many of the stories that I read around -- from different outlets around this room. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s written on signs in Tahrir Square. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s held up by people -- but again, Keith, I think what is --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You could get people out on the Mall with lots of signs; that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the majority of American people support whatever they\xe2\x80\x99re out there for.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Keith, you are enumerating far better than I could why it is not for us to arbitrate. \xc2\xa0Now, if somebody holds a sign up on the Washington Mall, it may not constitute the majority of opinion in this country but it probably constitutes the majority of the opinion that that person holds. \xc2\xa0And guess what. \xc2\xa0This is a great and exciting country that allows anybody to walk out on the Mall with a sign that expresses their viewpoint.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tBut that is -- what you are saying is the exact reason why our government isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to determine the definition of individual or group freedoms in a country like Egypt. \xc2\xa0We can talk about the universal values of free speech, of freedom of assembly, freedom to communicate across the Internet or social networking, but it is not up to -- and it should not be up to our government or some entity in our government to determine what the scope of freedom of speech looks like in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is for the precise reason that we give the answer that this is up to Egyptians. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not a way of just simply saying that phrase over and over again. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99re not just saying that -- you\xe2\x80\x99re insisting on them doing certain things, and you\xe2\x80\x99re justifying it based on the will of the Egyptian people. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say it many times. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not just --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Keith, Keith --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a totally hands-off process.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Keith --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Keith, I think you should just go get any newspaper or turn on any television set inside of this building and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see many -- do I know every person\xe2\x80\x99s concern in Egypt? \xc2\xa0I will go way out on this limb and say, I do not. \xc2\xa0But again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have to have -- you could pull up your rabbit ears and figure out what people are concerned about in Cairo because it\xe2\x80\x99s all over the TV.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Go ahead.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have just a question about Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s meeting here last week. \xc2\xa0Was it just the President and the Senator?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It was just the two of them.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And what did they discuss?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Same thing I think that I talked about that I think will be discussed in their lunch tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Did the President have any Democratic leaders over last week at the White House?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I will double-check.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0April.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert -- thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0On the issue of the meeting and finding common ground and civility, realistically how long does this administration think that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to have civility and finding common ground, this whole era of that right now, as we\xe2\x80\x99re walking into presidential campaigns and things of that nature?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many months the presidential campaign is away, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a long way away.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And, April, there are important things that have to happen in Congress and around the country to meet the concerns and to meet the problems that we face, the challenges that we have that are required that we take action on well in advance of the calendar of a presidential election.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is posturing right now on the --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what happens in this town. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what -- but, again, I think the clear message from the American people in the election was that they don\xe2\x80\x99t need that, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want that. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re looking for two parties to be able to sit down and have those conversations and work out answers to those problems.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think it will -- it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s required. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not what may happen.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, also I asked you last week about the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in Rahm Emanuel\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, let me -- I will ask -- I will see if I have any update on that after -- if I find out if the President and the First Lady have voted.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I want to ask -- I want to ask you something about your departure. \xc2\xa0You consciously made a decision to leave. \xc2\xa0But from day one you have enjoyed that podium -- beyond the professionalism --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said a hundred times, well, probably 10,000 times, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy some element of this, you\xe2\x80\x99d do it for about three days, and you would turn in your pass and hope no one ever found you again. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mean, the truth is -- if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have some enjoyment in --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the way, should we be judging you on that negatively that you enjoy this? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I assume you do, too. \xc2\xa0Well, some of you have contracts that require you to sit in these seats. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there\xe2\x80\x99s no gray area -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no gray area.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no. \xc2\xa0Look, again, I think -- look, first of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to turn this into my fond farewell.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the least favorite topic I have, which is me.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s about you.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is -- like I said, I think if you were to have somebody in this job that didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy doing this job, like I said, it is one of the most challenging jobs I think that is had in all of this government for the precise reason of we\xe2\x80\x99re up here talking about a subject that can influence what happens 10 miles and 10,000 miles away.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have some enjoyment in doing this job, like I said, it would compound how -- you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it long.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s some skepticism about the President\xe2\x80\x99s call for corporate tax reform because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t produced key specifics, like what the rates should be, what the treatment of foreign taxes should be, what is the difference between a preference and a loophole. \xc2\xa0It isn\xe2\x80\x99t really -- how long do we have to wait for the specifics of his plan?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that this is not going to be we put out a plan, we say, hey, this is our plan, take this or leave this. \xc2\xa0I think the President started a series of discussions about this with business leaders at the Blair House. \xc2\xa0Those conversations -- and with Secretary Geithner -- have continued to happen. \xc2\xa0This is a process that is not going to -- not going to take a matter of days or weeks; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take months if not years. \xc2\xa0So I think this is a long process that will involve stakeholders at all levels with both political parties weighing in on their ideas about how we meet the goal of reforming the way corporate taxes are done, lowering that rate, but keeping it deficit neutral.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I have two questions.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Going back on Egypt. \xc2\xa0You said many times that you credited the Egyptian army. \xc2\xa0Considering the history of the Middle East, many of the current and previous leaders came from in the military coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat. \xc2\xa0Three of them are in charge of the transition now in Egypt -- Suleiman, Shafik and Tantawi are military men. \xc2\xa0Do you really trust them they will lead the transition to free and fair election?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, two things. \xc2\xa0One, I think we have rightly, I think, given some praise to the actions that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been taken, that many feared might be taken with an army deployed and hundreds of thousands if not millions of protestors. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, also, that we have -- we talked about today and we have talked about this previously, about continued restraint and adherence to nonviolence and assurance that anything involving harassment or beating or detention is ended immediately.<br/>\n\t\tSo we will continue to watch, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said throughout this, the process of their reaction. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tSecondly, again, I think the determination about the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made toward free and fair elections will be determined by those in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can I follow up on that?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0I just want to go --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0She has one more and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0-- to the second question, which is the British Foreign Minister William Hague said today that this is time for the U.S. administration to take a bold step in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process considering what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0Is this something that the President is considering now?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think the President has, and this administration have been, from day one, actively involved in seeking a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0And we understand and we know that our lack of involvement by this country is not likely to produce the outcome that the world hopes for with peace. \xc2\xa0Only through active engagement and involvement can that happen. \xc2\xa0We have and we will continue to do that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tBut just like in this instance, we cannot construct or force on those two entities something that they\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to take steps to do themselves. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert. \xc2\xa0You started off by calling for the arrest of journalists to stop, and our own reporting shows that the military police was involved. \xc2\xa0Do you still think the Egyptian military showed professionalism, impartiality and restraint?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I would refer you to what I said a second ago, which is obviously the restraint that we saw in Tahrir has been important. \xc2\xa0Without getting into who may or may not be involved, any involvement -- look, the government of Egypt has a strict responsibility to its citizens to assure their safety and security, to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to exercise their right to protest in a peaceful way.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that goes for foreign journalists who are there to cover that story. \xc2\xa0I watched yesterday a couple of interviews with two journalists from FOX that -- I mean, the pictures were hard to watch, the after-effect several days later of whomever that was, beating, detaining, harassing those reporters -- and that has to stop regardless of who is either in charge of or involved in that.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sam.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Robert, can you just tell us real quickly why the meeting -- why the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with McConnell wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the public schedule?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been talk on the Hill about reopening up the individual mandate in health care legislation. \xc2\xa0How firm is the President and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to that provision considering that at one point in time, he was not supportive of it?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Sam, we -- look, we -- the President had to make a conscious decision about how to ensure that the legislation would prevent the problem that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with free riders; in other words, people that never think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get sick and don\xe2\x80\x99t get sick, but they get hit by a bus and show up at the emergency room, and then they charge us basically to pay for it.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The protections that we will have as part of this law that are derived from ensuring that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a certain segment of the population that\xe2\x80\x99s covered but that everybody has coverage is an important foundation in this law.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President supports it. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to court to maintain it. \xc2\xa0And as the President has said, we will work with those who want to see improvements in this law regardless of policy -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, regardless of party. \xc2\xa0But we believe that individual responsibility is a foundation for this.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Have you not seen another provision that can do what that provision does?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think if we thought there was a better way of doing it, we would have done it that way.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0George.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I just wanted to follow on Abby\xe2\x80\x99s question on the topics that came up with Senator McConnell.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me see if I can get --<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s one -- well, but there\xe2\x80\x99s one topic that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with the House leaders. \xc2\xa0Did the President raise the issues of judicial confirmations? \xc2\xa0And are we going to see any further push by the President on confirmations?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me go check on that right now.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert. \xc2\xa0Back to Egypt, has there been a certain amount of soul-searching and reevaluation in the administration about how to deal with undemocratic governments that are nonetheless helpful to the United States?<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, we have important -- as I said earlier, important bilateral relationships throughout the world. \xc2\xa0We cannot institute or force change on any of those governments. \xc2\xa0We can speak out directly, privately and in public on the universal values that we support. \xc2\xa0And I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say and I think what my guess is governments throughout the world are seeing is that what happens in a country when a government appears not to be responsive to the needs of, the concerns of, its citizens. \xc2\xa0And I think as the President has said, each and every one in government has the responsibility to do that.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Savannah.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We just had a wire cross that said the First Lady said the President has now quit smoking and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t smoked in almost a year. \xc2\xa0Just wonder if you know anything more about that.<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.
