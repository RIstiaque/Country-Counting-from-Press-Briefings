Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t2:05 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the meeting with the Republican leadership and something on Egypt, too, please.\xc2\xa0 So Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Cantor essentially both said that there was agreement at the lunch on the need the cut spending and on the need to do it together with the President.\xc2\xa0 Is that how the President sees it as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I just came from talking to him about the lunch.\xc2\xa0 He thought it was very constructive; that they agreed on -- expand a little bit -- on cutting spending and reducing our deficit; that we should have a broad discussion about, with the American people, the size and the scope of the problem that we face in getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 They discussed issues like trade as areas where we could work together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously our Trade Representative testified on the House side today, saying that the administration would soon send up the language around the South Korea free trade agreement and intensify our engagement to address both Colombia and Panama in hopes that those negotiations could be concluded this year and agreements could then be sent to Congress thereafter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They agreed that education, an issue that we have worked on in a bipartisan way over the first two years of the administration, continues to be one where Democrats and Republicans can and should work together.\xc2\xa0 Regulations that are outdated and don\'t work was another topic.\xc2\xa0 They also talked some about foreign policy, particularly managing the transitions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I would say obviously reducing the deficit and growing the economy were the things that, according to the President, were most discussed at the lunch.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the area of spending and the deficit, did the Republican leadership and the President reach and specific agreement on anything?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- not that I\'m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Was that something that was ever part of the agenda for this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, this is -- look, I think this is going to be a long discussion on the steps that we need to take to reduce our deficit, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that people looked at this as a negotiating session.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While that was happening or earlier, the House Republicans spelled out some proposed spending cuts, some $35 billion worth, including areas such as high-speed rail and education that the President obviously wants to invest more money in, and in some cases conservatives want even bigger cuts.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I know that not long ago we saw parts of that list.\xc2\xa0 I know OMB is taking a look at that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s broad agreement that we have to change the way Washington works, particularly as it relates to spending.\xc2\xa0 We have to do so in a way that protects important investments so that we can win the future.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President looks forward to working with Republicans and other Democrats to make progress on these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on Egypt, please.\xc2\xa0 The Israeli Defense Minister is coming here later today to meet with Mr. Donilon and Secretaries Clinton and Gates.\xc2\xa0 Can you say what the mission of that meeting is and whether you think the President might stop by?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to the latter question.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s in town for some regularly scheduled meetings.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout on some of those discussion afterwards.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that you think he will be pushing the message about concerns of Mubarak stepping down too quickly?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not going to presume what somebody from another government might say to us.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not my role.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on the Republican leadership meeting, and the other on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 What, if any, specific areas of spending cuts did they discuss in this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me details on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the President at any point ask the Republicans not to use as a political football the threat to not lift the national debt ceiling, which Republicans said they weren\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that level of detail from him.\xc2\xa0 I think our position on that is fairly well known.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on Egypt, the Egyptian Foreign Minister is telling PBS that Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s call for immediate lifting of the emergency law in Egypt was -- he was amazed by that, and he felt that the Egyptian government could not make such a move until the unrest had been put down and calm had been restored.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the readout of the Vice President -- from Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s call to Vice President Suleiman -- that an orderly transition must begin now, that it must produce without delay immediate and irreversible progress.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is clear that what the government has thus far put forward has yet to meet a minimum threshold for the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why many of you reported the crowds in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s protests were bigger than even those on Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we were all, and have been, struck here at the diversity of those that you saw in the street yesterday -- diversity of age, diversity of lifestyle, diversity of ideas.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is clear that the Egyptian government is going to have to take some real concrete steps in order to meet the threshold that the people of Egypt that they represent require from their government.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think unless, or until that progress takes hold, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the continued pictures that all of us are watching out of Cairo and of over cities throughout Egypt.\xc2\xa0 So I think the best way to do that is for Vice President Suleiman, as the head of this process representing the Egyptian government -- is to expand the size and scope of the discussions and the negotiations with those that are not in power, and to take many of the steps that we outlined yesterday, one of which is lifting the emergency law.\xc2\xa0 One of them is -- are constitutional changes so that we get toward free and fair elections.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that they have yet to meet the threshold that will satisfy most of the people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has anybody in the Obama administration reached out for consultations or discussions at all with anybody in the leading opposition group in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of your readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the House Republican leaders, you said -- you made a reference to intensifying our engagement in the Colombia and Panama free trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans say those free trade agreements are good to go, send them up, we\xe2\x80\x99ll vote for them.\xc2\xa0 What do you mean when you say \xe2\x80\x9cintensifying our engagement\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are some -- and as Ambassador Kirk said today, there are some outstanding issues -- look, these free trade agreements have been -- haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone anywhere in Congress because there continue to be some outstanding issues particularly around internationally recognized labor rights that I think many believe must be addressed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the model that we used for South Korea is one that Ambassador Kirk and the President believe can result in an agreement that will capture broad bipartisan support, hopefully as soon as we can get some of this worked out.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\'t -- there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be -- once the agreement gets done on South Korea, I don\'t expect that there would be a lot of delay in getting that done.\xc2\xa0 We had again outstanding issues as it related to South Korea, particularly on autos and beef.\xc2\xa0 We worked that out and stakeholders from both sides of the political spectrum, business and labor are now endorsing that free trade agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do they need to be renegotiated, Colombia and Panama?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We need to address some outstanding issues like we did with South Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but with South Korea you renegotiated the deal, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we addressed outstanding issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what that means?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are issues that need to be addressed, and that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do address them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what that means when you say you have issues that need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a trade agreement -- you renegotiated with the South Korea government is what you did.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we -- there were shortcomings in what needed to be addressed on issues relating to autos and beef, which had prevented an agreement from being voted on.\xc2\xa0 There are, as I said in my earlier answer to you, outstanding issues relating to Colombia and Panama that also need to be addressed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to say that Vice President Suleiman\xe2\x80\x99s vision for the transition process is not entirely in line with the U.S. position?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that his -- the process for his transition does not appear to be in line with the people of Egypt, and I think we believe that more has to be done and I think, more importantly, the people of Egypt think more has to be done.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why you continue to see the size of those gathered to express their concerns about their lack of recognition and freedom and opportunity -- why those ranks continue to grow.\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President was clear with Vice President Suleiman on some steps that needed to be taken to address the concerns that we see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the White House still confident that he\xe2\x80\x99s the right person for the job?\xc2\xa0 I know over the weekend there were a lot of positive comments made by this administration about sort of support for him and what he was doing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- again, Vice President Suleiman -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve done this about four times but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try one more time.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Suleiman is in charge of a process in representing the Egyptian government to negotiate with those not in government in order to get us on a path toward an orderly transition that ends in a free and fair election.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of that process with the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine who sits in a room representing the opposition -- except for us to understand that when unrest grows and the size of these crowds grow, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the threshold of meeting a broad-based coalition in -- that represents a broad-based coalition of civil society, that that\'s not been reached.\xc2\xa0 I think that is what continues to be the problem.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s not for you to decide, then why, then, is the Vice President -- we saw strong language from the Vice President essentially putting pressure and offering up some demands, some things that need to be changed.\xc2\xa0 So, clearly, there is a position.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s something that you want to be done in Egypt, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 More importantly, Dan, there\xe2\x80\x99s something the people of Egypt want to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the administration does as well.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the people in Egypt --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 True --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s what the White House wants to happen there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what I think everybody in the international community understands has to be done to meet the demands of those that are protesting in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious -- you\'re reporting it, what people are looking for.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve talked about lifting the emergency law for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 We put out a statement last year at its extension that, going backwards almost three decades, this was not something that we thought was in any way helpful.\xc2\xa0 That happened -- you see people believing that that should be rescinded just like we do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, it is not for us to determine the outcome.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine all of those participants.\xc2\xa0 The participants on the government side are -- is Vice President Suleiman.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the Vice President of our country has talked to him about broadening this process, quickening the pace of this process.\xc2\xa0 Because, again, what we see happening on the streets of Cairo is not altogether surprising when you understand the lack of steps that the government has taken to address their concerns. I mean, I think that\'s what we see happening.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that it has a full understanding of all of those participants and what their motives are?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine, Dan.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to pick which seven people represent Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying pick them.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying do you have an understanding --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, you are, Dan.\xc2\xa0 In fact, you are.\xc2\xa0 That was inherent in your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, what I said was do you think that you have a full understanding of all of these players and what their motives are.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying whether or not you\'re supporting them or picking them.\xc2\xa0 Do you think you have a good understanding of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, this is something for the Egyptians to work out.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think what you saw yesterday was a very broad coalition -- represented a very broad coalition of grievances and concerns by the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 Again, one of them -- I think somebody that stirred a lot of passion yesterday was somebody who works for a Silicon Valley company.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, that there is a broad array of -- you saw families, you saw older people bring their children.\xc2\xa0 You say -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad cross-section of Egyptian society that seeks the types of freedoms that many have sought for quite some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the government is going to have to be responsive to those concerns.\xc2\xa0 And if not, you\'re going to see, as I think everyone anticipates, the size of these protests, certainly as we get to Friday, get bigger and bigger.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about Suleiman, but I just want to -- some of his quotes recently are that there will be no ending of -- yesterday and today -- \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no ending of the regime.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely do not tolerate it\xe2\x80\x9d -- meaning the civil disobedience.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot bear this situation for a long time and we must end this crisis as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 People on the ground there say they think what he\xe2\x80\x99s threatening is a violent crackdown if these protests don\'t end.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, first and foremost, we would reiterate, and we have at every discussion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had at all levels with Egyptian government, that the demands of those protesting cannot be addressed with violence, and should not.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think, Chip, if you layer what the government of Egypt is saying, if you put that on one side of the ledger, and then on the other side of the ledger you put a growing number of people out seeking redress of those grievances, then you understand that what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying is not assuaging the concerns of those in protest.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do more; it\xe2\x80\x99s clear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why some on the Hill today, some former State Department officials said it\xe2\x80\x99s conceivable we\xe2\x80\x99re moving toward a Tiananmen Square situation, because the rhetoric is -- the tough rhetoric is increasing from Suleiman, in spite of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s call --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and the protesters are getting tougher on their side by increasing the size of the crowd and having stronger statements about Mubarak having to go.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody -- I do not think anybody believes and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody wants on our -- in this government that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for their government.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a spokesperson for their government, Chip.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- I think our strong belief is that the process -- again, I think if the process is expanded, if a broader group of those not in government take part in this process -- it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the government is going to have to do some changing, some immediate and some irreversible change.\xc2\xa0 And I think --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That could mean a crackdown in the eyes of Suleiman.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Chip, I would simply reiterate as we have said from the very outset of this that it is our -- we strongly condemn any violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 That is not in any way going to meet the concerns of those that you see in the streets.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your message today is very consistent with yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I try.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but first Vice President Biden had that call and put out the press release yesterday in which he said that he had called on Suleiman to end the arrests and the harassments and the beating, immediately rescind the emergency law, broaden participation in the dialogue and invite the opposition to participate in discussions on -- but if anything, from his statements of yesterday and today, he\xe2\x80\x99s moving in the opposite direction.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time for the White House to ratchet up the pressure, do something?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the crowds are getting bigger.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about the White House response?\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you need to do X, Y and Z, and he\xe2\x80\x99s moving in the opposite direction, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House need to do something else?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what -- the White House can do only -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not in charge of, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to force them to do anything.\xc2\xa0 But I think if Vice President Suleiman continues to pepper his statements with -- as he had two days before and Sheryl asked me about, that we\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to move toward democracy, not going to see anything change -- it is clear, as the President has said, that Egypt is not going back to where it was.\xc2\xa0 Nobody believes that.\xc2\xa0 And unless or until the government broadens the negotiations with those in the opposition, unless or until that happens, the pressure for them to do so is only going to get greater.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s some notion on the government\xe2\x80\x99s side that you can put the genie back in this bottle, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s gone a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 And, quite frankly, we saw, Chip, what happened in the middle of last week when violence was entered into this equation, which is why the Prime Minister came out the next day and talked about what a fatal error that had been.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- nobody here believes that the grievances are going to be met with a violent -- that the grievances will be dealt with through a violent response in a way that helps move toward change.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is -- has the administration said to Suleiman that if there is violence again then we will cut the aid package?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been clear from the beginning of this that we will evaluate their responses to -- and their level of restraint will be evaluated as we make decisions on our aid.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on the aid, it\xe2\x80\x99s still the same answer as it was two weeks ago?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are watching quite closely to see what those responses are, and the response of the government will determine what that aid looks like.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a timetable for getting these free trade deals done?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, I think Ambassador Kirk said today that our hope is to get South Korea done in the first -- through Congress in the first half of this year.\xc2\xa0 And it is our hope that we can resolve outstanding issues with Colombia and Panama this year and then move language to the Hill soon thereafter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on Senator Webb\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of retirement and impact it may have on 2012?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President had an opportunity to talk with Senator Webb earlier in the morning and thanked him for, yet again, for the service that he has displayed on behalf of his country.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the impacts that he\xe2\x80\x99s had on things like veterans through a post-9/11 GI Bill represent his mark on this country and the people that have served it.\xc2\xa0 I think Virginia is going to be a very competitive state in -- as it was last time in both presidential and Senate elections.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to run?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t serve if I was appointed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who called who?\xc2\xa0 Do you know?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Senator Webb -- I think the President called Senator Webb, but I think that was --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before he made it public?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they had given you a heads-up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you done?\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After you, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I love it, bipartisanship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooooh --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I meant between networks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Golly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please note the groan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Please put \xe2\x80\x9cgroan\xe2\x80\x9d on the transcript.\xc2\xa0 Maybe \xe2\x80\x9cMixed groan and mixed laughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you done?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somebody say something.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know, I was going to say -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Knoller has got his --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it was not a negotiating -- I know, Knoller won\xe2\x80\x99t let it last very long.\xc2\xa0 If it was not a negotiating session, what was it today?\xc2\xa0 What was this lunch about?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday and as the President said at the end of last year, we needed to do a better job in reaching out and -- look, I think we saw what happened in the lame duck session of Congress that when we can sit around a table and talk about what we agree on and what common ground is there, that we can get things done on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 So I think this was an opportunity to listen to each other and to figure out where that common ground is.\xc2\xa0 Look, Chuck, I --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that one of the pieces of common ground, that you guys both agreed you didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk enough the last year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that came out in lunch on their side.\xc2\xa0 I know that that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President said in a room of both representatives of the House and the Senate last year, that he needed to do better, and we\xe2\x80\x99re resolved to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 It was pretty remarkable the position you guys laid out in the readout of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s call to Vice President Suleiman, putting our policy out there in public of what we consider acceptable as the United States government.\xc2\xa0 So even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to tell us what the consequences are, did Vice President Biden made it clear to Vice President Suleiman there are consequences in the U.S. relationship in some form or another if this policy isn\xe2\x80\x99t met?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Chuck, I think the greatest consequence are -- the greatest consequences are the continued protests that we see and the increase in the size of those protests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, as you heard the President say very early on in this, that every government has an obligation to represent its people.\xc2\xa0 And I think that while some had thought -- and I don\'t\xc2\xa0 -- maybe we can wait this out, maybe we can set up some committees and some commissions and life will return to normal -- I think that\'s largely been answered by a greater number of people representing a greater cross-section of Egyptian society who\xe2\x80\x99ve come out seeking their grievances to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are not likely to dissipate until the government takes some genuine steps, some of which we outlined.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But only they can solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 Only the government of Egypt can enter into a serious process here.\xc2\xa0 And again, I have no doubt that as we get farther and farther into this week, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see more and more of them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano testified this morning in front of the House committee and said in no uncertain terms that al-Awlaki in Yemen is the clearest threat -- terrorist threat to the United States and a bigger threat than Osama bin Laden or anything coming out of Afghanistan or Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Are we pursuing a new policy in terms of Yemen?\xc2\xa0 Does this alter our Afghanistan policy?\xc2\xa0 If this -- if the number one threat to the United States is now Yemen, the question that a lot of Americans may ask is then why is there so many troops in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand that one of the reasons why -- as you heard the President say in the State of the Union, one of the reasons why the breadth of the type of attack that we saw September 11th of 2001, why that is harder to take place today is because of the fact that in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, the leadership of al Qaeda is under the greatest pressure that it has seen since September 11th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, we came in and -- to be honest, as we had said during the campaign, we did not think the central front for al Qaeda was in Iraq, that we believed it was in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And we shifted our resources accordingly.\xc2\xa0 Obviously --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, now you guys are saying it\xe2\x80\x99s in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean we shift our resources again?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no -- and I can assure you our cooperation with and our relationship with the government of Yemen is incredibly important in addressing the counterterrorism threat that exists there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that in the past 10 years, as we come up to the anniversary of September 11, 2001, that the threat has evolved, as our response, too, has evolved.\xc2\xa0 We put greater pressure on Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and we have increased our cooperation with counterterrorism exercises with the government of Yemen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have confidence in Margaret Scobey?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Great, great confidence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you -- can you tell us if she -- is she the lead envoy now?\xc2\xa0 Or is there any thought of sending somebody like Ambassador Wisner back to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think Ambassador Wisner was sent to have one conversation that he had.\xc2\xa0 He reported back on that.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Scobey was well aware of that, and Ambassador Scobey takes part in the daily deputies committee meetings in the Situation Room run by the NSC in order to assess the situation on the ground in Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President aware that the Iranian opposition, Mr. Mousavi, has requested a permit to protest -- or give a sympathy protest on February 14th?\xc2\xa0 And does he have a message for the Iranian leaders on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the Iranian leaders mentioned something around watching what was happening in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And I think I challenged the Islamic Republic of Iran to show its responsiveness to its citizens by allowing such a march to happen.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if the government of Iran is confident enough in its meeting the demands of its people to let its people show the demands that they have of their government.\xc2\xa0 And we await their response.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you know if the Patriot Act extensions came up in the lunch meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I should have asked that question, and I don\'t know it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as I said here yesterday, we\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of that extension.\xc2\xa0 We actually -- I think as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see from our statement of administration policy I think that went out a couple of days ago, we support an even longer extension to take any of the uncertainty around extending these out past -- out into 2013 rather than just the 8th of December of this year.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that that gets figured out soon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think that\'s possible?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got more common ground on Republicans on that than with Democrats?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some concern on the Democratic side about seeing an extension bill -- I know at least in the Senate -- making sure that that extension extends longer than just a little more than 10 months.\xc2\xa0 But my sense is that that will get done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you get an answer on whether the Obamas voted?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the transcript yesterday, it should have said that they received their ballots, but they -- at least as of yesterday, about 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon had not filled them out.\xc2\xa0 I will check again.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they undecided?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check again and see if they voted.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m resisting making a joke --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And before you leave, can you tell us what they\'re really digging up out there on the North Lawn?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I told you.\xc2\xa0 They\'re moving the monument.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- they\'re going to do it at night.\xc2\xa0 Everyone is going to wake up and, where did that thing go?\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll look behind them and it will be --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the answer is no?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you, well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve erected this gray wall in front of my office that I\xe2\x80\x99ve threatened to go spray paint and make it a little bit more esthetically pleasing than -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what they are building -- do you even know?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked.\xc2\xa0 I probably should given the pounding that I hear in my office.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it is the monument.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the options the administration is considering on Fannie and Freddie essentially amount to cutting down the support for that market, which would either raise fees and/or lower the amount that could be borrowed with government guarantees.\xc2\xa0 Is the Obama administration going to backtrack on support for a working middle-class family buying houses?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me address your question in a couple of different ways, Mike.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the financial reform legislation that passed a little more than six months ago required a process for reforming the nation\xe2\x80\x99s housing finance market.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, Secretaries Geithner and Donovan will unveil what some of those options are, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for them to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you favor anything that made it harder for middle-class families to buy a house?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would favor both Secretaries rolling that out on Friday and answering all of your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the elements of the Republican proposal on the budget is to eliminate AmeriCorps.\xc2\xa0 Now, I remember -- eliminate funding for AmeriCorps, at least.\xc2\xa0 Now, I remember in Iowa standing there in the audience while Ted Sorensen stood by Barack Obama -- he was talking about his call to public service, and support for AmeriCorps figured prominently in his campaign for President.\xc2\xa0 Would he consider signing the piece of legislation that eliminated AmeriCorps?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from getting a piece of legislation to sign.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, we look forward to seeing what Republicans have put out.\xc2\xa0 You will see on Monday what the President puts out in a budget that over the course of the next five years will freeze spending levels resulting in cuts of about $400 billion and rolling us back to a spending level as a percentage of our economy that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen since Eisenhower was President.\xc2\xa0 I think we all agree that spending has to be reduced and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend a lot of time in the next several months working to see what investments need to be made to address the challenges that we have in the future, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what some of that debate is going to be about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will that be a question to them, eliminating AmeriCorps?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your multiple opportunities to get into a series of hypotheticals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask a question on Egypt?\xc2\xa0 What role has the advice you\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting from friendly Arab governments played in the sort of recalibrations of the administration policy over the last couple weeks?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What recalibration of administration policy do you speak of?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the main recalibration might be sort of the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d when we\xe2\x80\x99re calling for an orderly transition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to any of those governments but I interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d the same way the President did, and that was both when President Mubarak said he was leaving and when the President said that that transition must begin now. I think that was a week ago Monday.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s clear, Mike, that the government has not taken the necessary steps that the people of Egypt need to see.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why more and more people come out to register their grievances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But our notion of when the transition needed to have started hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 What the people of Egypt seek in those grievances hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 What has to change is the posture of the government in addressing what the people of Egypt need to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ari.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there much staff in the lunch?\xc2\xa0 Was it just the four principals?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe it was, on our side, the President, the Vice President, and the Chief of Staff; the Speaker, the Majority Leader and the Majority Whip -- a total of six.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So none of their staff?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Associated Press came out with an investigation showing that several different CIA officials who were involved in some of the worst abuses during the Bush administration and even some incidents in this administration have been promoted to leadership positions and consistently not disciplined.\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable with the system of discipline and accountability within the CIA?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has great confidence in the men and women that do the very difficult jobs at the CIA.\xc2\xa0 I have not looked into that and I would point you over to the CIA for that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is Friday your last day?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It still is, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It still is?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, technically, I will be here until Sunday, but my last briefing is Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re last briefing will be Friday.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you might share with us what advice you would give to Jay and any reflections you might have -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like -- Ari tried that just yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And then Ann did --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here until today.\xc2\xa0 I was having lunch with the First Lady yesterday --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Namedropper.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- where she made news and said the President --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I had lunch Amy Brundage in my office as I got ready to answer Ari and Ann\xe2\x80\x99s questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, since I missed it and you apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer it yesterday, how about today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did answer Ann\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer Ari\xe2\x80\x99s, awkwardly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just keep asking.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you everything that I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to Jay about for a whole host of reasons, much as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all have talked about what Jay is going to bring and aren\xe2\x80\x99t discussing those with myself and Jay.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the advice I have for him is the, I think, advice that I got from the people like Marlin Fitzwater and others who have done this job so well.\xc2\xa0 And that is, obviously first and foremost, regardless of what you know and what you\xe2\x80\x99re asked, your solemn obligation is to always tell the truth.\xc2\xa0 And while that may seem readily obvious, obviously in the past it\xe2\x80\x99s not always been the case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that as I said yesterday, I think it is remarkable to watch transpiring halfway around the world a fight for freedom of speech and a way of life that we have and we participate in each and every day here.\xc2\xa0 I think the universal values that this government espouses, one of those is a healthy freedom of the press and a desire to have an informed public based on sessions like the one we\xe2\x80\x99re having.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this -- while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the subject of halfway around the world, these sessions have been broadcast thousands of miles away and interpreted for billions of people.\xc2\xa0 They watch your questions and they watch this government\xe2\x80\x99s answers.\xc2\xa0 I think it reminds us of the seriousness with which we all approach our jobs each day and the seriousness with which the world watches the example of this country as an example for all the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, that and a lot of other things.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a dossier on all of this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?\xc2\xa0 The President and his relationship with the opposition is something that\xe2\x80\x99s watched around the world, too.\xc2\xa0 The luncheon today, you kind of skirted around the edges, very vague about what was talked, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get much specifics on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does a lunch like this in the bigger picture of things have much impact?\xc2\xa0 Is there a relationship between the President and the Speaker that takes root at something like this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think can only be a -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President believes this can be a one-time-only affair.\xc2\xa0 I think that in order to -- particularly in a government that is divided in its control, obviously the requirement for something to get here means it has to go through an entity that\xe2\x80\x99s controlled by the Republican Party and an entity that\xe2\x80\x99s controlled by the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 So we know without the type of dialogue and seeking of common ground that something like today\xe2\x80\x99s lunch does, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to see any progress on behalf of the American people on the issues that they have concerns about -- reducing our deficit, an atmosphere for creating jobs, the continued safety and security of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think all of those require that we try on both sides a little harder to understand where the other side is, and more importantly, to understand where we all agree.\xc2\xa0 And I think that continues that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President forswearing some of the sharper political rhetoric that he used in 2010?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, I think each entity would say that what is said in a campaign is different than -- we have campaigns for a reason, right?\xc2\xa0 We have -- people make choices and then after those campaigns we get about to governing the country.\xc2\xa0 I think what -- certainly what this President hopes is that we spend the next many months leading up to something that\xe2\x80\x99s far, far away, in 2012, that we spend the next many months addressing and finding that common ground and addressing the challenges that we know the American people want us to address.\xc2\xa0 There will be plenty of time to get back to a political campaign and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we spend time focusing on what\xe2\x80\x99s on people\xe2\x80\x99s minds.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that for a second?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow I believe the Republicans in the House will be unveiling about a half trillion dollars worth of specific budget cuts they want to enact relatively immediately.\xc2\xa0 Did the President in effect get a preview of that? \xc2\xa0Did they get that specific in this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think they talked broadly about the need to cut spending, but I am not aware that they got a preview of what they will unveil tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about tomorrow, but on the subject of the transition, do you know is Jay going to brief on Monday, dive right in?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe he will.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then can you talk a little bit -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a call with more specifics --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s not, he is now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to leave him some ties, some of those nice purple --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You like the -- maybe a couple of nice purple ties would do him well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a call with more specifics, but can you talk a little bit about what the President is going to be saying tomorrow on his trip to Michigan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me wait for that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the President is -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll get into some policy specifics on this, but obviously what the President outlined in the State of the Union with an agenda that out-innovates, out-educates and out-builds the competition.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focusing tomorrow in Marquette the portion of building the type of infrastructure and wireless networks that are needed to attract the jobs of tomorrow and to help train students to continue to be the most productive workforce in the world.\xc2\xa0 So we will highlight that tomorrow in the trip and they\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on that call.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President think Governor Kaine would make a pretty good senator in Virginia?\xc2\xa0 And does he think that Jim Webb might make a pretty good Secretary of Defense?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I should answer both of those questions on Monday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I -- without getting into who would be a good candidate for either one of those jobs, obviously, I think Senator Webb has great experience.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned his continued service to this country, and obviously his service in the Navy has been important.\xc2\xa0 And then obviously I think -- look, I particularly -- somebody like Governor Kaine was the governor of the state or commonwealth that I\xe2\x80\x99m from, and I think he did a terrific job as governor and is doing a terrific job as the chairman of the DNC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other quick question. \xc2\xa0The President obviously watches you.\xc2\xa0 I presume he watches you when -- has he ever -- what was the most interesting piece of advice or observation he had after observing one of these?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t recall necessarily that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I will say this, Glenn -- and I think one of the things that I think will continue not just with Jay but press secretaries that come after is the type of important access that each individual has and needs to do the type of job that you do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Each of the last several days, particularly I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to talk to him about Egypt and to talk to him about what our continued public messaging has to be.\xc2\xa0 And I know that Jay will enjoy the same type of access that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had and that others before me have had in being able to go in and get from the President his thoughts directly.\xc2\xa0 And I think that will be a great benefit to you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I asked you a question --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know Ari --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s April\xe2\x80\x99s voice and it\xe2\x80\x99s your heard, and -- freaked me out.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking you a question for the last couple of days, and I hope you have an answer --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, is this the calls?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Am I going to get this by Friday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will get this for you tonight.\xc2\xa0 I went in to ask him about voting, and I got the answer.\xc2\xa0 And I came back, and about 15 minutes later, I went to try to get the second answer, and he had gone to have dinner with the girls and I did not get an answer.\xc2\xa0 I will get that as soon as I get out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I look forward to getting it for Friday.\xc2\xa0 Now, also on the budget cuts, Jack Lew says that $350 million will be cut from the community service block grants.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to the poor and grassroots communities that benefit from these community block grants, as they also supported this President when he was then candidate Obama, as they believed he felt their pain?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he does understand the importance of this funding.\xc2\xa0 But as Jack Lew said in his op-ed, and as the President and Jack have talked about in the construction of the budget, we have reached a point where we have to do something about what we take in and what we spend and the great divergence in those two numbers, and that this process is not going to be an easy one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It means that on each side we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to give a little on things that are even -- even that are greatly important to us.\xc2\xa0 And if we simply exempted everything that was important to everybody in this process, we would simply continue the process of spending much, much more than we have.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in the September the 10th press conference that the President had, he talked about his efforts as a community -- someone who was in the community, who worked for the community.\xc2\xa0 And how far -- and he understands -- he said he understood what it meant to be an advocate for grassroots organizations, advocate for communities.\xc2\xa0 But how far did the President go to spare these $350 million cuts to these programs?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously, we had to make a series of decisions.\xc2\xa0 I think when you see the budget come out, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see very little that was spared in the tough decisions that had to be made to construct a budget that gets us back on a path toward fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about the grassroots; it\xe2\x80\x99s that all of these decisions are going to be tough.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quite frankly, we -- all of the easy decisions have been made.\xc2\xa0 Those decisions are going to not just impact the type of discretionary spending, April, that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the Secretary of Defense is -- has made it one of his priorities to get rid of weapons programs that even those in the military don\xe2\x80\x99t want.\xc2\xa0 So there are a series of tough decisions that will be laid out both in the budget that the President has, and in going forward, that even make changes to things that we believe are priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions, brief ones -- one on American politics, one on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We know what you think of Chairman Kaine.\xc2\xa0 Since his conversation with Senator Webb has the President had a phone conversation with Chairman Kaine or former Congressman Perriello?</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of either one.\xc2\xa0 I will double-check, but -- see, when I came out here, he had not spoken with either one of those, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And regarding Egypt right now, we all know very much about the conversations the Vice President has with Vice President Suleiman.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken of contacts with other levels of government.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration in touch with Dr. ElBaradei or with the former Egyptian foreign minister who sounds increasingly like a candidate for president?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that -- let me check and see if the embassy has any more guidance.\xc2\xa0 I know that the embassy reached out and talk with Mr. ElBaradei, I want to say sometime -- a lot of days run together -- I think sometime early last week.\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can get a better sense of when that date was and whether we\xe2\x80\x99ve had other contact with each of those individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 On Egypt, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said several times in this briefing that the discussions need to be broadened out between the Vice President and opposition groups.\xc2\xa0 Well, some of these opposition groups there, particularly the young people who have been leading the movement don\xe2\x80\x99t want to meet with Vice President Suleiman until Mubarak is gone.\xc2\xa0 What is your message to them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it before, if one side is unwilling to do anything in terms of change, and one side is not willing to meet until that side takes up all the change, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find yourself in an intractable position.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it is incumbent upon each side to play an important and constructive role.\xc2\xa0 From the side of the government we have, I think, very clearly laid out the steps, both in broadening those that are being talked to and then the steps that they should take on a path towards -- on an orderly transitioned path towards free and fair elections.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the opposition also has to come up with -- a whole host of those in the opposition need to come up with a path forward as well.\xc2\xa0 I think that that conversation and those negotiations have got to take place or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find ourselves in a largely intractable position.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go here and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go there and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0On Egypt again, I just came back from Cairo, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t hear them as much or hear about them as much, but there are major pro-Mubarak demonstrations.\xc2\xa0 And you could hear more and more from the first days to the last days people screaming, U.S. stay out of this.\xc2\xa0 And so to which point is the administration worried that by supporting too openly the pro-democracy movement, it will fuel more dangerous anti-American sentiments?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is not for us to decide or determine.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I think what we see happening is -- what we see in terms of the growing number of crowds, people protesting, the demands of which can only met by the government.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t be met by us and they can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t, quite frankly, compel any of the government to, well, just take this step.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQuite frankly, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, we can\xe2\x80\x99t provide the definition of what those freedoms look like for the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 So I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us say from very beginning of this that these are challenges that can only be solved by the people in Egypt, on both side of this.\xc2\xa0 That has been our posture the entire time, and that will continue to be our posture.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message of this administration to the young people in Egypt demonstrating in the street?\xc2\xa0 According to reporters, some of them have banners saying, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, we can, too.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready to die for democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What do you want to tell them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I want to tell them is I think as the President said in his remarks after President Mubarak stepped down, that we hear your call for and respect your call for the universal rights that we\xe2\x80\x99ve advocated that the government of Egypt pursue, and that it is clear to all of those that watch that unless or until progress is made, it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely that any of those crowds are going away.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent that the government of Egypt, without delay, proceed in a process that provides the sort of immediate, irreversible progress that Vice President Biden talked about yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tommy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all on Egypt, over the weekend, Sarah Palin said of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response, we need to know what it is that America stands for so we know who it is America stands with.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering do you think that\'s sort of a dog whistle to the birthers?\xc2\xa0 And is that a question of the President\xe2\x80\x99s American-ness?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know I -- Tommy, I said to -- I think Dan asked me this question on Monday --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just like that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Let me rephrase that.\xc2\xa0 Let me rephrase that. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Dan had asked me to respond to Sarah Palin.\xc2\xa0 I think my response was that after having read what she said several times, it was hard for me to discern what she particularly was saying, so therefore I didn\'t really have an immediate reaction to, nor do I have upon reflection any either greater understanding as to what she said or reaction to it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she seems to be questioning the President\xe2\x80\x99s American-ness.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have a reaction?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I read that answer probably four times and still don\'t know what she -- still don\'t know what she said.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were getting ready to say --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Webb was -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Secretary of the Navy, but obviously a Marine.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is tomorrow your last Air Force One ride?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 It is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0END</p>\n<p>\n\t3:05 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
