Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:55 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New glasses -- again?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You think these are new?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Maybe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you leave them on the bumper again?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not this time.\xc2\xa0 Not this time.\xc2\xa0 These could be old; they could be new.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I get started I wanted, on a serious note, to say something about two journalists who were killed yesterday in Syria.\xc2\xa0 As you know, last week I, aboard Air Force One, said something about Anthony Shadid, who died last week in Syria.\xc2\xa0 These tragic deaths underscore something that I think we all -- all of us in this room, since we participate in -- I did once and you do now -- in this profession -- it\'s a reminder of the incredible risk that journalists take -- Marie Colvin, Anthony Shadid, and the French photojournalist who was killed yesterday as well -- in order to bring the truth about what\'s happening in a country like Syria to those of us at home and in countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 And our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those journalists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s a reminder, too, that the victims are many, and overwhelmingly, in this case, they are innocent Syrian civilians. The brutality of the Assad regime becomes ever more apparent each day -- as each day goes by.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I just wanted to mention that -- and go to questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Sticking with Syria, you said yesterday that international action is needed before the situation in Syria becomes too chaotic.\xc2\xa0 But given this latest incident and the continued shelling in Syria, how much more chaotic can things get?\xc2\xa0 What exactly is the international community waiting for at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the international community has acted through the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Russia and China vetoed a resolution that would have passed through the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 But there is overwhelming international support for the condemnation of Assad and his regime\'s atrocities and actions, and overwhelming support for the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\'s an ever-growing coalition of nations, if you will, who are part of the "Friends of Syria" that the United States is part of, and together we will continue to enhance the pressure on Assad, continue to help the opposition become more functional, continue to work to bring humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, and continue to call on the international community collectively to take greater action to pressure Assad and to force him to relinquish power so that the Syrian people can have the democratic future that they deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about helping the opposition, the main opposition group said today that foreign military intervention may be necessary in order for humanitarian aid to make it into Syria.\xc2\xa0 I know you said yesterday that humanitarian aid is needed.\xc2\xa0 Would the U.S. support foreign military intervention for the purpose of getting humanitarian aid into Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\'s a useful comparative here to Libya.\xc2\xa0 I\'m often asked this question in the -- using that comparison.\xc2\xa0 And what we had in Libya when there was outside military intervention was a unified international community, a call for intervention by the Libyan people, the prospect of an immediate assault by Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces on an entire city, Benghazi, and the possibility that international military action could have -- could halt that and could limit or prevent the deaths of many, many thousands of Libyans.</p>\n<p>\n\tEach country in the region where we have had this kind of unrest is different, and certainly Syria is different from Libya in many of those particulars that I just laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will work with the international community to provide humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to press the international community to condemn Assad and his actions, and to take action to further pressure and sanction his regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now -- and I was asked this yesterday, and I just want to make clear that we do not believe that adding to the militarization of Syria is the right approach.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the right approach is for the international community to speak with one voice to pressure Assad and get him to relinquish power and to cease the brutal assault on his own people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that apply also to military intervention for the purpose of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, right now we believe that the appropriate action is a diplomatic, economic approach, the likes of which we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could switch briefly over to the corporate tax proposal -- when the President has rolled out other proposals from his State of the Union address, he\xe2\x80\x99s been out front in doing so, but today\xe2\x80\x99s proposal came from the Treasury Department and Secretary Geithner.\xc2\xa0 Why not have the President out front?\xc2\xa0 Why put this distance between he and the proposal today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly disagree that there is distance between the President and his Secretary of the Treasury. Tim Geithner has developed this proposal, working with his team and the economic team here in the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President -- you should have by now -- if not, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have it momentarily -- has put out a full statement laying out why he believes this corporate tax reform that he and his administration is putting forward today is so important; why it fits into his overall blueprint for an \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica Built to Last,\xe2\x80\x9d where everyone gets a fair shot and plays by the same rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is very committed to corporate tax reform, as he made clear at the State of the Union address last year in 2011.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that this is an area where an opportunity exists, an opportunity to disprove the conventional wisdom that nothing can get done in an election year between a White House held by one party and a Congress largely controlled by the other.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfter all, there is a fair amount of consensus that simplifying the corporate tax code is a good idea, that broadening the base and lowering the rate is a good idea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has put forward a proposal that does that; that in doing that eliminates unnecessary and expensive subsidies and carved-out special provisions for corporations like oil and gas companies that don\xe2\x80\x99t need them; that eliminates the carried interest rule that allows hedge fund managers and private equity investors to -- or managers -- to pay a far lower tax rate on their income than firefighters and teachers -- and everyone probably in this room -- and thereby creates a corporate tax code that allows American businesses to be more competitive globally, that incentivizes manufacturing in the United States, that takes away the incentive for companies to relocate overseas and reverses that and creates incentives for companies to insource again in the United States -- a trend the President believes is very important to our economic future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99s very supportive of this proposal and hopes that Congress will see in this an opportunity to prove the critics wrong, to show that we can get things done this year for the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tReuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Picking up on the discussion of gas prices from yesterday, is it fair for the American voter or the American public to blame any President -- in this case, this President and his administration -- when gas prices start going up so high?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think this President, as I said yesterday, fully appreciates the impact of higher gas prices on average Americans trying to make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 He talked about that yesterday in the event where he discussed the extension of the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the reasons in both 2011 and now this year that cutting the payroll tax for 160 million Americans is so important is because it gives the average American family an extra $40 per paycheck, close to $1,000 per year, to pay for things like gasoline, to fill up their tanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99s very aware of the impact that it has and fully understands the anxiety it creates.\xc2\xa0 And he understood that when he was running for President back in 2008 when there was a spike in the price of oil.\xc2\xa0 There has since been, as you know, last year and again this year -- this is a recurrent problem and it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that reinforces the need that he identified back when he was a candidate for a comprehensive energy strategy, one that takes an all-of-the-above approach to the development of our energy -- sources of energy; one that insists that we can safely and responsibly expand our domestic oil and gas production, which he has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery year since he\'s been President, we\'ve increased our oil and gas production.\xc2\xa0 Every year since he\'s been President, we\'ve decreased our reliance on foreign oil imports.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, every year since he\'s been President, he has made a focus of the importance of investing in alternative energy technology, because that combination is the one that will build a foundation for energy security in the future, so that we are not as vulnerable to the kinds of price shocks that we get when oil climbs, as it is now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I said yesterday, we need to do the things that we can control to insulate ourselves from the things that we can\'t. And that includes oil prices that are going up in spite of the fact that domestic oil production is going up; oil prices that are going up globally in spite of the fact that the President has made clear -- put in place policies that will dramatically expand the amount of exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, will expand the amount of exploration in Alaska, will expand the amount of natural gas production here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, these prices are going up.\xc2\xa0 And that tells you that there are other things beyond our control, like unrest in the Middle East, or other factors like the growth of emerging countries such as China and India.\xc2\xa0 So in that kind of environment, in that kind of world, we need to do everything we can here at home to insulate ourselves from these price shocks.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President\'s been doing since he took office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President accept any responsibility for the fact that the prices are going up, especially -- or has any response to things --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President accepts responsibility that he identified the next President should accept back in 2008, which is the need to develop a comprehensive energy policy that protects Americans in the long run from these kinds of situations, and that makes America more secure and energy independent.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the policy he\'s proposed.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that if you\'re suggesting that there\'s responsibility for price hikes in the global -- I mean, a rise in the global price of oil, it\'s certainly not because of anything he hasn\'t done to expand domestic oil and gas production, because he has done -- taken significant action to expand American gas and oil production.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe will continue to do that as he takes action to, for example, as I mentioned yesterday, allow for the first nuclear reactor to be built in this country in 30 years; to increase our investments in alternative energy like biodiesel and wind and solar.\xc2\xa0 I mean he\xe2\x80\x99s an all-of-the-above -- his is an all-of-the-above approach, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot about that from him in coming days and weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if a candidate like Rick Santorum says the reason these things are going -- these prices are going up is because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s dedication to the radical environmentalist movement --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon those who report on random statements by politicians seeking office to compare them to the facts, and the facts are as I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated.\xc2\xa0 Oil and gas production in the United States has risen every year since the President has been in office.\xc2\xa0 Oil production is now higher than it\xe2\x80\x99s been in eight years.\xc2\xa0 And this President is taking action to ensure that it continues to go up.</p>\n<p>\n\tNot least -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to mention, and I don\'t know where various candidates for office are on this issue, but the President last year through an agreement with major automobile manufacturers have put into effect enhanced fuel-efficiency standards that will save American families $1.7 trillion at the pump, and cut oil consumption by 12 billion -- I think yesterday I said 12 million because 12 billion sounded like so much, and it is.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that action alone did more to enhance our long-term energy independence than almost anything any President could do.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the briefing on the tax proposal, Secretary Geithner said that they\'re using this proposal today to move the process along, which, as you know, can take time.\xc2\xa0 And he said it\xe2\x80\x99s designed so corporate tax reform could be done alone, but it might have to be done with individual tax reform, which will come after the presidential election.\xc2\xa0 Given that, what is your timeframe for really getting this done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply agree with Secretary Geithner that there is an opportunity here to do it alone or singularly with just corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a very specific framework of his approach -- that explains his approach to corporate reform.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity, as I just said, because of apparent interest by both Democrats and Republicans to reform our corporate tax code, to take action now.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no reason why Congress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take this up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also the case that if Congress were to feel itself particularly bullish about the possibility of bipartisan cooperation that they could take up individual tax reform.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles on individual tax reform are pretty clear as well.\xc2\xa0 So there is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the case that you could do this by itself or you could do it with individual tax reform.\xc2\xa0 We would welcome action by Congress, in accordance with the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles, in either case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the President himself doing to encourage the Congress to feel bullish about bipartisan progress?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Secretary Geithner himself, who is obviously the President\xe2\x80\x99s Treasury Secretary, has already spoken with leaders in Congress about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 Or has he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls or conversations of the President to report, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will be having these discussions.\xc2\xa0 And, look, if there is interest in pursuing this corporate tax reform plan by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, the President is very interested in doing that.\xc2\xa0 And that goes along -- that also applies to individual tax reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think as Secretary Geithner made clear, he\xe2\x80\x99s already begun this conversation with Republicans and Democrats on the Hill with regards to corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that conversation continues and that we can produce a result for the American people and for American businesses that will have -- that will create the result of a lower tax rate for American businesses that will -- and that will make them more competitive; a broader base to ensure that this reform doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add a dime to the deficit; and a situation where the American manufacturing sector, and in particular, the advanced manufacturing sector, is further incentivized to grow, and where small businesses are -- where the environment is made easier for small businesses to deal with the tax code by simplifying the tax code for them, allowing them to, for example, expense up to $1 million.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are a variety of other measures that are part of this corporate tax reform that would make American businesses much more competitive.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten any feedback from the CEOs that the administration talks to about the plan already today that you can share with us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to share with you.\xc2\xa0 I think that we believe that the reception so far has been positive and will be positive because it does what so many people say is important to do, which is -- and this is Democrats and Republicans -- which is lower the rate, broaden the base, eliminate the underbrush of unnecessary subsidies and loopholes and special provisions that complicate the tax code and basically have the taxpayer subsidizing oil and gas companies, for example, which enjoyed record profits last year and certainly seem to be on track to enjoy significant profits this year and don\xe2\x80\x99t need those kinds of subsidies.\xc2\xa0 That money can then be used to pay for an action that would lower the rates for everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House keeps praising these journalists who are -- who have been killed</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about "keeps."\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve commented, Vice President Biden did it in a statement.\xc2\xa0 How does that square with the fact that this administration has been so aggressively trying to stop aggressive journalism in the United States by using the Espionage Act to take whistleblowers to court?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re currently -- I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve evoked it the sixth time -- and before the Obama administration it had only been used three times in history.\xc2\xa0 This is the sixth time you\xe2\x80\x99re suing a CIA officer for allegedly providing information in 2009 about CIA torture.\xc2\xa0 Certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s in the public interest of the United States; his administration is taking this person to court.\xc2\xa0 There just seems to be a disconnect here.\xc2\xa0 You want aggressive journalism abroad -- you just don\xe2\x80\x99t want it in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would hesitate to speak to any particular case for obvious reasons and I would refer you to the Department of Justice for more on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that we absolutely honor and praise the bravery of reporters who are placing themselves in extremely dangerous situations in order to bring the story of oppression and brutality to the world.\xc2\xa0 I think that is commendable and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly worth noting by us. And as somebody who knew both Anthony and Marie, I particularly appreciate what they did to bring that story to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for other cases, again, without addressing any specific case, I think that there are issues here that involve highly-sensitive, classified information, and I think that those are -- divulging that kind of information is a serious issue and always has been.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the truth should come out abroad; it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come out here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not at all what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, Jake, and you know it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 Again I can\xe2\x80\x99t specific--</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Justice Department is doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re making a judgment about a broad array of cases and I can\xe2\x80\x99t address those specifically.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a judgment that a lot of whistleblowers organizations and good government groups are making as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not one that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we go back to gas prices because I wanted to ask about what -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s case seems to be to deal with this issue now is we\xe2\x80\x99ve really increased oil production.\xc2\xa0 When you go back to 2008, the President repeatedly mocked Senator McCain and this whole "drill here, drill now," "drill, baby, drill" -- all of that was mocked, that it was a dumb idea.\xc2\xa0 Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re holding it up as a really great idea.\xc2\xa0 How do you square those two?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, there\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction here that you\xe2\x80\x99re missing.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s approach has been to responsibly increase domestic oil and gas production.\xc2\xa0 What he has never said, and what I attempted, I thought, to appropriately mock yesterday, was the idea that there are magic solutions, that you can put forward a proposal to cut the price at the pump in half on a piece of paper with a couple of magic beans.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not realistic.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is oil and gas production in this country has been increasing, and even as it has been increasing the price of oil has been going up globally.\xc2\xa0 That tells you that there are factors that are not entirely within our control.\xc2\xa0 And putting forward to the American people that simply by drilling more you\xe2\x80\x99re going to resolve this problem for the long term is not being honest with the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why you need a comprehensive energy strategy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you need an all-of-the-above approach.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you need to invest in clean energy technologies, as well as open up millions of acres -- of new acres in the Gulf of Mexico to exploration; as well as allow for the building and permitting of the first nuclear reactor in this country in 30 years.\xc2\xa0 You need to do it all.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the only approach that is responsible.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd to suggest to Americans that there is some other way, that you can wave a magic wand and cut oil prices and cut gas prices, is simply not treating the American people with the kind of respect they deserve -- because they know better.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t mock John McCain in 2008 on this issue?\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t repeatedly say --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I said that, then and now, the President believed that there is not -- that drilling alone was the way to resolve our energy security problems.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not, as evidenced by the fact that domestic oil and gas production has increased every year that he\'s been in office, and yet oil prices -- we experience these spikes in oil prices.\xc2\xa0 And I think that tells you that the way to insulate ourselves, the way to insulate the American people from these kind of price shocks, is to increase our energy independence, to reduce our reliance on foreign oil, to increase our capacity for alternative energy production as well as traditional fossil fuel production.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach the President\'s taking.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not -- drilling alone will not solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 That was true in 2008; it\'s true in 2012.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 In \'08 and then throughout his presidency, he\'s talked about a comprehensive plan, as you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 But at the end of last year, when White House officials were talking about the 2012 agenda, it was suggested that the only must-pass legislation -- you were talking about this earlier -- by a Democratic White House working with a Republican House -- the only real must-pass was the payroll tax cut extension.\xc2\xa0 So how can you now say that dealing with an energy plan now is something the President really wants to do, when in December you weren\'t talking about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- he has been talking about this consistently since he was sworn into office.\xc2\xa0 And the point about extending the payroll tax cut was the fact that Congress, which had not shown a great deal of interest -- Republicans -- in bipartisan cooperation on difficult issues, that the one issue that we felt confident was a must-do piece for them, as well as us, because of the political price they would pay for raising taxes on 160 million Americans, was extending the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we fully hope and expect that Congress will do more than that.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to Congress taking action on the President\xe2\x80\x99s refinance proposal which could put up to $3,000 in the pockets of average, responsible American homeowners; taking action on an infrastructure investment bill that could put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back to work and allow for the building of -- rebuilding of our infrastructure in this country -- roads, bridges, schools, highways, ports; and taking action to, if they felt really emboldened by this bipartisan potential, putting teachers back to work, taking action on some of the other provisions in the American Jobs Act, as well as corporate tax reform, as well as measures that would enhance our energy security.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point is, is that the sky is the limit here if Congress is willing to work with this administration, if Democrats and Republicans are willing to work together on the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll the way in the back, yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 Welcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I would like to know if you know of any educational initiatives the President has in place to better prepare students for success at college or university level?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has pursued since he took office comprehensive education reform.\xc2\xa0 Race to the Top has been one of the unheralded -- by the media largely -- bipartisan successes that this President has pushed forward, working with the Secretary of Education.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has also expanded access to Pell grants to allow for more Americans to attend college, and he will push forward with broad education initiatives.\xc2\xa0 Because if you may remember -- I know folks in this room do -- his State of the Union address last year, in 2011, he talked about the need for the United States to out-educate and out-innovate the competition globally.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t -- we cannot win economically in the 21st century if we don\'t have the best-educated workforce.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven though -- one of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a trend towards insourcing, American companies bringing jobs back to the United States, is when they look at all of the factors that go into deciding where to locate a factory or where to locate a business, other countries may have lower labor prices, but we have a skilled, educated workforce that can bring great value to American businesses, as well as international businesses.\xc2\xa0 We have to keep that up.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s very committed to education.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I return to Syria?\xc2\xa0 You were talking about the "Friends of Syria" meeting that will happen later this week, and part of the goal is making the opposition more "functional" is the word you used.\xc2\xa0 What do you mean, and how would we help make the opposition more functional?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would work with the "Friends of Syria" to help stand them up, to cement its organizational capacity, its unity, so that there is an entity in place as this inevitable transition occurs -- because, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of if, but when Assad gives up the reins of power in the Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we will do that, working with the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d working with this broad coalition of members of the international community who are committed to the Syrian people, to their right to a democratic transition, and strongly condemn and oppose the brutality of the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So some NGOs are calling for recognizing the opposition as a transitional government.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the U.S. supports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the process here.\xc2\xa0 I think that helping to organize and unify the opposition is something that we are doing in cooperation with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 This is an entity that is emerging as the brutality of the Assad regime continues, and so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeframe on if or when something like that would happen.\xc2\xa0 But right now we\xe2\x80\x99re just working with the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria\xe2\x80\x9d to help them organize, help them unify.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I get you to clarify remarks out of both the White House and the State Department yesterday -- if pressure on Assad does not work, are we considering arming the opposition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear that our position is that it is not appropriate now to contribute to the militarization, the further militarization of Syria.\xc2\xa0 What I said and I think what was said in the State Department was simply to make clear that we don\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional measures if the international community waits too long and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act decisively.\xc2\xa0 But that is not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not hinting at imminent action or change.\xc2\xa0 Our position is that it is not appropriate to contribute to the militarization of Syria, that there is opportunity still now for this process to result in the departure from power of Assad and a democratic transition to begin to take place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are estimated 100 civilians that were killed in the city of Homs yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Why would we intervene on behalf of the rebels in Libya and not help those in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent question and I attempted to answer that a little bit earlier, but you ask it more directly, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to address it.\xc2\xa0 The comparative is useful in that it demonstrates why it is important to not have a one-size-fits-all approach, because the situations can be different even though the broader unrest in the region obviously is similar or reflects an overall trend in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Libya, as you recall, there was support at the international level, broad support of the United Nations Security Council resolution.\xc2\xa0 There was a request from the Libyan opposition and the Libyan people for direct military intervention, outside military intervention.\xc2\xa0 And, most importantly, there was the opportunity identified by the President and other leaders, and military leaders of NATO, to have the dramatic impact of preventing a massacre in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 There was a city coming under assault by Qaddafi forces.\xc2\xa0 And the situation in Syria is different in all of those particulars that I just laid out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, we\'re not ruling stuff out in the future, ruling actions out in the future.\xc2\xa0 But right now, we believe that the right approach is not to contribute to the militarization, and to pursue a path of pressuring Assad, isolating Assad, and furthering along the process that will ultimately lead to him stepping down or no longer being in power.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then finally, would we support and help establish a safe haven?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Within Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that military action is the right course -- contributing to the militarization of Syria is the right path right now.\xc2\xa0 We are, through humanitarian assistance and pursuing the provision of humanitarian assistance, pursuing the international effort to assist the opposition in organizing itself and unifying itself.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of a military action to secure a part of the country, that is not currently a policy we\'re pursuing.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 On Iran, as you know, the IAEA inspectors returned, basically saying that they felt their trip was unsuccessful.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House\'s reaction?\xc2\xa0 And to what extent does this compound or add to the tensions that are already there with Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we regret the failure of Iran to reach an agreement this week with the IAEA that would permit the agency to fully investigate the serious allegation raised -- allegations, rather, raised in its November report.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the IAEA maintains regular access to both of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s enrichment facilities at Qom and Natanz. The IAEA was seeking additional access -- that\'s what this visit was about -- in line with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s safeguards obligations, to sites and facilities where Iran is suspected of conducting work related to weaponization activity.\xc2\xa0 So, unfortunately, this is another demonstration of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to abide by its international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to evaluate, working with our P5-plus-1 partners, the letter in response -- that we received from the Iranians in response to Lady Ashton\xe2\x80\x99s letter about the possibility of engaging in talks.\xc2\xa0 But this particular action by Iran suggests that they have not changed their behavior when it comes to abiding by their international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the tax reform plan, as you know, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is giving his own economic speech today in which he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about his tax reform plan.\xc2\xa0 He was initially going to give that speech on Friday and he moved it up.\xc2\xa0 But was the timing of today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement in any way meant to preempt the unveiling of that speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for quite some time now that our corporate tax reform proposal would be put forward at the end of the month, roughly within the timeframe of the submission of the budget.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve kept to that schedule.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps others are timing their announcements around ours.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that Secretary Geithner has been working on with the White House economic team and the Treasury team for quite some time, and we identified this time period as a time to release it a number of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, tonight is the 20th Republican presidential debate, potentially the last presidential debate.\xc2\xa0 Given that, will the President watch tonight?\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the past.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any plans to watch this final --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So the question is why is this night so different from any other?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t ask him today, this morning if he planned to watch it.\xc2\xa0 I suspect, knowing him, knowing his viewing habits, that he will not watch it.\xc2\xa0 He has a family at home.\xc2\xa0 He tends to, when he watches TV at all, it\xe2\x80\x99s either sports or a movie.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t expect he will.\xc2\xa0 But the President obviously keeps up with what\xe2\x80\x99s in the news and will, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, be aware of the general back-and-forth in the debate come tomorrow morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the President is going to face off with one of these candidates, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it important for him to see the debate and not just -- I know you said he\xe2\x80\x99s read about the debates.\xc2\xa0 But I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a part of understanding the strategy --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there is ample time between now and early November for him to prepare for what will be debates with his opponent once that opponent emerges from this process.\xc2\xa0 I think -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not pushing up against a deadline here.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared when that time comes.\xc2\xa0 He might look at a little tape when that time comes.\xc2\xa0 But for now, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue his practice of finding something better to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.\xc2\xa0 How are you, Mara?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify what you said to Norah, you said Syria is different, and then you listed all the criteria that made Libyan opposition the correct choice.\xc2\xa0 So if there was an imminent massacre in Syria, then you\xe2\x80\x99d be considering --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are ways to speculate about individual things, conditions that might be in place.\xc2\xa0 What was the case in Libya is that all those conditions were in place that created an opportunity where international, outside military action to prevent the slaughter of civilians, to enforce a no-fly zone, was an option that the international community could take.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo my point in making that comparison is that it was those<br/>\n\t-- that set of circumstances that made that option achievable, and that is the one the President pursued with many, many international partners, very importantly, including countries from the region.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just making the distinction because it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say, well, you did this in that country why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do it in this?\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize the different circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying right now none of those things are --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there was not a United Nations Security Council resolution passed.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a different military situation on the ground, if you will, and just different circumstances in general.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also to follow up on Jessica\xe2\x80\x99s question about tax reform -- you said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles on individual tax reform are as clear as well.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he also wants to lower rates and broaden the base there, too?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, his principles are clear.\xc2\xa0 They are the Buffett Rule, as you know and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him and I and others talk about.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d talk about it, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard "me" talk about it -- that\xe2\x80\x99s just correct grammar.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not really tax reform, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly it is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- raising taxes on one individual --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s ensuring that millionaires and billionaires don\xe2\x80\x99t pay a lower effective tax rate than average, working Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has made clear that his approach to tax reform would ensure that those making under $250,000 a year will not see their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 That is a principle.\xc2\xa0 He is committed to the expiration of the high-end Bush tax cuts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the set of principles that he has put in place in terms of the individual tax code could very well be translated into individual tax reform.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken at length about the individual tax code and he has put forward a framework for corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is the kind of thing when people ask me about why executive actions and "We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait," this is the kind of thing that a President can\xe2\x80\x99t do on his own.\xc2\xa0 He needs congressional cooperation, and he looks forward to having it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m confused about -- you just listed the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on certain tax policies.\xc2\xa0 When people say tax reform, they generally mean broadening the base and lowering rates.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about when you talk about individual tax reform the way you are with corporate tax reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I agree with your premise that tax reform follows that formula.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President is less progressive --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is the formula that applies to the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which is an approach shared by many others to corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 The approach that the President has taken on individual tax rates is that we should not have a tax code that\xe2\x80\x99s skewed to benefit -- through the carried interest rule or other itemized deductions, other means that allow for millionaires and billionaires to pay a lower effective tax rate than average Americans.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that folks earning up $250,000 -- families earning up to $250,000 should see their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 He does believe that those making more than $250,000 should see their taxes go up because the unaffordable Bush tax cuts for high-income Americans need to expire at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But even those principles, does he believe in broadening the base and lowering rates in general?\xc2\xa0 Keeping all the progressivity you just mentioned, does he believe that that is what we should do --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that progressivity is an important principle here, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one that is reflected in his embrace of the Buffett Rule and his embrace of expiring -- making sure that the higher-end Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about broadening the base and getting rid of deductions?\xc2\xa0 Because the President has --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has put --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- take another question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me get some others here.\xc2\xa0 I think, Mara, you know we have put forward proposals in the past -- last summer and fall -- that included limiting itemized deductions for high-income Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a way of a broadening the base.\xc2\xa0 Eliminating the carried interest rule is a way of broadening the base so that hedge fund managers who are simply earning income don\xe2\x80\x99t pay a capital gains rate, they pay at an income tax rate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think this President has put forward both on paper and through speeches quite a bit of information about his approach to individual taxes.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On corporate tax reform, are you comfortable with the idea that while you are closing certain corporate loopholes, this -- your proposal does in its own way pick winners and losers in the sense that there are new advantages for manufacturers and clean energy makers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are comfortable with an approach that eliminates a huge amount of the complications, loopholes, special provisions, subsidies from the tax code, and focuses the tax code on growing the American manufacturing sector, growing the advanced manufacturing sector, and assisting small businesses, which are, after all, an important engine of economic growth and a hugely important engine of job growth in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, we believe that we need to eliminate a lot of the existing complexities from the tax code, and then identify very clearly what our priorities are when it comes to manufacturing, advanced manufacturing and small businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you kept saying, in response to the questions about gas prices, that we need to insulate ourselves against these higher prices and world events, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Yet you\xe2\x80\x99ve explained how domestic production is at a high level and it\xe2\x80\x99s doing apparently very little to insulate us on the world oil market.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, are you -- if we do continue to pursue Obama\xe2\x80\x99s sort of all-of-the-above policies and accomplish the things that the President is seeking, will that be enough to counter what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the world oil markets?\xc2\xa0 Will what he\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting lead to lower gas prices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what this President is pursuing -- the policies that he\'s already put in place and the policies that he is pursuing will do is reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\xc2\xa0 And by definition, that will create a situation where we have greater energy security in the future than we have had in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can\'t predict what oil prices will be in a year or two years or even six months.\xc2\xa0 I would be careful of anyone who says they can.\xc2\xa0 But what we can do through policy is increase our domestic production of oil and gas, increase our overall domestic sources of energy, including alternative energy, and thereby insulate ourselves from some of the shocks that come in the future.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take care --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- what we know, for example, if through the car rule, the enhanced fuel efficiency standards that the President put into place, is that we will save $12 billion of oil because of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Barrels.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Barrels, sorry -- 12 billion barrels of -- this is the second time I\'ve blown it.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Henry -- 12 billion barrels of oil.\xc2\xa0 That is a heck of a lot of oil.\xc2\xa0 And absent those fuel efficiency standards, we know that we would be paying for that oil, and we would be paying for a certain portion of that we would be paying foreign providers of that oil.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo these are important steps that we can take to insulate ourselves from energy shocks in the future.\xc2\xa0 You\'re shaking your head, but it\'s absolutely logical here.\xc2\xa0 The more -- the less we rely on foreign oil, the less dependence we have, the more energy security we have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that true?\xc2\xa0 Do you -- if we increase domestic oil production, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it just go onto the world market with all the rest of the oil?\xc2\xa0 It does very little to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we increase domestic oil and gas production, understanding that increasing domestic oil and gas production alone won\'t solve our energy challenges, it will mean that we can continue to reduce, hopefully, our imports of foreign oil, reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 And thereby, when you have problems in a region of the world that produces oil, you are -- the effect on your own production -- your own dependence on that -- the reduction in your dependence on that insulates you from some of that shock.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will that lead to lower gas prices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict gas prices.\xc2\xa0 What I know is that it increases our energy security.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you took a question yesterday about Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s comment about getting the oil companies, in his words, \xe2\x80\x9cto help ensure that the recovery that we\xe2\x80\x99re now seeing is not jeopardized by energy costs that get out of control.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What did you find out about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what, I would refer you to the Department of Agriculture.\xc2\xa0 I think what our approach has been is to, through the policies that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been describing several times now, to work with domestic oil and gas companies to ensure that more -- millions and millions of more acres are available -- millions of acres are available for exploration in the Gulf and in Alaska and other places.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe work with manufacturers in a variety of ways to ensure the smooth operation of a system here that provides oil and gas products to American consumers, but I don\'t think it was anything more specific than that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know of any specific concern --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a new effort to get them to try to put a lid on prices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 And I think that should not be interpreted that way.\xc2\xa0 I think this was more about the fact that we have a lot of consultation and dialogue to ensure that the overall system that produces and supplies American consumers is operating smoothly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Florida speech tomorrow, is he going to specifically address the current price situation?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any kind of reassurance for people in this speech, which apparently is going to focus on energy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he will talk about the need to take an all-of-the-above approach.\xc2\xa0 He will certainly talk about it broadly in terms of our energy security in the 21st century and our economic security in the 21st century as a long-term project. He\xe2\x80\x99ll, I expect, make reference to the rise in oil prices that we\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing right now and the anxiety that that creates and the impact that has on American families trying to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has been very clear about his concern about higher gas prices and higher oil prices, and what that means for American families.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been explicit about that in arguing for the payroll tax cut and the extra money that that provides to Americans both in 2011 and this year.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, I expect you can hear him -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President is going viral again by singing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is this by design?\xc2\xa0 Is it a reaction to polls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a hidden talent that we\xe2\x80\x99re just getting to hear.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not at all -- the circumstances both at the Apollo Theater and last night at the event here I think were pretty unique.\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t predict -- the next time maybe at the inauguration next year.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that among his --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of when.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It will be a celebration.\xc2\xa0 No matter -- among his many talents is the ability to carry a tune.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on corporate taxes, you could find any number of polls suggesting average Americans believe that corporations don\xe2\x80\x99t pay their fair share, that there are too many loopholes, too many breaks, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President make more of a show of this?\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he bang the drum a little bit about this issue when it could be politically positive for him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been pretty explicit about his firm belief that there are provisions within the tax code that allow some corporations to be subsidized in ways that are just not affordable and are unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 And I think oil and gas companies are a primary example and one that he\xe2\x80\x99s been beating the drum on for quite some time -- and that is included within this corporate tax reform proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t often been criticized for not speaking out on this issue because he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken out on it so clearly, and he will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about the carried interest rule and why that is simply bad policy and why it needs to be eliminated.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply not equitable if a hedge fund manager or a private equity executive pays tax on his or her income at a rate of 15 percent when average folks are paying much more.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense and it\xe2\x80\x99s not affordable.\xc2\xa0 We need to be fiscally responsible in our approach to the tax code.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach the President has taken in this corporate tax reform, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that guides his vision on taxes in general.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Kate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Democrats sent the President a letter today asking him to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this letter that you mention, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer that as I have in the past, which is I have no specific comments to make on that possibility.\xc2\xa0 We obviously examine every issue when it comes to higher oil and gas prices.\xc2\xa0 That was the case last year and continues to be the case.\xc2\xa0 And we take no possible response off the table, but I have no specific comment to make on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a price that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at, though?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I have no comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Buffett Rule -- back to the Buffett Rule, Governor Christie -- any response to his remarks that Warren Buffett should just \xe2\x80\x9cshut up and write a check\xe2\x80\x9d in a TV interview last night?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Mr. Buffett, who is widely regarded for his success in business as well as in philanthropy, has been quite outspoken, as is his right, on what he believes is an issue of tax fairness.\xc2\xa0 He simply believes, as one of the wealthiest men in the world, that he should not be paying an effective tax rate lower than his secretary.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why the governor mentioned or others think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea, but this President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think he should go ahead and write the check until that -- it becomes law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a quip that tries to draw attention away from what is a very serious issue, which is the need to have a tax code that\xe2\x80\x99s fair and that helps the American people as they recover from this recession, and helps us achieve the kind of balanced approach to deficit and debt reduction that this President has pursued for some time now.\xc2\xa0 So, quips aside, we think the Buffett Rule is absolutely an important principle to apply to individual tax reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rhetorically, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the energy policy, the President has had this ground-up, comprehensive energy policy.\xc2\xa0 But when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about tax reform, it seems like what\xe2\x80\x99s coming from the podium is that there are these piecemeal things, we can do this on corporate tax reform, there could be more -- you said earlier -- on individual reform, if the Congress is there for it.\xc2\xa0 Why is it not the same comprehensive, ground-up strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think first of all, the corporate tax reform framework that was laid out today is fairly detailed, A.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tB, if we could achieve some of these important policy objectives through executive action as the President did with close to a dozen automobile manufacturers in putting in place fuel efficiency standards that will save 12 billion barrels of oil, we would.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is that in order to achieve corporate tax reform or individual tax reform or balance deficit and debt reduction, we need to work with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And the way to do that is to put forward the kind of detailed framework that makes clear what this President\xe2\x80\x99s principles are, makes clear the path that he believes we need to take in reforming our tax code, and invite, as the Secretary of the Treasury has already done, Democrats and Republicans to work together to achieve that goal of lowering the rate, expanding the base, eliminating subsidies and loopholes, and creating incentives for American manufacturing and advanced manufacturing and small businesses to grow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier the President -- there was a statement from the President\xe2\x80\x99s office about observation of Ash Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Is the President doing anything in particular during Lenten season?\xc2\xa0 Is he giving anything up or is he doing anything special for it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that.\xc2\xa0 I believe we did put out a statement for Ash Wednesday today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:51 P.M.
