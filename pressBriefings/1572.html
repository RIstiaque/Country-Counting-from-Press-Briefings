GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s my never-ending pursuit to try to bring maybe a special guest once every day this week.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So just once a day.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you paying them?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Top dollar.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Before we get started, if you have PAYGO questions or want to talk about that, obviously Peter Orszag, OMB Director, will talk a little bit about PAYGO and take a few of your questions on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Glad to be here.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Today the administration is putting forward a statutory "pay as you go" proposal.\xc2\xa0 This is the same set of statutory rules that applied during the 1990s, an era in which we did restore fiscal discipline and move towards balanced budgets and then surpluses.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The rules are similar to rules that already exist in the House and Senate but are backed up by the power of law.\xc2\xa0 And you saw today the President standing with the House leadership, including the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, along with membership of the Blue Dogs and others, in support of this legislation, which we hope will be taken up quickly not only by the House, but also by the United States Senate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You want to take a few questions?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what Robert means -- that was easy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When he stands before the Budget Committee he\'s not nearly as quick to want to leave as with you guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, at Brookings this morning, you talked about health care being deficit-neutral and many other things.\xc2\xa0 Does the deficit neutrality of health care fit in with PAYGO?\xc2\xa0 Are they complementary?\xc2\xa0 And do you want PAYGO before the health care legislation passes so one comes before the other and that\'s the metric by which you have to fit the cost and spending into?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 First, the concepts are very similar, and we have said we need to be adopting a health care reform that is not only deficit-neutral, fully paid for, but that also moves toward a more efficient health care system and eliminates or starts to work at eliminating a lot of the variation that we see in the health care system where the higher cost areas don\'t generate better health outcomes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McAllen versus El Paso.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 In McAllen versus El Paso -- you were paying close attention.\xc2\xa0 The timing on the piece of legislation I\'m going to leave to others to discuss, but I think the core thing is the principle is exactly the same, which is in health care we are saying the proposal must be deficit-neutral, and that will occur in hard, scorable savings in terms of -- in CBO scoring.\xc2\xa0 And I would just note I know there has been some discussion about those offsets, but CBO -- which I used to run -- is appropriately skeptical of many types of health care interventions.\xc2\xa0 The package will be deficit-neutral based on that CBO scoring.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, again, I want to just emphasize if that\'s all we did we would be perpetuating lots of parts of the health care system that could be made more efficient, and so we need to go beyond that and adopt some of the things that may not score but that are crucial to a health care system that embodies best practices universally.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the administration come up with the other offsets to get to the portion that is currently not covered by your set-aside in the budget you are --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Down payment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Down payment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 The President, in a letter that was released last week, indicated that there will $200 billion to $300 billion more in savings that we will be putting out in the near future.\xc2\xa0 And if you put that together with the down payment you\'re in the range of the packages that are under discussion on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 We will work with the Congress to make sure that any remaining pieces are fully financed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, are there any exceptions to PAYGO?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 There are four, although you could collapse them into three exceptions that reflect I think -- there\'s an ongoing debate about current policy versus current law.\xc2\xa0 The thrust of current policy embodies, for example, an assumption that we\'re not going to allow the Alternative Minimum Tax to take over the tax code.\xc2\xa0 It embodies an assumption that at least a significant part of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will be extended past their scheduled expiration in 2010; and it embodies an assumption that we\'re not going to reduce physician payments by 20 percent arbitrarily in the near future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in those three areas, what we have done is we\'ve said, as long as legislation embodies sort of the thrust of current policy, it will neither count as a cost, nor as an offset in the PAYGO system.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s just, frankly, a reflection.\xc2\xa0 One of the problems that we have is we\'ve built so many sunsets into the tax code and into the -- so-called the sustainable growth rate formula under Medicare that there\'s this awkwardness between the technical law, which is implausible -- all of the tax cuts disappear, the physician payments are reduced by 20 percent, and what is commonly understood as policy as it currently stands.\xc2\xa0 Our legislation says let\'s take policy as it currently stands, and make sure that you have "pay as you go" off of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are emergency supplementals covered by PAYGO?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 PAYGO only applies to the mandatory side of the budget and to revenue, so a different set of issues surrounds discretionary spending, which is where the supplemental comes up in the budget.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, why apply it over a decade instead of year by year, as the President\'s budget proposal has proposed?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the reason is that when you apply it in some periods, you can easily get timing shifts and gaining that occurs, so we have not only an over 10-year period, but also a rule against shifting from the 11th year in and out of the 10th year.\xc2\xa0 So this is intended to make sure that timing shifts are not allowing the letter of the law to be met but the spirit being violated.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that in contradiction to what the President originally proposed?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of different "pay as you go" proposals that have been put forward.\xc2\xa0 There are existing Senate and House rules also.\xc2\xa0 And again, what we\'re trying to accomplish with that is an improvement that will avoid timing shifts being gained.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the original proposal just wasn\'t the best one to make?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 No, we didn\'t actually have a fully specific statutory PAYGO proposal that was fully laid out.\xc2\xa0 There are different ways of doing PAYGO, and we think this is an improvement on some previous versions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But following up on that, if you do it over 10 years, doesn\'t that allow you not to pay as you go for the early years in that 10-year period?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 You have to pay on average over the 10-year window.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but during those early years, for example, when we\'re paying for health care reform, you don\'t have to pay as you go?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 There are -- well, again, in addition to the statutory PAYGO, there are existing House and Senate rules that would require matching upfront costs and upfront offsets.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think one of the things that\'s happened in the past -- and you even saw this with regard to the 2001 and 2003 tax legislation when it was adopted -- is that you create gains by shifting costs in offsets across years.\xc2\xa0 And what we\'re trying to do is say, no more gamesmanship like that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, are you concerned about the fact that the House committees of jurisdiction on health care have put forward their ideas of how to spend the money but they still haven\'t said how they\'re going to pay for any of it?\xc2\xa0 And obviously just putting those important decisions off just leaves less time for conversation about this very matter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you saw the Finance Committees white paper, they have put forward ideas about how they could pay for it.\xc2\xa0 I think many of the details will be forthcoming over the next -- in the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 But I also think there is widespread agreement and recognition that the package will have to be deficit-neutral in order to be enacted.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but I\'m talking about specifically the House side at the moment.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t it have been more responsible to come and up say, if you\'re going to talk about spending money, talk about how you\'re going to pay for it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there\'s recognition that in the legislation as it emerges from the committees -- and you, again, have committee jurisdictional issues with different committees being responsible for different parts of the overall legislation, it will come together with both the coverage aspect and the offsets aspect being joined.\xc2\xa0 And then, again, I want to emphasize we not only have to make sure that we are expanding coverage in a fiscally responsible way, but if that\'s all we did, we would be perpetuating a system that has some issues with it where we could be doing a lot better.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, can you say just roughly -- I know you can\'t get real granular on this, but just roughly, what percentage of the federal budget will be subject to PAYGO rules?\xc2\xa0 Because when it comes to mandatory, the three big entitlement programs really don\'t fall under this; they can\'t be restrained under PAYGO rules.\xc2\xa0 Discretionary is another big chunk.\xc2\xa0 So it seems like at least, I don\'t know, 60, 70 percent of the federal budget isn\'t under PAYGO rules at all.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 No, let me \xe2\x80\x93- that is wrong.\xc2\xa0 So the only part that\'s not covered by PAYGO is the discretionary part of the budget, which is a little under 40 percent of the total.\xc2\xa0 So 60 percent is conceptually subject to PAYGO.\xc2\xa0 I guess you\'d have to take out the interest payments, which are not.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the exemptions that you may be hearing about have to do more with how the sequestration part of statutory PAYGO would work, in particular if, for example, the Congress adopted policies that cost more than the savings were, there would be an automatic sequestration that would apply to some programs, not all.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s where you would hear about the exemptions for Social Security, for Medicaid -- actually, Medicare is included there.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The sequestration rules are there.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t typically get triggered, because everyone knows that that would be a very bad outcome.\xc2\xa0 And so the very threat of that occurring means that it\'s not necessary to implement them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, those entitlements are going to continue to grow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so that\'s a separate question.\xc2\xa0 What this is doing is saying we can\'t dig the hole any deeper.\xc2\xa0 But as is well-recognized, all this does is prevent the hole from getting deeper, which, by the way, would be a significant accomplishment.\xc2\xa0 If you look back over the past eight years, what has happened is through the Medicare prescription drug benefit and other steps that we did not pay for we did make the hole deeper.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that would have been an example of something --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 That would have been an example of something that would have been subject to "pay as you go."</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Medicare Part D would have been under PAYGO?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, can you just elaborate a little on the sequestration?\xc2\xa0 It\'s my understanding that in the 1990s, those -- that provision was waived.\xc2\xa0 In other words, at the end of the year, CBO would score and Congress would just simply waive it.\xc2\xa0 So what does your proposal do to prevent that from happening in the future?\xc2\xa0 Is that how you\'re addressing it, with the 10 years, or what?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 There were some questions that arose at the very end of the decade with regard to how the rules operate in an era of surpluses.\xc2\xa0 So I guess all I would say is let\'s hope that we quickly return to having that kind of problem.\xc2\xa0 In an era of deficits --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were they never waived in an era of deficits?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 There were very few exceptions.\xc2\xa0 And again, waiving statutory PAYGO has a different set of rules associated with it than waiving the House and Senate rules that can be waived by a vote.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Conrad says that PAYGO can only do so much and that one of the problems that you have is you have to address the existing deficits and the rising debt.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering what your reaction and what your response to that is?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Well, I agree with that.\xc2\xa0 "Pay as you go" embodies the common-sense principle that you shouldn\'t dig the hole deeper.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t deal with the underlying hole, and that underlying hole, if you look out over the long term, is being driven mostly by rising Medicare and Medicaid costs.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one of the reasons why we want to act so aggressively to address the variation between McAllen versus El Paso and make the health care system more efficient -- because if we don\'t we are on an utterly unsustainable fiscal course.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">That\'s why we\'re trying to get health care done this year in a way that not only is deficit-neutral over the next five or 10 years, but also puts in place a lot of the structural changes that will lead to a more efficient health care system over time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the critics, though, say that the stimulus package and other measures show that you\'re not serious about really containing the deficit.</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have two deficits that we are grappling with.\xc2\xa0 One is the deficit in GDP, the gap between how much the economy could produce and how much it is producing, which estimates suggest amounted to roughly a trillion dollars a year when we came into office.\xc2\xa0 The very first priority was to try to start to address that, mitigate the sense of freefall in the economy, and start to boost economic growth again back up to what the potential of the economy is.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one issue, and that\'s something that is very paramount for the next year or two.</div> <div class="legacy-para">A separate issue is the budget deficits that then go out over time, not only in the next five or 10 years, but over the very long term.\xc2\xa0 And again at the heart of all that is health care.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the stimulus have fallen under PAYGO?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 No, the stimulus is in the discretionary part of the budget.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All part of the discretionary?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You seemed to suggest in the beginning that the surpluses of the 1990s were the result of PAYGO.\xc2\xa0 Do you really believe that PAYGO created -- I mean, wasn\'t that just the result of revenue coming in as a result of a strong economy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 I think there were a variety of forces that came together to create surpluses during the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 One of them was economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Another was a set of fiscal discipline tools that contributed to overall fiscal improvement.\xc2\xa0 So there were -- and frankly, then, there were a variety of other things, too, including the ending of the Cold War and a whole variety of other stuff.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So PAYGO would be miniscule --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- here\'s the thing.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I do strongly believe in the broken glass -- broken window theory of budgeting, which is, if you don\'t have any -- just like broken windows have been shown to increase crime and harm outcomes, if you don\'t have important constraints, including a basic principle that if you\'ve already got a hole you don\'t dig it deeper, which is what PAYGO embodies -- I think it leads to a sense that anything is possible in a fiscally irresponsible way, and undermines a lot of what we\'re trying to do.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was it the only thing that led to surpluses during the 1990s?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Did it contribute to a sense of fiscal discipline that helped to generate the surpluses?\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you reply to those who say, well, you just dug the hole really deep, and now you\'re announcing that we want to stop digging?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s look at what that hole was.\xc2\xa0 We came into office, we faced this massive GDP gap, a deficit that was already projected to be in excess of a trillion dollars, and the need to address a crisis in the financial system and a deep economic hole.\xc2\xa0 All of the deficit this year relates to the severity of the economic recession and to the steps that were deemed necessary to address it.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, let\'s look out over time.\xc2\xa0 And again, we are applying this "pay as you go" principle not only to health care reform but to other things that we are doing.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not only that we haven\'t made anything worse on that long-term and medium-term deficit, but to the extent that we succeed in wringing more efficiencies out of the health care system, I think we will have taken the single most important step we could to address the core driver of our long-term deficits.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a political level, how will this make it easier for you or for the Congress to come to an agreement about how to pay for health care?\xc2\xa0 In other words, how does this contribute to the end goal of figuring that out?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 I think let\'s separate the statutory PAYGO from the PAYGO principle applied to health care.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the key point.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The PAYGO principle applied to health care is not only something the President believes in strongly, but it\'s also embodied in the rules that already apply in the Senate and the House.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\'t -- I think it\'s worth distinguishing between those two --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- under reconciliation --</div> <div

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you proposing that as a --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not the one that has legislative power.</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 This is fun.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying Medicare Part B is a major deficit problem.\xc2\xa0 Where\'s the proposal to take it away?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Can I make this point --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Peter outlines that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Over the next two months, two to three months, we will be in the midst of a legislative process on the core fiscal problem facing the United States.\xc2\xa0 If we succeed -- I mean, for example, here\'s a calculation for you:\xc2\xa0 If we succeed in reducing the growth rate of health care spending by 15 basis points, 0.15 percent points per year, that has a larger impact on the nation\'s fiscal imbalance than eliminating the Social Security deficit.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And so what I\'m trying to say is we need to be focusing on whether we are doing as much as we can to get that number down 15 basis points, 30 basis points, 100 basis points, 150 basis points.\xc2\xa0 And then in addition, as the President has said, once we get -- once we address the biggest problem that we face over the long term, we do need to turn to other parts of our long-term fiscal imbalance, including Social Security.\xc2\xa0 But it strikes me as making sense to focus on the thing that is the core driver first, and we\'re going to have plenty of discussion over the next two months about ways of trying to obtain a more efficient health care system.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So health care first, then entitlement reform?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Well, health care --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Health care includes some entitlement reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 It includes a lot.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again -- look, if health care costs grow at the same rate over the next four decades as they did over the past four decades, Medicare and Medicaid go from 5 percent of the economy today to 20 percent of the economy by 2050.\xc2\xa0 That is the core driver of our entitlement problem.\xc2\xa0 If we succeed in bending that curve we will have done more to improve the long-term fiscal health of the nation than any other single thing we could do -- which is not to say other things aren\'t important, but what I\'m saying is over the next two months we have an opportunity, our best shot at addressing that problem and that\'s what we want to do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter, on that point, how could the stimulus not apply? How could PAYGO not apply to stimulus?\xc2\xa0 Even if you save hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare, then you turn around and spend $787 billion on the stimulus, doesn\'t that wipe out a lot of our savings?</div> <div class="legacy-para">DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, the present value of the Medicare and Medicaid imbalance is many, many orders of magnitude larger.\xc2\xa0 But remember what the Recovery Act was intended to do.\xc2\xa0 As I said before, we have these two deficits.\xc2\xa0 We needed to address the GDP gap -- the gap between how much we could produce and how much we are producing -- and there is widespread agreement that the key driver of that is that there is not adequate demand for how much firms could produce with their existing plants and equipment.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re trying to do through the Recovery Act is get the economy back on its feet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PAYGO does not apply to that part of the budget which is the discretionary part of the budget.\xc2\xa0 And furthermore, even if it did, it would be viewed as the kind of short-term economic situation in which the rules would typically be waived.\xc2\xa0 But I think the more important thing is there is widespread mainstream economic agreement that in the midst of a severe economic downturn, temporarily running larger budget deficits is not only something that you should accept, it is actually desirable because it helps to get the economy back on its feet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the economy recovers, deficits become a problem.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we are trying to act to address -- coming back to Jake\'s question -- what we see as the key driver of our long-term deficits even while we\'re fighting the short-term economic problem in which temporarily elevated deficits are unfortunately necessary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we\'re educating the public here on PAYGO, why shouldn\'t discretionary spending be under PAYGO rules?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 There\'s a wonky reason, which is that discretionary spending is just addressed year by year by the Congress, and so the rules are different.\xc2\xa0 What happened in the 1990s was a separate set of constraints were applied to discretionary spending called discretionary caps.\xc2\xa0 They just -- I guess the short answer is it just -- the legislative process is different for mandatory spending and revenue than it is the appropriation bills.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\'t the cynical watcher out here sit there and say, okay, it\'s "pay as you go," unless it\'s not?\xc2\xa0 You know, it\'s like you have this discretionary pot here; well, we don\'t have to follow budgetary "pay as you go" rules, but over here we do.\xc2\xa0 You see what I\'m saying?\xc2\xa0 How do you reconcile --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s come back to things like the prescription drug benefit.\xc2\xa0 That is a mandatory program.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t decide upon that year by year.\xc2\xa0 And "pay as you go" would have applied to it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So year-by-year pay-as-you-go budgeting?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So year-by-year pay-as-you-go budgeting just doesn\'t --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DIRECTOR ORSZAG:\xc2\xa0 The appropriations process goes through the discretionary part of the budget each year.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just a different system than is used for Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and revenue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to get into hypotheticals about how certain cases may or may not play out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not willing to commit to freeing people if they\'re found not guilty?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not willing to get into playing hypothetical games.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a game, Robert.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a question about the credibility of the justice system.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s the principle of it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s -- I\'m not debating legal principles.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just not getting into the hypothetical back-and-forth of what happens on a case.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So the Obama administration is refusing to say that if somebody is found not guilty they will be set free?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\'m not going to get into hypotheticals about specific outcomes of cases.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not asking you to talk about a specific case.\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about in general --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for all the detainees brought into this system of justice, which the administration said can and has in the past handled adequately -- more than adequately, according to your talking points this morning -- the terrorism cases brought before it in whatever venue -- if that justice system, which the administration says should be trusted, renders a verdict of not guilty, is that person released?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We will talk about what happens about a verdict when a verdict comes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then how is the world supposed to have any confidence that this new system of justice that you guys are ensuring is going to be the case with the detainees is actually credible?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We think the Southern District of New York has a very good record as it relates to trying and convicting terror suspects.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe what you\'re -- the fact sheet said this morning was that it has a 90-percent success rate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think 90 is pretty good.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not questioning whether 90 is pretty good; I\'m asking about the 10 percent.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m, in this specific case, not going to get into those hypotheticals.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other question I have has to do with the $68 billion that\'s going to be paid back in TARP money.\xc2\xa0 Herb Allison, your nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability, told the Senate Banking Committee that that money might be used to provide more assistance to troubled firms.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the money goes back into general revenue. I think the way the statute for TARP is written is that the amount obligated can\'t exceed the amount of $700 billion.\xc2\xa0 But again, this money goes back into general revenue.\xc2\xa0 It\'s our obvious hope that additional money is not going to have to be used to stabilize banks.\xc2\xa0 I think the result in the past several weeks at the conclusion of the most recent round of stress tests denoted that banks have been very capable at raising private capital in order to ensure that they meet regulator requirements for capital cushions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it could be used?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On Iraq and Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 Yes, there are approximately 21,000 additional troops in Afghanistan and a plan to remove all combat brigades from Iraq, unlike the previous administration.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s the difference?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the request for additional troops had been sitting on the desk of somebody either in this building or in a certain five-sided building for quite some time without additional -- without that additional request being met.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'re bragging about that?\xc2\xa0 The President bragged about not -- (laughter) --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Now, come on, Helen, you asked me what the difference was.\xc2\xa0 I said more troops, and then you said, well, so you -- my answer means I\'m bragging.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean, you asked me to outline the factual differences between --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President bragged about being against Iraq.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Pardon me?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President bragged about being against Iraq -- about the invasion.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President denoted that he spoke out in opposition to that war.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not bragging --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish my answer, Helen.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not bragging -- I\'m not bragging -- I don\'t know why we would brag that we\'ve put 21,000 people -- I think what the President did, and he said throughout the campaign and he\'s done as Commander-in-Chief in the four or so months that we\'ve been here is resource the war in Afghanistan in a way that meets the seriousness of that effort, that for quite some time we saw --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think people were not serious?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We think that additional troops were required in order to stabilize a security situation that was deteriorating greatly.\xc2\xa0 I think that has been largely proven by the fact that everybody on the ground said that situation was deteriorating.\xc2\xa0 The President said he would meet that deteriorating situation with a greater commitment of resources -- not just military but also -- as well and through the use of civil society in ensuring that we\'re doing stuff to stabilize and increase and grow the economy there; and that we\'re undertaking significant gestures of aid to ensure stabilization there as well as in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many people are dying and many people are being killed, and we\'re killing people there.\xc2\xa0 And you haven\'t explained why.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve discussed the severe tragedy involved in civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve seen some remarkable gestures recently in our new ambassador there accompanying the leadership of Afghanistan to the site of some of those horrible and tragic mistakes -- none of which anybody wants to see.\xc2\xa0 But, Helen, there are people in Afghanistan and in the border region that are planning to do this country harm, just as they planned to do this country harm in the lead-up to September 11.\xc2\xa0 The President said --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What proof do you have of that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helen, you and I should just go in the Situation Room and we can have somebody explain it to you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we go, too?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 One-person invitation.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, Mark -- she\'ll pool it for you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Chrysler, the Supreme Court review, any concern here that maybe the President overstepped his authority, didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear out the bondholders?\xc2\xa0 What\'s your response to this review?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because I -- one of the interesting things is some of the bondholders involved in the very case were some of the bondholders that accepted the offer just a few weeks ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Look, we understand this is part of the process.\xc2\xa0 People are entitled to press their case.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\'s important -- we\'re certainly hopeful that the outcome will be handed down fairly quickly.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think there is a sense of urgency here.\xc2\xa0 I understand that our options outside of what we\'ve proposed are extremely limited.\xc2\xa0 The actions that this administration has taken now have kept plants opened, have saved jobs in those communities, and has kept the vast majority of dealerships open.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the best chance for these jobs to be maintained and for this company to survive is through the restructuring process that the Auto Task Force has admirably done.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'ve talked about in here concern that people have had about dealerships, decisions that were made by Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 The decision made by Chrysler maintains 75 percent in the sheer number of dealerships, representing 87 percent of the cars that are sold by Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 Understand -- and I think it\'s important for people to understand -- that\'s 75 percent more than would be operating if a sale were to fall through and liquidation was to happen; that the effects of liquidation would be severe and profound.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We believe, as I said, that the structure that we have put Chrysler on when it comes out of the sale represents the best chance to ensure viability for Chrysler, to see the investment that has previously been made by taxpayers to have a chance to recoup some of that money.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the best opportunity going forward.\xc2\xa0 And understand that delay in this situation means that it already costs the taxpayers additional financing during this time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow on something else, the CIA interrogation tapes.\xc2\xa0 Why is the administration trying to block the release of the Bush-era documents on the CIA interrogation tapes, when previously you released Bush-era memos and said you didn\'t really have a national security concern about it because these methods were already out there, the media had reported on it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but understand -- I think if you look at particularly at some of the memos that were released, you see that there was some redaction taken to ensure highly sensitive information.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a great amount of the information contained in those memos were known by your network and others, and have been for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve been in the media, they\'ve been in books; the people in the previous administration have written communications back and forth involved in some of these cables.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t redact that information.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what it is.\xc2\xa0 The President believes, the administration believes that that material is highly sensitive.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the CIA is saying that this could be a recruiting tool for al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Haven\'t you said previously the President has been removing recruiting tools by ending torture to begin with?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and that was one of the reasons that the larger framework of those memos -- again, those tactics were -- I\'ve used this example with you before -- the graphic that you all had about waterboarding wasn\'t a graphic that was created after the release and the reading of these memos.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been something that\'s been discussed, my guess is, for many, many hours on your network.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Jennifer\'s question, you\'re already getting pushback or you or Pat Leahy is already getting pushback on that July 13th date.\xc2\xa0 Jon Kyl said that she has 10 times as many cases as Roberts had.\xc2\xa0 Now there\'s a statement from the Republicans in the Senate saying that it would take 76 -- you\'d have to read 76 cases per day of her record, compared to six cases per day of the Roberts record.\xc2\xa0 They\'re also noting that Alito took 70 days, Robert then but 48 days.\xc2\xa0 So they\'re just pulling out everything they can here, it looks like, to make the argument that this date is not going to work.\xc2\xa0 What can the President do to keep this on track?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to get involved or is this just up to Pat Leahy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the date -- the hearing date has been set.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but they can drag their feet.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of things Republicans can do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t think -- I honestly don\'t think that\'s the course that many would want to go down.\xc2\xa0 She seems to -- my hunch is that the average isn\'t actually 76, because it appears, based on some of the questions from in here, some people in the Republican Party have read some of those cases.\xc2\xa0 That might decrease the average by a few.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were suggestions that this hearing should take place after Labor Day.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll pull out another statistic to go -- you can e-mail them then.\xc2\xa0 The statistic -- if we wait until after Labor Day to have a hearing, that would actually be the longest amount of time ever for a Supreme Court nominee, from the announcement of the nomination to the beginning of the hearing.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody thinks that\'s a good idea.\xc2\xa0 The information that -- the cases that she\'s been involved with, the opinions that she\'s written are publicly available.\xc2\xa0 She\'s been confirmed by the Senate on two occasions, most recently in 1998.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my sense is there are a number of people on that committee and a number of people that continue to serve in the Senate that have a pretty firm understanding and relationship with a lot that she\'s written in the past.\xc2\xa0 We think this is eminently doable, though we appreciate the notion that she represents a justice that has experience unlike anybody that\'s been nominated in a hundred years.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But since this time schedule is so important to the President, is it in his interest to reach out to these Republicans and talk to them personally about why --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that members of the Senate have talked to -- Democratic members have talked to Republican members.\xc2\xa0 Our belief is that this hearing can be done in this time frame.\xc2\xa0 We talked about the very important work that happens in September as the Court decides the exact nature of the cases that it\'s going to take up in the coming term, how important that work is.\xc2\xa0 We think that whether it\'s 48 or 51, it\'s certainly eminently doable in that time frame, and the President looks forward to that hearing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any additional information on the bombing in Pakistan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I -- I saw it before I came out there, but I don\'t have anything from NSC.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, let\'s go to our friend Joe in Kansas City; reconcile --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several different things.\xc2\xa0 One, and I think we did talk about this yesterday -- I don\'t know if Joe was watching -- but in order to get this economy moving again, exactly what Peter talked about, the decrease in demand of what this economy could be producing.\xc2\xa0 If Joe works at a -- if Joe is the manager at a good steak restaurant, my sense is that people are eating out fewer days in the week, because this economy has slowed down. Increasing the demand for this economy, putting money back into people\'s pockets through a tax cut that 95 percent of working families are going to do, my sense is they may just spend it at some of that at Joe\'s steakhouse.\xc2\xa0 But in order to get this economy moving again, we\'re going to have to spur that demand.\xc2\xa0 I think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So yesterday it was about deficits; today it\'s not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'m just saying, how is it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, today is not about deficits?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today is not about -- today is about how you\'re not going to have deficits, you\'re going to pay as you go.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday was about how --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if Joe is confused, but I think I am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s the -- how do you deal with that confusion of, yesterday you\'re talking about how much money you\'re going to spend and all of this deficit spending that you\'re forced to do, and Peter just described it as a second deficit, which --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let\'s get -- I mean, again, let\'s use the example of somebody that works in Kansas City at a restaurant, or owns a restaurant or manages a restaurant.\xc2\xa0 Again, likely that they\'ve seen fewer and fewer people decide they want to eat out because the economy is bad, right?\xc2\xa0 So we want to increase demand.\xc2\xa0 We want to spur the economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just like Joe probably -- let\'s say Joe is going to send a kid to college.\xc2\xa0 Joe is going to make an investment in the long-term future through the education of Joe Jr.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re making investments that will create a foundation for long-term economic growth so that the economy improves, that people have more money to spend and go to Joe\'s restaurant.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you feel like you\'re not going to lose any credibility -- with the fact that -- everything goes under "pay as you go"?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but, again, I think the examples that Peter used about "pay as you go" in the \'90s -- I think the example that Peter used -- we had economics representing conservative and liberal viewpoints that understood that we needed an economic recovery plan to get this economy moving.\xc2\xa0 I think Joe probably understands that better than anybody because he\'s likely felt the downturn in that economy.\xc2\xa0 Is that good enough for Joe?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can ask Joe.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President has decided that there are things that have to be done to get this economy moving again; that we have to address the long-term costs of health care, making it affordable for small businesses and for families, laying the predicate for and the foundation for long-term economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Those are the things that have to be done.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, a recovery plan is a temporary stimulus plan to increase the demand in our economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, following up on our conversation with Peter, could you address the central question that kept coming back, which is that all the exceptions that are involved with PAYGO, including for discretionary spending, there aren\'t the same caps that existed in the \'90s, and there are a lot of exceptions to things that would apply, and there is already a lot of criticism of that -- so could you just sort of address how this is to be taken as a truly serious proposal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think -- I think I\'d leave most of that to what Peter said.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a serious proposal because we don\'t have it now; we\'re digging that -- we\'ve dug that hole deeper.\xc2\xa0 We need to take steps to put ourselves back on a path toward fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 The President has a budget that cuts the deficit in half in four years, and, as Peter tried in his answers to discuss, quite clearly what needs to be done in order to ensure that our long-term and medium-term Medicare costs don\'t swamp the economy, and that we do something about families that are facing the rising costs of health care each day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did I hear him right, that the President will be outlining the $200 billion to $300 billion in additional Medicare savings in this meeting?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s going to discuss it.\xc2\xa0 I think larger and more detail will come in, as he said, in the near future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he discussing the general idea of it or is he giving specifics of --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think when we\'re ready to give the full detail we\'ll do it as part of an event, rather than through some group.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do it just --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I\'m trying to clarify, whether you\'re --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Whether you need to follow the Ways and Means members when you get out of here or whether you can just go write your story?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might it be Thursday in Green Bay?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe it will be, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The answer to that is that he\'s not detailing it or he may be --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to discuss some of it, but full details will be done, as Peter said, in the near future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in answer to Jake you said the $68 billion in payback might be used again.\xc2\xa0 The President made it sound like it\'s coming off the national debt and it\'s not going to be used again -- at least that\'s how it sounds to me.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this goes into general -- this goes back into a general revenue fund.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then it doesn\'t come off the debt.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me double-check with the Treasury guys on this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify that.\xc2\xa0 It goes into general revenue -- by general revenue, that\'s more general than the TARP.\xc2\xa0 So basically if it were to be used for TARP again it has to be reallocated or reappropriated.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that there\'s a separate TARP account -- I know there\'s certainly an authorization and an appropriation, but I think it\'s not necessarily like a savings account-type thing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Treasury officials have said that it could be used again for another bank that needed help.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re going to check on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related to that, would the administration, since it\'s in a position the previous administration was not, where some of this money is coming back, be open to -- I don\'t want to get into all the budget terminology of the 1990s -- but a lockbox or something that would be transparent -- (laughter) -- and visible to taxpayers --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They groaned, not me, Major.\xc2\xa0 I just -- let the transcript reflect --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I prefaced it by saying I didn\'t want to revisit all the budget talks of the \'90s.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- want to play now?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was your shot.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m emailing him now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check on this.\xc2\xa0 I think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- where it wouldn\'t automatically go back to general revenue, but it would be appraised -- as the President said, there would --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- let me get a -- I think there is a far more technical answer regarding --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure there is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- and I heard parts of this about score ability, and it\'s innumerably more complicated than that.\xc2\xa0 I do think what\'s important -- let me tell you this, Major, I do think what\'s important and in part of this is that this money -- one, I think it\'s important that people understand and -- just understand the concept -- Washington tends to want to know what you\'re going to do with the money next.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I do think it\'s important to underscore for people that the program has been run in a way that the money has been paid back.\xc2\xa0 The money has been paid back with some interest.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is something that the American people can be happy about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the congressional assessment the stress tests were too light?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That didn\'t seem to be the prevailing opinion in the months leading up to it.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the regulators set out a series of tests that they believed adequately outlined the possible deteriorating conditions in the economy, and I think there\'s a certain amount of confidence that can be gained in the notion that -- or by the concept that these banks raised that money in a private way in order to make up the cushions that regulators believed they needed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the conditions outlined are in some cases worse now than they were asked to apply themselves to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think certainly -- I think the administration is confident in the tests that were conducted.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Chip\'s question, we talked yesterday about Judge Sotomayor\'s repeated use of this term "better" and you said, well, you really need to evaluate the entire judicial record to understand the context and the way she would approach cases.\xc2\xa0 Taking your comments yesterday, that would include, I would imagine, all 13,000 opinions, would it not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the White House believes that the time allotted between now and July 13th gives all interested parties adequate time at whatever rate -- 76, 70, 50 cases a day -- to review that record, and there\'s nothing inconsistent with asking them to evaluate the whole record, not her speeches, and doing all that by July 13th?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think it\'s inconsistent.\xc2\xa0 In fact, in the questionnaire that was sent to the Senate in 1997, upon her nomination for the judgeship that she has now contains one of the speeches that you all in this room have alluded to.\xc2\xa0 That nomination sat -- that questionnaire was sent up in 1997.\xc2\xa0 And as you all know in your reporting of it, that nomination sat in the Senate for a year.\xc2\xa0 And do you know how many questions were asked about that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember any -- having been at the Senate around that time, I don\'t remember any.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Rhymes with "none."\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but my question wasn\'t about that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.\xc2\xa0 I was walking you through a totally different point.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you answer my question instead of answering the one you\'ve been paid to answer?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s called "comment as you go."\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you answer my question --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did in saying I think that -- I think that, again, I think there are many members that have been there -- were there for her most recent confirmation in 1998.\xc2\xa0 I think she -- as I said, she\'s been confirmed twice by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that adequate time -- there is adequate time between her nomination and the beginning of her hearing to go through her legal opinions, her statements.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the questionnaire was sent to the Senate in a record time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, how much did the government make on this $68 billion --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s -- it\'s either $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was profit?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously money is loaned at an interest rate and paid back with that accrued interest.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In regards to Ghailani, some critics have said that the administration is essentially bypassing Congress by approving this transfer because of the theory about having people come from Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your response to that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President outlined in January, in signing the executive order, that he would seek swift and certain justice for those at Guantanamo Bay that we could try either in military commissions, through Article III or federal courts, and outlined this specific example in the speech that he gave a couple weeks ago at the Archives relating to our policy in closing Guantanamo Bay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is somebody, to keep in mind, who\'s been indicted with 286 separate counts relating to the death of 224 people, 12 Americans, in a crime that was committed 11 years ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that the victims -- the families of the victims that were involved have waited far too long for justice to be served. The President outlined a plan to bring justice, and that\'s what he is doing in this case.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I saw somebody say -- I saw somebody say this was a hasty decision.\xc2\xa0 This crime occurred in 1998, not during the last administration but the administration before that.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion of getting on with this case is far from hasty.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just a follow-up on Chuck\'s question.\xc2\xa0 The President has very high approval ratings, but the only two areas where he doesn\'t have a majority are the areas of the spending and the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Do you think an event like the one he did today can change that perception?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is going to make decisions about the course of our economy and fiscal responsibility not based on the number in some public poll, but instead by what he thinks is important to get our economy moving again, to lay that foundation for long term economic growth and to ensure that we\'re taking the steps that are necessary to put ourselves back on a path toward fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 Today\'s event was not about some number that popped up in some poll.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying that was the purpose of it; I\'m just saying people seem to not agree that he is being fiscally responsible, and wondering if this kind of thing that you did today could correct their misimpression, if you think --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
