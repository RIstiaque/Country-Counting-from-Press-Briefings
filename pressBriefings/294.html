Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>*Please see below for corrections and clarifications, marked with asterisks.</p>\n<p>12:48 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all today.\xc2\xa0 I did want to do a quick thing before we get started.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to call to your attention once again a couple of other climate-related announcements from the administration today.</p>\n<p>The first is that NOAA today released a floor risk mapping tool that allows communities to map their location and add layers to visualize the impacts of different flood scenarios on their populations and infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 This is a tool that was originally developed for New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 And today it\xe2\x80\x99s been expanded to cover coastal areas up and down the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>This is, again, an example of the administration working closely with state and local officials using data that\xe2\x80\x99s compiled by the federal government to help communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing I want to direct your attention to is the announcement from the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, all of whom are collaborating on four landscape partnerships.\xc2\xa0 These are areas in southwest Florida, Hawaii, Washington and the Great Lakes region.\xc2\xa0 The selected lands and waters face a wide range of climate-related impacts, including sea level rise, drought, wildfire and invasive species.\xc2\xa0 The federal agencies that I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned will work closely with state, tribal and local partners to prepare for and prevent these threats and ensure that long-term conservation efforts take climate change into account.</p>\n<p>This is an example of how the administration can continue to advance what we consider to be and what the world considers to be a top priority, which is dealing with the impacts of climate change in a way that makes communities more resilient in the face of climate change, but also can take some steps that will contribute to public safety and public health.\xc2\xa0 This is also evidence of how the administration can make progress in these priorities, even in the face of pretty significant opposition from Republicans in Congress.</p>\n<p>And so the President will obviously have more to say on these matters tomorrow at the event that he will host in the Everglades.</p>\n<p>So with all that, Julie, do you want to get us started with questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask on the deal, on the trafficking bill on the Hill that appears like it will clear the way for a vote on Loretta Lynch.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the outcome on the Hill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie, we at this point have not seen the final language of this compromise, but reports indicate that both Democrats and Republicans have agreed upon the language.\xc2\xa0 Support for the language appears to come also from senators like Patty Murray, who is a longstanding champion for women\xe2\x80\x99s access to health care.\xc2\xa0 So that certainly is an encouraging sign, but we haven\'t yet taken a look at the language.</p>\n<p>We are hopeful -- though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen tangible agreement -- that after the passage of the human trafficking bill, if the compromise holds up, that the Senate will promptly turn their attention to the nomination of Loretta Lynch.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly would use this opportunity to encourage them once again, after 164 days of delay, to move forward as quickly as possible with her confirmation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the risk of getting into another back-and-forth like we did last week over the Iran deal -- because you haven\'t seen the language on this, can you say whether or not the President would sign a trafficking bill that appears to have the agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the Hill in it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if we see strong Democratic support, including from champions for women\xe2\x80\x99s health care, like Patty Murray, then that certainly seems like the kind of thing that the President would be able to support.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously make a final determination about that once we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the language.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you were asked about this yesterday, but you weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to comment on it.\xc2\xa0 This Navy ship that\xe2\x80\x99s been sent toward Yemen to possibly try to intercept Iranian arms shipments -- can you give us any more context on why this ship was sent there, and what their mission is, what their orders are?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The principal goal of this operation is to maintain freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a region of the world where significant commerce takes place.\xc2\xa0 This includes energy shipments, but other goods that move through this area of the world both as they transit the Red Sea into the Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are significant European markets.\xc2\xa0 There are also obviously important markets on the other side of the Gulf of Aden as well.</p>\n<p>So this military presence -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 The movement of this particular aircraft carrier would augment the American military presence in the Gulf of Aden and would send a clear signal about our continued insistence about the free flow of commerce and the freedom of movement in the region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they were also sent there to presumably block any Iranian shipment of arms that were heading towards Yemen, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to have concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for the Houthis, including supplying them with military equipment even arms.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear both publicly and privately our concerns about their continued support.\xc2\xa0 And the concern that we have is because the conflict there has led to significant violence and an urgent humanitarian situation, but also because the instability in that country is only going to be solved around the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging all parties to the dispute to put down weapons and to engage in a U.N.-led process to try to resolve their differences politically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. given Iran any heads-up that this aircraft carrier was going to be positioned there, either directly to the Iranians or through a third party?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any communications with Iranians to convey to you at this point.\xc2\xa0 But I think this is a clear statement about our commitment to ensuring the free flow of commerce in this important region of the world.</p>\n<p>Again, this is not the first sign of a U.S. presence in this region.\xc2\xa0 The aircraft carrier is just the latest in a deployment of personnel and assets to this region of the world, again, in pursuit of this goal, which is the free flow of commerce in this important region of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just finally, CBS has a report that the DEA administrator is expect to resign.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm whether she either has resigned or is expected to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements from here, but I\xe2\x80\x99d direct you to the Department of Justice where the DEA is housed, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And they may be able to provide you some more information.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President continue to have confidence in the DEA chief?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we went through a little bit last week.\xc2\xa0 We continue to have concerns about the material that was presented in the IG report that raised legitimate and serious questions about the conduct of some DEA officers.</p>\n<p>The President, as you know, maintains a very high standard for anybody who serves in his administration, particularly when it comes to law enforcement officials.\xc2\xa0 And the IG report raised serious concerns about that conduct.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- that\'s, frankly, all I have to say about the DEA at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to Yemen for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Saudi\xe2\x80\x99s King today ordered the Saudi national guard to take part in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House has a reaction to this.\xc2\xa0 And does it mean that ground forces are going to be involved?\xc2\xa0 And is that something that the White House supports?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that -- I had not seen that comment from the King.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you as a general matter that the United States is supportive of the ongoing efforts by the Saudis to try to resolve some of the security concerns that they have along their southern border.\xc2\xa0 They\'re engaged in military operations with the support of many of their GCC partners in the region.\xc2\xa0 And the United States, at the request of the Saudis, has provided some logistical and intelligence support for that ongoing effort.</p>\n<p>As a part of offering that support, we also continue to be in close contact with military officials in Saudi Arabia, and that close coordination and communication will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the White House have any reaction to Mohamed Morsi being sentenced to 20 years in prison without parole in Egypt?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of those reports, as well.\xc2\xa0 The United States is concerned by these sentences.\xc2\xa0 All Egyptians, regardless of political affiliation, are entitled to equal and fair treatment before the law, including full respect for their rights to due process.</p>\n<p>Now, we won\xe2\x80\x99t have extensive comment on this until we\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to review the verdict and the basis of the verdict, which we understand the Egyptian judicial authorities will make public soon.</p>\n<p>That being said, Mr. Morsi, like all other defendants, must be afforded the basic legal right of due process.\xc2\xa0 And the United States continues to be strongly opposed to politicized arrests and detentions.\xc2\xa0 The United States will also continue to engage the Egyptian government on its political trajectory, and to raise human rights and political reform issues.\xc2\xa0 There should be no doubt that these issues remain significant bilateral priorities for the United States.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around.\xc2\xa0 Bob.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on the Arabian Sea situation, are our ships there in a sense to flex muscle, thump the chest a little bit?\xc2\xa0 Will they be able to board any Iranian-flagged vessel if they want to?\xc2\xa0 Or is that going to be left up to the other nations there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The principal -- again, the principal purpose of this military deployment is to protect the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce both in the Gulf of Aden and in the Red Sea.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I should also point out is that just last week, the international community came together at the United Nations and imposed an arms embargo on key Houthi leaders, as well as former President Saleh, his son, and all those who are acting at their direction.\xc2\xa0 And any effort by Iran or anyone else to provide weapons to the Houthis would be a clear violation not just of this United Nations Security Council resolution, but of previous U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iranian weapons shipments.</p>\n<p>So we obviously are concerned about the situation there.\xc2\xa0 And again, it stems from a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s long history of destabilizing activities in this region of the world.\xc2\xa0 The second is the impact that this continued instability and violence is having on a terrible humanitarian situation in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 The third is we continue to be concerned about the political instability in this country.\xc2\xa0 And this instability is not going to be addressed and resolved militarily; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require all sides to sit down at the negotiating table.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s also remember what the chief U.S. interest is in this region of the world, which is not allowing extremists like AQAP to capitalize on the instability and chaos in a region to establish a safe haven and plot attacks against the United States and our allies around the world.</p>\n<p>So we have a pretty clear set of priorities and interests.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re working closely with our partners to try to address them, both through the U.N., in this particular U.N. Security Council resolution, but also our partners in Saudi Arabia that also have their own significant security interest in Yemen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that a yes to the question of whether the United States would be able to feel free to board Iranian vessels, flagged vessels?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on this on that particular matter at this point.\xc2\xa0 But what I would do is just indicate that there is a military -- a U.S. military presence in the Gulf of Aden to ensure the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce both in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\xc2\xa0 And that is the principal goal of that mission.\xc2\xa0 And again, that is not a new mission.\xc2\xa0 There has been a U.S. military contingent -- a U.S. naval contingent in that region of the world for some time, but it is being augmented by the Roosevelt aircraft carrier.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that answer vague by design?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be as explicit as I can about what the chief goal of this deployment is.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what is it that threatens the freedom of commerce in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden to such an extent that the existing American deployment had to be ramped up --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to be concerned about the broader political instability in that region.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing, that you essentially have a Yemeni central government that\xe2\x80\x99s been rendered pretty ineffective in terms of being able to provide for security off the waters of their coast.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re having a lot of trouble with the security situation in their country.</p>\n<p>Second, we obviously continue to be concerned about the destabilizing activities of the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of that as we carry out this deployment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m not up on my Yemen navy statistics, but it seems like unrest in Yemen wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily carry over to this extent in the waters off Yemen that you would need to send an aircraft carrier and another warship there to augment the existing force, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the goal here is to -- well, let me start by saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t think even prior to this latest round of instability that there was a lot of bullish confidence in the strength and capability of the Yemeni navy.\xc2\xa0 But we are pretty eyes wide open when it comes to the efforts that some may engage in to capitalize on the instability in Yemen in a variety of ways, and that includes interfering with the freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce through this key navigational channel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the way that the violence and instability in Yemen could have an impact on all of that.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is not a new U.S. military presence, but rather a presence that\xe2\x80\x99s being augmented by the Roosevelt.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then this is sort of a follow-up on my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the rules of engagement, does the United States consider that an Iranian ship heading into Yemeni waters is necessarily conveying weapons and therefore subject to enforcement of the international community\xe2\x80\x99s arms embargo?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on any sort of future activities, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have parameters for this, I assume.\xc2\xa0 I realize you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about a future possible confrontation or incident, or whatever, but you must have existing rules on the books now for how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to treat those.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that there are.\xc2\xa0 And so for detailed questions about the rules of engagement, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But I would say, as a general matter, that we have been concerned about Iranian support and weapons shipments to the Houthis.\xc2\xa0 And we are -- when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the international community is serious about the strict enforcement of a United Nations Security Council resolution that has placed an embargo of weapons shipments to the Houthis, to President Saleh, to his son, and to others who are taking directions from them.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when the President ordered the Roosevelt there, did he give it a mandate to assist in the enforcement of that U.N. Security Council resolution?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The specific mandate and the specific mission of the Roosevelt is to ensure the free flow of commerce and the freedom of navigation in this region of the world.\xc2\xa0 That is their specific mandate.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to be mindful of the destabilizing activities that Iran has engaged in in terms of supporting the Houthis and, in some cases, even supplying them weapons.\xc2\xa0 And the United States is serious in standing shoulder to shoulder with the international community when it comes to this specific arms embargo that has been put in place by the U.N.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to put these two things together.\xc2\xa0 Would a suspected arms shipment by itself constitute something that would interfere with the free flow of commerce and/or navigation in that area?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a specific arms shipment from the Iranians intended for the Houthis would be a pretty clear violation of the United Nations Security Council embargo, no doubt about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And would it also complicate the free flow of navigation and commercial shipping in there, which is the mission that they are assigned currently to maintain?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, hypothetically I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the need to protect the freedom of navigation and the need to make sure that the international community takes seriously this United Nations Security Council resolution that was just passed last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it would be hard to imagine a scenario in which if we became aware of it, we would allow an arms shipment to land in Yemen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is an embargo in place --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you would enforce it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the international community and the United Nations would certainly be serious about making sure that this embargo is upheld.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President has put the Roosevelt at the disposal of that particular mission?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The particular mission, again, for the Roosevelt is to guarantee the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re not linked?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not there to try to discourage and/or intercept an arms shipment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it is there to protect the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce.\xc2\xa0 That is the mission.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that was the principal mission.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there could be others.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but that is the reason that the Roosevelt has been sent to the Gulf of Aden.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about any sort of future events that may or may not occur, but it is possible for the United States to be justifiably concerned about protecting the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce in this volatile region on the world, while at the same time being -- ensuring that the arms embargo that the United Nations has put in place is one that everybody takes seriously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more try.\xc2\xa0 What should the Iranians conclude about the presence, this increased muscular presence of U.S. naval power as regards its activities in that region?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They should know, first and foremost, that the United States remains concerned about protecting the freedom of navigation in this region of the world.\xc2\xa0 The second is, they should also understand that the United States alongside the international community, including the United Nations, is serious about the Iranians not providing weapons to the Houthis. Again, providing weapons to the Houthis only exacerbates the violence and instability in this region in a way that will have a continued impact on the humanitarian situation in that country.</p>\n<p>The United States continues to be particularly concerned about this violence and instability in Yemen because of the way that extremist organizations have previously tried to capitalize on that turmoil to establish a safe haven and to use that safe haven to attack the United States, our interests and our allies.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty serious list of concerns.\xc2\xa0 What we also, however, believe is that there is value in pursuing a U.N.-led process to try to resolve diplomatically the legitimate concerns of all of the parties that are involved here, and that there is an opportunity for us to try to effect a legitimate political transition in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And that is our chief goal at this point because it would address all of these concerns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, engaging in an effort to effect this legitimate political transition would allow international agencies to more effectively address the urgent humanitarian situation there.\xc2\xa0 It obviously would bolster the capacity of the central government in Yemen that could prevent, or at least make it a lot harder for extremist groups to try to capitalize on the instability there to carry out attacks against the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bloomberg had a story this morning that suggests a certain amount of flexibility -- some might suggest manipulation -- on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s part of communicating what it believed and what its intelligence community actually thought about the timeline for a breakout period for Iran.\xc2\xa0 And when the President a couple of years ago said it was a year, it was in fact much closer than that.\xc2\xa0 Now the President, with the creation of the political framework, now talks about a two- or three-month breakout period.\xc2\xa0 Could you help us understand how it went from a year to two to three months, when, in fact, there are indications that when the President was saying a year it was actually closer to two or three months, and there was an attempt to sort of quiet concern about this breakout period then that is no longer present now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the Bloomberg report that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 But why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take a look at the story and see if we can help you understand the context in which the President delivered those specific remarks two or three years ago.</p>\n<p>What I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that the two- to three-month estimate is one that we have heard from outside experts and others who are drawing on an intelligence assessment to reach that conclusion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The goal of the ongoing diplomatic effort would be to extend that breakout period to a year, to essentially quadruple it or more, and put in place measures to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement so that if they did attempt a breakout, that the international community would have a year or so to determine an appropriate response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The import of my question is, oftentimes administrations are held accountable for what they convey about their own intelligence estimates, which are not always viewable to the public.\xc2\xa0 And the suggestion in the story was the President, knowing it was two or three months two years ago, said it was a year to sort of quiet and calm concerns about how close Iran in fact was, and now is being more candid because in the context of the political framework he wants to intensify concern about how close Iran is, when he was trying to minimize it a year or two ago -- when, in fact, the breakout period was precisely the same.\xc2\xa0 Do you deny on the President\xe2\x80\x99s behalf any attempt to mislead or to manipulate understanding of what Iran\xe2\x80\x99s actual capability was?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I feel confident in conveying to you without having seen the story that the President, I think throughout this process of engaging in a diplomatic effort to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, has sought to use intelligence assessments to the best of his ability to give people an accurate understanding of the threat that Iran poses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there are obviously limitations in terms of how detailed the President or anybody else can be in terms of talking about our intelligence assessments because we\xe2\x80\x99re very interested in protecting sources and methods and other things that allow us to have continued insight into these kinds of sensitive matters.\xc2\xa0 But the President all along has worked to help the United States people and our allies understand exactly what this threat is so that we can design the best mechanism for addressing that threat.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to be confident that the current diplomacy that\xe2\x80\x99s underway with Iran is by far the best way for us to succeed in preventing Iran from obtaining and nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the situation with Yemen and the Iranians, do you feel that the Iranians are trying to test you right now?\xc2\xa0 The fact that they have the United States at the negotiating table, that perhaps they\'re feeling emboldened in the sense that they could send warship; they could send ships with weapons to Yemen; that they can come up with trumped-up charges for this Washington Post reporter?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like they\'re trying to use some leverage that they have at the negotiating table to perhaps push you a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, the truth is that Iran has been engaged for quite some time in destabilizing activities throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done this in a variety of ways, and they were engaged in this kind of activity long before the United States entered into this diplomatic effort to try to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>The same is true of the unjust detention of Americans inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 These are situations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve confronted with Iran on a number of occasions throughout our history, particularly over the last 30 years or so.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to be concerned about all of those things and are candid about the fact that as important as these ongoing nuclear negotiations are to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, we do not anticipate that they will succeed in preventing Iran from engaging in a wide range of behavior that we continue to be concerned about.</p>\n<p>Iran continues to menace in an anti-Semitic way our closest ally in the region.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be very concerned about those threats, and we continue to be very concerned about that anti-Semitic language and rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terror around the globe.\xc2\xa0 Iran continues to be firmly on the state sponsor of terror list for that reason.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 The most recent example of that is their continued support for the Houthis in Yemen.</p>\n<p>We do not anticipate that the ongoing nuclear negotiations are going to succeed in resolving all of those concerns.\xc2\xa0 But what we do expect is that those talks will allow us to verifiably prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is a nuclear-armed Iran would be only more destabilizing to the Middle East, would be only more dangerous when they\'re providing support to terrorist organizations, and would be only more dangerous when they menace Israel.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why continue to see the United States focused on trying to capitalize on the best opportunity we have to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon while continuing to be candid about the wide range of concerns we have with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can the assortment of activities that you just outlined get to a point where the United States has to say, you know what, we\'re not engaging in these negotiations anymore?\xc2\xa0 Can they become such a bad actor between now and June 30th where it just goes beyond the pale and you have to say, this is not working for us?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I certainly don\'t want to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, that is a possibility.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 I also don\'t want to inadvertently give somebody an incentive here to try to -- to do something that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with.</p>\n<p>Let me just say as a general matter that the United States and the President are very focused on trying to complete these diplomatic negotiations because he does believe it is by far the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that Iran engages in a wide variety of other behaviors that are concerning to us is not a reason to break up those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it is a very strong incentive for those negotiations to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s precisely because a nuclear-armed Iran would be even more destabilizing to the region, would be even more dangerous when they menace Israel, and would be even more concerning when it comes to their support for terrorist organizations.</p>\n<p>So that is why we have made this such a priority, and why, frankly, it would be so keenly in the national security interest of the United States for these negotiations to succeed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if their behavior gets to such an egregious level, I would have to assume that that would be something in your arsenal of options that you would have to exercise at some point.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would actually --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys were ruling that out --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the behavior that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Iran when it comes to their support for terrorist organizations, their anti-Semitic rhetoric against Israel, and their destabilizing activities in the region are already egregious.\xc2\xa0 And that is why they reside on the state sponsor of terror list.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why Iran is subject to a wide range of economic sanctions that are not related to their nuclear program, but are actually related to their support for terror and their weapons programs and other things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this new embargo against -- arms embargo against the Houthis, President Saleh, his son, and others who are taking direction from them because we know that Iran is seeking to support them through the provision of weapons and in other ways.</p>\n<p>So we continue to be very concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 But that only makes the successful completion of diplomacy that would effectively prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon all that more important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Michele Leonhart, if she were to tender her resignation, the President would accept it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to speculate about any personnel moves at this point.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, coming back to another category of egregious behavior by Iran, we talked about Jason Rezaian yesterday.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\'ve seen, Amir Hekmati, another one of the Americans, who\xe2\x80\x99s been held for 1,300 days in Iran has been able to dictate out a letter over the phone in one of the conversations he was able to have with his family.\xc2\xa0 And in that letter he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cAs a war veteran who defended our nation in a time of need,\xe2\x80\x9d -- writes to congressional leaders -- \xe2\x80\x9cI ask that you also work to defend my dignity and that of my fellow Americans by putting in place serious consequences for this serial hostage-taking and mistreatment of Americans by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I understand -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been over this many times -- you\'re not going to make the release of these Americans a condition for having a final deal on the nuclear matter, but is the administration willing to impose some serious consequences on the Iranian government for taking these Americans under what appear to be specious charges?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to speculate about any possible future action, but I will say something that\'s similar to what I said before, which is that we continue to be very concerned about the unjust detention of a number of Americans inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 We have made those concerns known in quite public fashion.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also made those concerns known privately, directly with the Iranian leadership.\xc2\xa0 As recently as a month or two ago, Secretary of State John Kerry on the sidelines of his nuclear negotiations with his Iranian counterpart raised his concerns about this unjust detention.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear to the Iranians that we\'re concerned about the treatment of Americans inside of Iran, and that this continues to be a high priority for U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So expressing concern on the sidelines of negotiations is one thing.\xc2\xa0 Again, what Amir Hekmati is asking in this letter he was able to dictate from prison in Iran is that the United States impose serious consequences on Iran for taking Americans like this.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense that there should be some kind of consequences imposed by the United States on the Iranian government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is no doubt that the unjust detention of Americans in Iran has continued to serve as an impediment to better relations between the United States and Iran.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 So there already have been consequences that Iran has suffered as a result of this.</p>\n<p>But again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about any sort of future actions that we may take to further compel the Iranians to release those Americans who are being unjustly detained inside their country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His sister, who wrote a letter on behalf of the whole family, has asked for one specific thing, which doesn\'t seem to be that much of a heavy lift.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s asking that the State Department direct the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, as the protecting power, to lodge a formal protest with the Iranian government for their treatment of her brother.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the administration is willing to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the status of that specific request, but the State Department may be able to provide you some additional details about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And if I can turn to an entirely different subject quickly.\xc2\xa0 Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, you may have heard, is in New Hampshire -- been in New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 And she made a comment about the economy, and I wanted to get your reaction to this.\xc2\xa0 Regarding small business creation, she says that small business creation has \xe2\x80\x9cstalled out\xe2\x80\x9d -- she was surprised to learn this -- has stalled out in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the state of the economy regarding small businesses?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see the entirety of her remarks, but I can tell you that the President certainly believes that there is more that we can do here in Washington to put in place policies that will further strengthen job creation in our economy.\xc2\xa0 Whether that is important investments in rebuilding our infrastructure, the President believes that we can make some common-sense investments in infrastructure by merely closing some loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>By making smart investments in infrastructure, we can create jobs right away.\xc2\xa0 Many of those jobs would be created with small businesses all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And we would also see a long-term economic benefit associated with a modern, upgraded critical infrastructure in this country.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you agree with Hillary Clinton that under President Barack Obama small business creation has \xe2\x80\x9cstalled out\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\'s a direct quote.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 But I would -- the President has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cstalled out\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 She said small business creation has \xe2\x80\x9cstalled out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that it has stalled out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President himself has said many times that there are additional important steps that could be taken by Washington, D.C. where members of Congress no longer serve as an impediment to forward economic momentum, but actually that they can support it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not my question, though.\xc2\xa0 I just asked, do you agree that small business creation has stalled out in the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I didn\'t see the entirety of her remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forget what she said.\xc2\xa0 Has small business creation stalled out in the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at the statistics and get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on something that Major was asking about, the Bloomberg article.\xc2\xa0 I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read it, but I think this is a pretty straightforward question.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be a disconnect between the timeline -- is what the article is saying -- meaning for the longest time the President was saying Iran is about a year away currently from having the materials to create a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And then that changed as we got closer to April, you could say even late 2014.\xc2\xa0 So my question is:\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the President didn\'t know that the assessment from his intelligence community that Iran was two or three months away as far back as 2012 or \xe2\x80\x9913?\xc2\xa0 Was he unaware of that assessment?\xc2\xa0 Was he not properly briefed on that assessment?\xc2\xa0 Or was the information that has now been declassified something that he never took a look at?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, what I can tell you is that the President time and time again has made clear how important it is for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of making that case, the President has made clear that we need to be concerned about the previous actions that Iran has taken to try to circumvent international monitoring of their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President is working hard to try to reach a diplomatic solution that would effectively shut down every pathway that Iran has to a nuclear weapon, would roll back certain key aspects of their nuclear program, and impose on Iran the most stringent set of sanctions that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s great.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve read that.\xc2\xa0 We know that you believe that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not doubting the veracity of that goal.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is, how is that his own administration was saying they\'re about two to three months away for the longest period of time, and yet the President himself was saying they\'re about a year away?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out, did he not read their assessments?\xc2\xa0 Did he disagree?\xc2\xa0 Was there disagreement within the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Kevin, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen story that you\'re referencing.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at it, and we can get back to you with some more details.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask one more thing, if I could.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday we had the opportunity to talk at length about some of the Americans that had been unfairly imprisoned in Iran.\xc2\xa0 Is it your position that the White House is doing all it can, short of making it a condition for further negotiations, to win the release of these individuals?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is fair for you to report that the White House has made very clear to the Iranians that the release of these Americans who are being unjustly detained in Iran is necessary and should be done immediately.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The White House and senior administration officials have been in touch with the families of those Americans who have been unjustly detained.\xc2\xa0 We have made these views known directly to the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 And it is an important item on the long list of concerns that we have about Iran and their behavior that includes their menacing of Israel, their ongoing support for terror organizations around the globe, and their continued destabilizing activity throughout the already volatile region in which they live.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can go back to the waters off Yemen, does the U.S. believe that there are arms on the Iranian ships there?\xc2\xa0 And if so, in an area where Iranian ships generally are not, would the U.S. consider that a provocation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I don\'t want to speculate about, again, any sort of future developments.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that we have raised concerns for a while now about Iran supporting the Houthis in a variety of ways, including providing them weapons.\xc2\xa0 The international community is so concerned about this that the United Nations at the Security Council passed a resolution that imposed an embargo against the Houthis, against President Saleh, against his son, and others who are taking direction from them.\xc2\xa0 And this is an embargo that we expect every country around the world, including Iran, to abide by.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that we take seriously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President also -- as I mentioned in response to Major\xe2\x80\x99s question and to several others -- continues to be concerned about the instability in *Iran Yemen interfering with the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce in the Gulf of Aden.\xc2\xa0 And there are U.S. military resources in the Gulf of Aden to try to protect those two priorities, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I take from that [that] the U.S. is unsure if there are weapons on Iranian ships there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate or -- I don\'t have an intelligence assessment to share at this point. But the United States is concerned because Iran has been supporting the Houthis and has provided them weapons.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear both publicly and privately our concern with that behavior.</p>\n<p>We are concerned principally because that will only further the violence in a country that has already been ripped apart by war.\xc2\xa0 It has resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe that only seems to get worse by the day.\xc2\xa0 We\'re also concerned because there is a track record inside Yemen where extremist groups have tried to capitalize on the political turmoil there to establish a safe haven and use that safe haven to plot attacks against the United States and our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are any number of concerns that we have about the situation in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the best way, in our view, to address all of this is for the U.N.-led process to get the support of everybody in the region and around the world to encourage all the sides in this dispute to sit down at the negotiating table and engage in a legitimate political transition that would restore some stability to the country, that would allow international aid groups to try to meet some of the acute humanitarian needs in that country.</p>\n<p>It also would try to bring some political stability to the country that would make it harder for extremist groups to operate there.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long list of concerns, and this is a political situation that is being very closely watched by the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team and even the President himself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just really quickly on one domestic story.\xc2\xa0 Now that the anti-trafficking bill, there\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement and may well go through -- I think the latest whip count I saw had five Republican votes for Loretta Lynch.\xc2\xa0 Understanding that you\'ve said many times from the podium you would have liked to have seen her confirmed many months ago, and that she deserves to be confirmed, how confident are you at this point that she will be confirmed?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about the closeness of the vote?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\'re concerned about right now is the extensive delay to which she\xe2\x80\x99s been unfairly subjected.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re up to 164 days now.\xc2\xa0 And she is somebody who earned bipartisan support in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\xc2\xa0 She certainly deserves strong bipartisan support on the floor of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who has a well-deserved reputation for being a tough, fair prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 Her track record speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 The fact that she has the support of both civil rights organizations, law enforcement organizations, and even former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani I think is an indication that she is somebody who is very well qualified for this job.</p>\n<p>Pamela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is a nuclear deal with Iran, and the sanctions begin to be eased gradually or quickly, what leverage is there left to try and get these Americans out of Iran and deal with some of the other concerns that you have with Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there would be several things.\xc2\xa0 The first is there would continue to be a long list of other sanctions that would be in place against Iran.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that even if we\'re able to reach a nuclear agreement, and we\'re able to engage in a process where Iran takes tangible, verifiable steps to comply with the agreement by curtailing and even rolling back some aspects of their nuclear program, that they would get some phased-in sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>But that would not include relief from sanctions that are related to their weapons programs.\xc2\xa0 That would not relate to sanctions that relate to human rights or their support for terrorism.\xc2\xa0 So we would continue to have significant concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, and there would continue to be significant pressure on Iran to change that behavior.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be U.S. sanctions, as opposed to international sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it would be both.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are other countries that have significant concerns about these other aspects of Iranian behavior, and they have imposed some financial penalties against Iran for that behavior too.</p>\n<p>Again, those kinds of sanctions are not on the table in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Even if we\'re able to successfully complete these negotiations and Iran begins to implement their end of the nuclear bargain in a way that would shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon and allow the international community to verify that -- sanctions that are related to their weapons programs, that are related to human rights violations, that are related to their support for terrorism would continue to be in place.</p>\n<p>Susan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On trade, as you know, Senator Ron Wyden has a lot of -- he has a mixed record on trade.\xc2\xa0 But he also -- Oregon also has a lot of business in Asia that would benefit from it, like Nike and Intel.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if from Sandy Levin\xe2\x80\x99s comments today, if you rely too heavily -- or last week -- if you rely too heavily on Ron Wyden to negotiate the deal?\xc2\xa0 And if you feel like your White House leg affairs shop did a good job reaching out to Capitol Hill and Democrats?\xc2\xa0 And if you\'re worried about their support on the House side?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Susan, I can tell you that the administration at all levels -- frankly, not just the leg affairs team -- has been engaged in an effort to convey to members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that putting in place the most progressive, far-reaching trade promotion authority bill in history is a priority for him.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority that this bill includes enforceable labor provisions and enforceable environmental provisions, and provisions related to human rights.</p>\n<p>What that means is it means that there is ample reason for Democrats and Republicans to support this particular bill that would essentially allow the President to go out and negotiate an agreement and set up a mechanism for congressional consideration and hopefully eventual approval.</p>\n<p>But the President has been very clear about what he expects this essential -- this final agreement to look like and what, frankly, the agreement will require before he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Levin says that the human rights language is too vague and doesn\'t have any teeth.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my response to that is that this is the most far-reaching progressive trade promotion authority bill that Congress has ever passed.\xc2\xa0 And I describe it that way because it has enforceable labor provisions.\xc2\xa0 It includes enforceable environmental provisions, and it includes provisions related to human rights.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no expert on the legislative history of trade promotion agreements, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is common for trade promotion bills to even include references to human rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think this is an indication that the President is engaged in a process that he\xe2\x80\x99s confident, if successful, will be something that will benefit middle-class families, American workers and American businesses.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, the President I think was pretty blunt about his concern that failure to engage in these kinds of negotiations would essentially cede ground to -- at least when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- to the Chinese.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we would be in a situation where there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the Chinese government would seek to engage in this region of the world, and write rules and set standards that are much lower than the kinds of standards that the United States is advocating for.\xc2\xa0 And that would have the effect of putting American workers and American businesses at a significant disadvantage when they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do business in one of the most economically dynamic regions of the globe.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President I think made a pretty forceful case that failing to support this kind of trade agreement would essentially be ratifying the status quo in which American businesses would be -- and open up the potential where the next 20 or 30 years it would be actually much tougher for American businesses to do business in Asia, and if they do, that they\xe2\x80\x99d be doing so on terms that are not advantageous to American workers.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is a leading advocate of engaging in this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the final thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say on this is that what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a final agreement yet, and that there will be ample opportunity for the Congress and for the public to evaluate the terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach one.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, Ambassador Froman has been tirelessly engaged in the effort to try to negotiate this agreement.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate this will be the topic of some conversation when Prime Minister Abe visits the White House one week from today.</p>\n<p>But the President believes that this is a priority not just as it relates to the immediate impact it would have on our economy, but based on the longer-term impact it would have on our economy and the long-term prospects for American workers and American businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more quick one.\xc2\xa0 Was there any consideration before you sent this aircraft carrier out to the Gulf of Aden to send a War Powers Act request up to Congress?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so.\xc2\xa0 But if -- let me check with the lawyers on that before I completely rule that out.\xc2\xa0 My suspicion is that based on the fact that there is already a military presence there, that a War Powers Act notification would be unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 But let me check on that.*\xc2\xa0 Usually the explanations for these kinds of things are more complicated than they seen, so I may not have done justice to the full legal explanation.\xc2\xa0 So let me follow up with you on that, okay?\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t* The War Powers Resolution states that a report shall be submitted to Congress within 48 hours of certain criteria being met.\xc2\xa0 These criteria were not present here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Toluse.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to take you a little bit back to what you just said about Trade Representative Michael Froman.\xc2\xa0 He recently came back from Tokyo.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what kind of progress you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make there?\xc2\xa0 Was that trip a success?\xc2\xa0 And were you expecting or hoping for more progress as we get ready for the trip of the Prime Minister next week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Toluse, I can tell you that Ambassador Froman has described his trip as successful in substantially narrowing the differences between the United States and Japan when it comes to negotiating this Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 He also was pretty blunt about the fact that continued work is needed to ultimately resolve the outstanding issues that remain between the two countries.</p>\n<p>I know that both Ambassador Froman and his counterpart have directed their teams to continue to try to narrow those gaps based on the guidance that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been given.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to believe that continued success in narrowing those gaps is important to the momentum behind the broader TPP conversations.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that this will continue to be a topic of conversation around the White House in the days leading up to Prime Minister Abe\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the two leaders will have the opportunity to spend some time on it, as well.</p>\n<p>Again, what the President is seeking is a trade agreement that is clearly in the best interest of American businesses and American workers.\xc2\xa0 And raising standards as it relates to labor and the environment is good for -- is certainly good for leveling the playing field.\xc2\xa0 And the President is confident that if we can level the playing field in terms of doing business in that region of the world, that American businesses are very well-positioned to compete for and win business in some of those emerging markets.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about specifically what he said, that there were issues that had been narrowed?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about specifically about which issues were narrowed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more detailed accounting of Ambassador Froman\xe2\x80\x99s conversations, but you can contact his office.\xc2\xa0 They may be able to provide you more a more detailed readout.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on trade -- the President has been talking a lot about trade.\xc2\xa0 Recently, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing an interview -- or I guess recently did an interview over in Virginia.\xc2\xa0 How important is it to convince Democrats to get onboard with this?\xc2\xa0 And how many Democratic senators do you think you have on your side on this so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Toluse, I can tell you that the President is going to make a pretty strong case to both Democrats and Republicans on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I know that there is a -- the President acknowledged this when he was asked about it by your colleague at Bloomberg last week -- that there is a reflexive opposition in many quarters of the Democratic Party to the idea, the concept of international trade.</p>\n<p>The President continues to be confident that he will be in a position to make a very persuasive case to both Democrats and Republicans that the kind of agreement he signs is one that is clearly in the best interest of American workers and clearly in the best interest of American businesses.</p>\n<p>The kinds of economic interests are not the kinds of things that have traditionally been -- that have traditionally broken down along party lines.\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about opening up overseas markets for American businesses, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that Democrats and Republicans traditionally are able to get behind.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly will be appealing to both Democrats and Republicans on those grounds if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach a broader agreement.</p>\n<p>But the other thing that I think is a pretty persuasive case -- and again, has nothing to do with ideology or partisan affiliation but I think has to do with fact -- and that is that if the United States were to disengage from Asia when it comes to trying to open up access to overseas markets for American businesses, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a negative long-term impact on the U.S. economy and on individual U.S. businesses and U.S. workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the threat that is associated with disengagement is a significant one, and again, I think one that either a conservative Democrat -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, either a conservative Republican or a progressive Democrat could understand and be concerned about, frankly.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is engaged in this effort to open up these markets and to level the playing field.</p>\n<p>The President continues to be confident that if we can level the playing field and if we can essentially raise standards in this region of the world that has the most dynamic and populous economies, that there will be a genuine economic opportunity for American businesses.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to win -- convince every single member of Congress, but it should be a persuasive argument to both Democrats and Republicans, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making the case to both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Toluse, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one quick question about the trip to the Everglades tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The President said in his weekly address that that climate change is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be longer-lasting and bigger than his presidency.\xc2\xa0 Is he expecting as he goes down to the backyard of top 2016 candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush to address their stance on climate change?\xc2\xa0 And is he hoping that his trip will get them to speak about it more?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would not anticipate that the President will be singling out any presidential candidates while he\xe2\x80\x99s there, but I would anticipate that the President is hopeful that this will continue to add some momentum and energy to the ongoing political debate about climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there are significant national security consequences for climate change -- the Pentagon will tell you that.\xc2\xa0 There are significant economic consequences for failing to deal with the consequences of climate change -- there are lots of business leaders who will tell you that.\xc2\xa0 There are significant consequences for public health when it comes to air pollution and air quality and other factors that contribute to climate change -- our leading medical experts make that clear to us.\xc2\xa0 There are significant impact on public safety when it comes to failing to deal with climate change -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got law enforcement officials and local and state level elected official who would tell you that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are any number of reasons for the U.S. to continue and build on the leadership role that this President has established for the United States when it comes to dealing with climate change and reducing the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s carbon pollution and using our influence to get other countries, like we have successfully with China, to get them to make commitments to reduce their carbon pollution, as well.\xc2\xa0 And the President is proud of the leadership role that he\xe2\x80\x99s played in this effort, but he certainly welcomes the engagement in this broader debate by Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>Again, when it comes to basic national security and public health questions, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be about Democrats and Republicans, it should be about us united as Americans to confront this threat.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to two subjects really fast -- Loretta Lynch and human trafficking.\xc2\xa0 Since Dems and Republicans seem to be working on the logjam in the Senate, what is the timetable that the White House has been given for a Senate vote for Loretta Lynch?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a latest update in terms of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the fact that she has been waiting 164 days is, that vote, whenever it occurs, is long overdue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no timetable, like maybe the end of this week, beginning of next week?\xc2\xa0 Are you setting like a deadline -- what is this, end of April -- maybe like the first, second week of May?\xc2\xa0 Are you setting a deadline or something?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not setting a deadline.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that if there\xe2\x80\x99s any sort of deadline that was set, it\xe2\x80\x99s been far surpassed.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Republicans to stop playing politics with the nomination of an obviously qualified woman to be the next Attorney General of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And an easier question I guess.\xc2\xa0 The President ever year has -- he delivers addresses for commencements.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a list of commencement speeches that he will be giving?\xc2\xa0 And will he be doing an HBCU again this year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the only commencement address that\xe2\x80\x99s been announced so far is the President is planning next month to go to South Dakota and deliver the commencement address at Watertown community college.\xc2\xa0 Is that the name of it?\xc2\xa0 Okay -- the Watertown community college *Lake Area Technical Institute.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to that opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he planning on having anything added to his schedule?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys looking at others still, or is that just one --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that the President also traditionally speaks at a commencement ceremony for the military -- one of the military service academies; I believe the Coast Guard is next up on the rotation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I made news there or not, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you did.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there you go.\xc2\xa0 So everyone enjoy all of that.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got that to look forward to.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any additional commencements that are on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99d just be doing two this year and that\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any others beyond those two.\xc2\xa0 I know that the First Lady today has put out the list of commencement addresses that she\xe2\x80\x99s planning.\xc2\xa0 One of them is a high school in Chicago, Oberlin College in Ohio, and an HBCU in Alabama -- Tuskegee College I believe, as well.</p>\n<p>Luis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Prime Minister Abe\xe2\x80\x99s visit next week, it looks like the U.S. is preparing quite a welcome for him; he\xe2\x80\x99s going to address Congress for the first time in more than a half century -- Japanese Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message the U.S. wants to send to the region, especially China?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pomp and circumstance associated with a state visit.\xc2\xa0 And we are looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Abe not just to the United States but also to the White House.\xc2\xa0 And it will be an opportunity for the President and Prime Minister Abe to continue to build on the strong working relationship that the two have personally established, but also to strengthen the ties between our two countries.</p>\n<p>Those ties aren\xe2\x80\x99t just political, they are also economic, they are related to security, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also strong ties between our people.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of Japanese Americans who have contributed significantly to the strength and dynamism of our country, and we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly pleased about that.</p>\n<p>There are obviously important values that we share -- respect for human rights, commitment to democracy.\xc2\xa0 These are all things that are critical to the strength of the relationship between the United States and Japan.\xc2\xa0 One high-profile topic on the agenda will be the status of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, and the hope that by raising standards and leveling the playing field, we can secure an agreement that is clearly in the best interest of the United States and American businesses and American workers, but also in a way that fairly is beneficial to the Japanese economy, as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And certainly, Prime Minister Abe will be in a position to advocate aggressively for his country and his country\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that based on his track record of doing that over the last couple of years, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that both when he\xe2\x80\x99s here at the White House and as we try to complete these TPP negotiations in the future.</p>\n<p>John, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great, I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, just following up on a number of answers that you gave regarding the movement of the Roosevelt to the Red Sea in that particular area of the world, is the U.S. prepared to enforce militarily the U.N. Security Council resolution regarding the arms embargo in Yemen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, John, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about any sort of possible future activities.\xc2\xa0 What I will just say -- and maybe what I will just repeat -- is that the chief responsibility of the Roosevelt and other U.S. naval assets in that region is to ensure the freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>And there are significant economic consequences for the disruption of navigation and commerce there.\xc2\xa0 And given all of the instability that we see around Yemen and that region of the world, we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t need that to be worsened in the waterways there.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re cognizant of that.\xc2\xa0 That is the chief responsibility of the U.S. military personnel that are serving our country aboard naval vessels in the Gulf of Aden right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of passing that U.N. Security Council resolution if you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to actually enforce it militarily?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United Nations Security Council did come together and speak loudly with one voice in terms of imposing an arms embargo against the Houthis, against former President Saleh, against his son, and against others who are acting at the direction of those individuals.</p>\n<p>The international community is resolute in ensuring that that arms embargo is enforced.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s true I think, as I acknowledged earlier, that if Iran or anyone else were to try to provide arms to the Houthis, it would be in direct violation of that United Nations Security Council resolution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what would be the consequences of that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I -- and maybe I missed something -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I heard anything during the course of this briefing that should give the Iranian government pause in terms of the possibility of them delivering arms to the Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated here publicly and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the Iranians are well aware of the serious concerns that the United States has about their continued support for the Houthis.\xc2\xa0 And their continued supply of support and weapons and equipment to the Houthis would raise significant concerns and be in direct violation of the embargo that was passed by the United Nations Security Council.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:53 P.M.
