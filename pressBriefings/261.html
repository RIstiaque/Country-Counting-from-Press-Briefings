Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:05 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements to make at the top, Jim, so we can go straight to questions, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to start.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about trade.\xc2\xa0 You said that it\xe2\x80\x99s an ugly process but it can yield a good result.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you still think that today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hope springs eternal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This Medicare offset in the trade adjustment assistance component of the bill seems to be a major sticking point that Boehner and Ryan have attempted to fix, that Leader Pelosi today said that had been fixed.\xc2\xa0 However, that still seems to be a sticking point.\xc2\xa0 Secretary of Labor Tom Perez sent a letter today supporting that TAA package.\xc2\xa0 Does the President that Democrats simply don\xe2\x80\x99t want to vote for, even temporarily, for something that would cut Medicare?\xc2\xa0 Or does he think they want to use this to keep that fast track for a period?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those congressional Democrats to determine their motive.\xc2\xa0 But there are two things that I think are worth clarifying.\xc2\xa0 And the first is, as a strictly legislative procedural matter, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the vote is structured in such a way that anyone who supports -- who essentially votes for the trade adjustment assistance package on the floor of the House, when it comes up for a vote tomorrow, will not have to vote for that Medicare offset.\xc2\xa0 Based on the way that they\xe2\x80\x99ve structured it, there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- you guys know more about this than I do -- but there is a rule that has been put in place that, if passed, would prevent any member of Congress -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats who are most concerned about this -- from having to vote for the Medicare offset.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is what led Leader Pelosi to conclude that this particular concern that she has raised had been effectively addressed.\xc2\xa0 And this goes to something that I described yesterday, which is this is the kind of bipartisan effort that typically does yield success in the House.\xc2\xa0 And this is an effort from Democrats and Republicans to sit down at the table, try to identify common ground, address mutual concerns, and try to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why, as I mentioned earlier, hope does continue to spring eternal.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s a second piece to this that\xe2\x80\x99s also really important for people to understand, and this has gotten lost in the debate a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Trade adjustment assistance -- the trade adjustment assistance program that currently exists is scheduled to expire at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the Speaker of the House, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said so already, would be happy to tell you that if trade adjustment assistance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass this week, it\xe2\x80\x99s very unlikely to pass before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is it means that if you\xe2\x80\x99re a member of Congress and you vote against trade adjustment assistance this week, you are adding your name to the death certificate of trade adjustment assistance -- because it will go away.\xc2\xa0 And that is a source of significant concern to the President and, I know, many other Democrats on Capitol Hill, because we know how critically important trade adjustment assistance is to middle-class families all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a program that, over its life, has served 2.2 million American workers.\xc2\xa0 And the good news, Jim, is that this is not just an extension of the already existing program; it represents a significant expansion.\xc2\xa0 It nearly doubles the cap of money that\xe2\x80\x99s allowed to be spent on these programs.\xc2\xa0 It makes a large number of American workers eligible once again for trade adjustment assistance, including more than 17,000 workers who\xe2\x80\x99d previously had their application denied over the last 18 months.\xc2\xa0 They can now have their application reconsidered for eligibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a lot of reasons for Democrats and Republicans to support trade adjustment assistance when it\xe2\x80\x99s on the floor at the end of the week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, even as Leader Pelosi said that she thought that the Medicare issue had been fixed, she still also raised the concern regarding public employees not being included in the TAA.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, are Democrats moving the goal post here?\xc2\xa0 Is that a potential problem for you guys?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have indicated is that the last TAA bill that I referred to earlier -- the one that passed in 2011 -- was supported unanimously by Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And it didn\xe2\x80\x99t include eligibility, specific eligibility for public sector workers.\xc2\xa0 And there were no significant concerns that were raised at that time.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact is, this piece of legislation is consistent with that, and it would significantly expand those workers who are eligible.\xc2\xa0 It would expand eligibility to those workers that may have been affected by trade with non-FTA countries, like India or China.\xc2\xa0 And again, according to the statistics from the Department of Labor, that would affect up to 30,000 American workers.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that when public sector workers were eligible between 2009 and 2011, do you know how many public sector workers actually were certified as eligible to apply for trade adjustment assistance benefits?\xc2\xa0 Zero.\xc2\xa0 None.\xc2\xa0 Not a single one.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that is why -- again, when you consider the opportunity that exists for the United States Congress to pass legislation that would make up to 30,000 workers, who were affected by trade with non-FTA countries, eligible for trade adjustment assistance, and another 17,000 workers who have previously been denied over the last 18 months, and would have the opportunity to have their application reconsidered.\xc2\xa0 The expansion of this trade adjustment assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s included in this bill far outweighs any concerns about the inclusion of public sector workers, principally because when public sector workers were included in the legislation, none of them were deemed eligible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this issue that Ms. Pelosi is raising is a false argument?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is we have a very strong case to make about why Democrats and Republicans should be able to act in bipartisan fashion to make sure that trade adjustment assistance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expire.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, they can actually be a part of making sure that these important benefits are expanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about what the President has been doing today?\xc2\xa0 His conversation with the Speaker and the advocacy that Denis McDonough, Tom Perez and Secretary Lew are making on the Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve about covered it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The fact is, everybody from the President on down, including many members of his team here at the White House and his economic team across the administration, are making an aggressive case to members of Congress about why they should support this trade package that is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives over the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President did have an opportunity to call Speaker Boehner today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have details of that conversation to share with you.\xc2\xa0 They talked about this particular issue.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think it is indicative of the kind of bipartisan cooperation that we know is ultimately successful to passing meaningful legislation in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 And this is the kind of template that we have long sought and we have long encouraged Republicans who are in the majority to engage in.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re pleased to do our part.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, it doesn\'t mean that a perfect piece of legislation is going to pass.\xc2\xa0 But it does mean that Democrats and Republicans should be able to seize common ground to advance values that they share.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, we\'re talking about trying to expand economic opportunity for everybody American.\xc2\xa0 And that should be an area where Democrats and Republicans can find common ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the past, we often haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to, but here\xe2\x80\x99s a prime opportunity for us to do it entirely consistent with the kinds of progressive values that the President has championed throughout his time here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, does the White House support Senator Burr\xe2\x80\x99s cyber information-sharing bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the details of the particular bill.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward his own legislative language at the beginning of this year that we believe would make it easier for the federal government to effectively respond to intrusions when they occur.\xc2\xa0 It also will allow both government and private sector websites -- or private sector servers to better protect their networks from cyber intrusions.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have pretty aggressively advocated congressional passage of that legislative language.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be controversial.\xc2\xa0 It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t partisan in nature.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s technical enough that it would make sure that federal authorities have what they need to try to protect not just government computer networks but also taking steps that would help the private sector protect their networks from cyber intrusions, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Senator Burr and some other Republicans are trying to move some cyber information-sharing legislation.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been a suggestion that it be attached to the\xc2\xa0NDAA.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House make of that approach?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we take a pretty dim view of that approach, to be blunt about it.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we want the Senate to pass\xc2\xa0cybersecurity\xc2\xa0legislation, not play games with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the suggestion that they\'re going to attach it to a piece of legislation that the President has already indicated he opposed is an indication that they\'re interested -- more interested in playing politics than they are in actually making sure that we have all the tools we need to protect the American people from cyber hacks, either emanating inside the United States or, more commonly, abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the White House -- correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong -- but the White House seems to regularly issue veto threats for the\xc2\xa0NDAA.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes down to it, the President signs these large defense spending bills, authorization bills.\xc2\xa0 So how serious is the White House this time around about this veto threat for the\xc2\xa0NDAA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Very serious.\xc2\xa0 And I would -- we\'re obviously talking about some weighty policy matters when we\'re talking about the National Defense Authorization Act.\xc2\xa0 And the President has in the past expressed serious concerns with some of the things that members of Congress have sought to add to this legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the concerns that the President has are serious.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen so far in the House that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives to sustain a presidential veto.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s an indication that the President\xe2\x80\x99s veto threat should be taken quite seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the Hill today, Lieutenant Colonel Jason\xc2\xa0Amerine\xc2\xa0testified that chaos and friction within the Obama administration between the FBI and the DOD led to a failure to gain the release of at least five civilian hostages, including Warren Weinstein and an American, Caitlin Coleman, and the child she gave birth to in captivity of the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 His direct quote was, \xe2\x80\x9cOur nation lacks an organization that can synchronize the efforts of all our government agencies to get our hostages home.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, what I would say, first of all, is that the President has talked extensively about the great lengths that the U.S. government has gone to try to secure the safe return of American hostages being held overseas.\xc2\xa0 The President has on a number of occasions ordered special operators to go into dangerous places, including into Syria, to try to secure the release of U.S. hostages.\xc2\xa0 The President has also ordered similar raids in Yemen.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that is an indication that the President is willing to take some big risks.\xc2\xa0 And our men and women in uniform are willing to put themselves in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way to try to secure the safe return of American hostages.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a pretty clear demonstration of this President and this administration\xe2\x80\x99s and this country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to securing the release of American hostages.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what I will also say is that I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about individual cases from up here, either of previous -- I\'m not going to talk about any individual cases.\xc2\xa0 But what the President has acknowledged, and what his team is diligently working on, is a review of the process that the administration carries out for handling these cases and communicating with the families of those who are being held hostage.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are a number of proposals that have been circulated.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that we would have some more details soon as it relates to some policy changes that we believe would make our government even more effective in leveraging all of our assets to try to secure the return of American hostages.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it does sound as though you\xe2\x80\x99re not disagreeing that there are some problems about communication between the FBI, the DOD, when these things happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what we have acknowledged is that there are some reforms that we could put in place that would better integrate the elements of the federal government that are working so hard to secure the release of American hostages.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, if I could.\xc2\xa0 ABC News has been reporting that the administration, according to one person -- a U.S. official -- are familiar with the OPM hack.\xc2\xa0 Says the hack itself is far deeper and far more problematic than administration officials have been admitting.\xc2\xa0 That there is, in fact, an effort by the White House to tell other agencies not to release full information to reporters about the extent of this hack.\xc2\xa0 Is this hack more deep and more wide than what the administration has told us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, what I can tell you is that the precise scope of this particular intrusion is one that continues to be under investigation by the FBI and other technical experts that have the knowledge necessary to try to figure out what exactly has occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think we have been clear since this news broke that this is a matter that we take very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And we do -- we are concerned that this could -- again, based on an early review of what\xe2\x80\x99s transpired, could potentially have affected more than 4 million federal employees.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also been blunt about the fact that we know that the Office of Personnel Management maintains sensitive data and sensitive information about federal employees.\xc2\xa0 Again, the precise scope of how much and what type of data has been\xc2\xa0exfiltrated\xc2\xa0is something that, again, continues to be investigated by the FBI and other technical experts.\xc2\xa0 But we have already begun the process of contacting those that we thus far believe could potentially have been affected in a serious way.\xc2\xa0 And if additional notifications are necessary, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we will -- that responsibility is one that we take seriously.\xc2\xa0 As additional notifications are necessary, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do we have the whole story now about what the White House does know?\xc2\xa0 Or are you holding back information about the extent of this hack?\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99re being told that it\xe2\x80\x99s much more than 4 million people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, the thing that we have been clear about is that there are certain elements of the investigation that we are reluctant to talk about publicly because the disclosure of some pieces of information could inhibit the ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been true -- that\xe2\x80\x99s limited our ability to talk about other cyber intrusions when they\xe2\x80\x99ve occurred.\xc2\xa0 So this is a hallmark of these kinds of investigations.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrankly, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a hallmark of a lot of criminal investigations that even don\xe2\x80\x99t involve crimes committed in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 But what is also true is there\xe2\x80\x99s also a reluctance to talk in a lot of detail while the investigation is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say something that would be contradicted by our investigators once they\xe2\x80\x99ve obtained additional information.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think we certainly are being cautious in terms of what information we are communicating, but we have also been pretty direct about living up to our commitment to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re communicating directly with those that need to be notified about a potential breach of their sensitive data.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is walking a fine line; I would acknowledge that as well.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to share additional information about this ongoing investigation in the future, then we will try to do that given the limitations that I\xe2\x80\x99ve just described.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 We learned today that General Dempsey told reporters that the administration is open to opening up more bases in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking -- is that consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking?\xc2\xa0 And are there any immediate or specific plans to do that beyond what we learned yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are no immediate or specific plans to do that.\xc2\xa0 As my colleagues in the Pentagon will tell you, that they devote significant time and energy and resources to contingency planning.\xc2\xa0 And the President relies on his military advisors in particular to spend a lot of time thinking ahead about what could lie ahead in the future.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned earlier, there is no immediate plan to do this.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will say, though, is that if a kind of recommendation like this did come from the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team and from his military advisors in particular, it would be a recommendation that is made -- it would be a recommendation that reflects that the ongoing training efforts have been useful.\xc2\xa0 That the reason that we would consider expanding the training operation, and the advise-and-assist operation that\xe2\x80\x99s underway, would be because it\xe2\x80\x99s been an effective element of our strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean, however, that it would require the additional deployment of American military personnel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it could include the deployment of American military personnel.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but it might not.\xc2\xa0 So again, this is all very hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 But it might not.\xc2\xa0 This is all very hypothetical because this is not a recommendation that the President\xe2\x80\x99s military advisors have offered.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point speaks to a concern -- and we talked about this yesterday among two of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic colleagues -- that we are seeing increasingly more troops, more U.S. forces going to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Representative Charlie Rangel said -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting him -- \xe2\x80\x9cThis is exactly how Vietnam started.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Your response to that broader concern that this is, in fact, mission creep?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, as I think I tried to point out, if a decision were made to open an additional facility to offer training and advice and assistance to fighters fighting under the command and control of the Iraqi central government, that would be a very clear indication that previous efforts -- or currently ongoing efforts to do that -- have been useful.\xc2\xa0 And it would -- rather than being evidence of mission creep, it would be evidence of some progress in the ongoing mission to support the Iraqis as they take the fight to\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0on the ground in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat also is undeniable are the numbers.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when the President took office in 2009, there were about 150,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 The current situation is that there are about 3,500 U.S. military personnel in Iraq not in a combat role -- in a variety of roles that includes military advisors, force protection, intelligence officers, those who are staffing joint operations centers, and others.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that, to some extent, semantics to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re not in a combat role?\xc2\xa0 I mean, again --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Charlie Rangel says, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re putting them in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, you\xe2\x80\x99re not living in the real world.\xc2\xa0 And they are going into a very dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is very clear what the President has asked them to do and what their commanders have asked them to do.\xc2\xa0 And the President does not, and has not, put currently deployed military personnel in Iraq to go and directly engage the\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0enemy.\xc2\xa0 They are there to support the Iraqi people to do for them what they must do for themselves -- or to support them in what they must do for themselves.\xc2\xa0 And that is to support Iraqis, who are under the command and control of the Iraqi central government, as they take the fight on the ground to\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States and our coalition partners have deployed military personnel to support them in that effort.\xc2\xa0 And that means, in some cases, doing training; in some cases offering advice and assistance; in some cases providing military equipment; in some cases staffing a joint operations center.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, this will be the responsibility of the Iraqi people, and it\'s something that they must do for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to close the loop, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Is there any timeline by which the President will sit down and decide whether or not to open up another base?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Kristen, the President will be relying on the advice of his national security team, including senior members of the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 And this is not something that they have recommended, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that even General Dempsey said.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s important to understand the context in which General Dempsey made those comments and to understand the role that he has, which is to spend a lot of time thinking ahead and doing contingency planning.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s pretty clear from the comments that he shared today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one on the trade deal, Josh.\xc2\xa0 There is some concern among lawmakers that the trade deal could impact, could in some ways threaten food safety.\xc2\xa0 Is the President confident that that won\'t happen?\xc2\xa0 Can he assure Americans that that won\'t happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 He can assure Americans that that will not happen.\xc2\xa0 Principally -- there are a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 I know that The Washington Post has taken a look at this and has been pretty harshly critical of the arguments that have been made by some who\xe2\x80\x99ve raised this concern because it just didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to any scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is the reason that we engage in these kinds of trade agreements is because we want to raise standards.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what this trade agreement would do, even when it comes to food safety.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 My favorite subject -- today on Capitol Hill, Speaker Boehner was asked about the spending bills and the possibility of budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And he again said he was open to that, but said the White House needs to go first, needs to initiate those.\xc2\xa0 Would you be open to doing that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, as you know, in the wisdom of our forefathers, it meant that they wrote the Constitution of the United States to give the power of the purse to the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 It means that Congress, individuals who decide to run for Congress are signing up for the responsibility of doing what I would acknowledge is difficult work, which is making very difficult, critically important decisions about our priorities, and about how the resources of the American people are properly used to advance the interest of our country and all of our citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have been clear about is that Congress identified a pretty effective process for resolving differences and trying to come to agreement on some of these difficult issues when Senator Patty Murray and Congressman Paul Ryan sat down at the negotiating table and hammered out an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And they did that to build a bipartisan agreement that both Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress could support.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the White House was, of course, involved in that process.\xc2\xa0 We were aware of what was going on.\xc2\xa0 We, in some cases, offered some technical assistance about helping them understand what impact certain budgetary decisions would have.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, this is something that Congress must resolve.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will also say, though, is that the President put forward a budget.\xc2\xa0 The President has actually been very clear about what direction he thinks that we should go.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a common-sense, fiscally responsible plan that puts the interests of middle-class families first, and makes expanding economic opportunity for every American the top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear template for how this can get resolved.\xc2\xa0 We have been clear, and we\'ve demonstrated a willingness to play a supportive role in those conversations.\xc2\xa0 And the President has actually put forward already, months ago, a specific template for the direction that he believes those conversations should go.\xc2\xa0 Now it\'s time for Congress to step up and do their job.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully they will.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple for you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You said that everybody from the President on down is making calls on trade.\xc2\xa0 Does that include the Vice President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would check with the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s making calls today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in your back and forth with Kristen, you suggested that this hypothetical future opening of other facilities in Iraq would be a sign of progress.\xc2\xa0 Did I hear that correctly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make, Olivier, I think what I described is -- I described it as useful.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is simply this:\xc2\xa0 that if -- if, again, hypothetically -- the President were to make a decision at the recommendation of his national security team to open up an additional facility in Iraq where training, advising and assisting could occur, he would only do that if already open facilities where training, advising and assisting of Iraqi fighters is occurring was useful.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the point is, it was an effort -- I was anticipating Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question -- this question about mission creep, which I think is a legitimate one to raise.\xc2\xa0 I think the point is that if an additional base were opened at the recommendation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team, it would be entirely consistent and, frankly, even an endorsement of the strategy moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But again, at this point, that is a theoretical, hypothetical exercise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I recognize the difference between a sign of progress and useful.\xc2\xa0 I recognize there\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction there.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the mission creep issue, you don\'t have to give me a number, but does the President have a number in mind of troops above which he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to go?\xc2\xa0 You\'ve at least said he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to send 150,000 American troops back.\xc2\xa0 So is there some number below that where he would say, no, forget it -- this is just not worth doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not one that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But I think the context for this debate is important, and you just laid it out, which is that there is a significant difference between 150,000 troops in a combat role and 3,500 U.S. troops in roles not in a combat role -- in a variety of other roles.\xc2\xa0 That is not in any way to downplay the kind of risk that these military\xc2\xa0servicemembers\xc2\xa0are assuming on behalf of our nation.\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\'t take that lightly.\xc2\xa0 I can guarantee you that the President of the United States does not take that lightly.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the way that the President makes decisions about the number of military personnel that are necessary in Iraq are not driven by an arbitrary consideration of round numbers, but rather are driven by the number of military personnel required to carry out what the President has ordered.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in this most recent case of expanding our training, advising and assisting mission to\xc2\xa0Taqaddum\xc2\xa0Air Base, the military planners put together essentially the scope of what the operation, that mission would look like at that air base.\xc2\xa0 And then they put forward what they believe was the necessary number of military personnel that would allow that operation to be -- or that mission to be successfully executed.\xc2\xa0 And it also factored in the number of support personnel, the number of security personnel and others that would be required there.\xc2\xa0 And that number is a little over 400 that would need to be at the base.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s ultimately the way these decisions are made.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not driven by the numbers on the front end.\xc2\xa0 It rather is a consideration of the policy recommendation that\'s been put forward by the national security team, and then the consideration about the number of military personnel that would be required to successfully and as safely as possible complete that mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just to follow up on that, when you talk about opening up a base at\xc2\xa0Taqaddum\xc2\xa0or the prospect of opening up further bases around Iraq, these would be Iraqi bases, would they not?\xc2\xa0 These would not be U.S. bases.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, these are bases that are in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And we do not envision the establishment of a military base in Iraq at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, because legally that would not be possible, correct?\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have a status of forces agreement.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have the legal architecture in place to open up U.S. bases in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re basically using their space?\xc2\xa0 Or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would acknowledge that I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the legal requirements of these kinds of agreements.\xc2\xa0 But again, to answer your question as precisely as I can, yes, these are Iraqi facilities where U.S. military personnel would go to carry out a train, advise and assist mission.\xc2\xa0 And there are five of those bases where that mission is taking place right now, inside of Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was talking about the prospect of opening up bases around Iraq, I suppose that some Americans may be confused as to what he was talking about, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about opening up U.S. military bases.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the exact transcript of his remarks.\xc2\xa0 It may be that he meant opening up those bases to U.S. military personnel where this training, advising and assisting operation could be carried out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about getting in the business of opening up U.S. military bases.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s been contemplated.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to ask you about the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has an interview today with the program, Extra.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s also been making some remarks -- he made some remarks yesterday in his speech and talked about this during the news conference in Germany.\xc2\xa0 And I was just curious, are you trying to communicate to the Supreme Court justices about what\xe2\x80\x99s at risk if the Affordable Care Act is gutted in King vs.\xc2\xa0Burwell?\xc2\xa0 It just almost feels like you jumped into campaign mode all of a sudden on\xc2\xa0Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, are you trying to reach to the justices there with some of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are a couple of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the President has, I think on a number of occasions, even in the context of some of his recent remarks, acknowledged that the decision in the King v.\xc2\xa0Burwell\xc2\xa0case will be a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by a separate but equal branch of government.\xc2\xa0 Those are the nine justices of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no Supreme Court watcher or expert, but my understanding about the way that these things typically go is that the opinions are typically written a number of days in advance of their eventual release.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, I say this not based on my own personal knowledge, but based on the advice that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received that, in all likelihood, the decision in this case has already been reached and written, and the Supreme Court is merely waiting for the day that they choose to announce the decision that they have made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so why is there such a focus on defending the program?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s five years old now.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s up and running.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President views this as a significant element -- or a significant achievement of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 And it has had an impact on millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just referring to the 16 million Americans who received health care after the Affordable Care Act took effect; I\xe2\x80\x99m actually referring also to the millions of other Americans across the country who benefit from the consumer protections that are included in the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat includes every single woman who has health insurance in the United States; they no longer have to be worried about being charged more just because they\xe2\x80\x99re a woman.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about every American in the United States that has a so-called preexisting condition; they never again have to be worried about being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about every single American who previously worried about hitting their lifetime cap because the Affordable Care Act -- an insurance company can no longer say that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to stop paying your benefits because you\xe2\x80\x99ve been too sick.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think reminding people of that progress and those important benefits is something that the President feels strongly about.\xc2\xa0 And even if there are no more Supreme Court cases between now and January of 2017, I would anticipate you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President make that case at least one more time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN that he\xe2\x80\x99s considering the idea of a rotating First Lady should he become President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not going to ask you to weigh in on that idea -- unless you would like to -- but to get at that question, I\'m just kind of curious what it would be like at the White House without a First Lady.\xc2\xa0 And would you be able to do everything that a White House does without a First Lady?\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s a huge -- the current First Lady has a very large ceremonial role and policy role at this White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s what occurs to me, Jim, is it\'s hard to -- at least it\'s hard to imagine this White House without this First Lady.\xc2\xa0 She obviously has played such an important role not just in carrying out the ceremonial aspects of her job, but also in advocating for the kinds of things that she and the President believe should be national priorities.\xc2\xa0 And these are things about making sure that our kids get off to a healthy start in life, and making sure that our military families have felt the full weight of support and gratitude that the American people have for the sacrifices that they have made for our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s hard for me to imagine both a Graham White House and what a Graham White House would be without a First Lady.\xc2\xa0 But I would obviously defer to the Senator to describe what that would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Among the opponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership are\xc2\xa0LGBT\xc2\xa0advocates who say the deal improperly opens up trade for countries that criminalize being\xc2\xa0LGBT.\xc2\xa0 In Malaysia,\xc2\xa0LGBT\xc2\xa0people can be imprisoned for 20 years or more.\xc2\xa0 In Brunei, the country recently enacted Sharia law which calls for death by stoning.\xc2\xa0 In an\xc2\xa0op-ed\xc2\xa0today in the Advocate, long-time\xc2\xa0LGBT\xc2\xa0rights activist Lee Jones and Pride at Work Director\xc2\xa0Jerame\xc2\xa0Davis said signing this deal will send a message to the world that you can abuse, imprison and kill\xc2\xa0LGBT\xc2\xa0people and still have preferential access to coveted U.S. markets.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I think the response that I would share with you is that we, obviously -- and the President has spoken publicly about the concerns that we have in terms of the way that other countries discriminate against people because of who they love.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases, these people aren\'t just discriminated against, they are subjected to terrible acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 And the President has used his moral authority to speak out against this rather aggressively.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in some cases, we know that there are countries where these kinds of conditions are in place.\xc2\xa0 And I think in the mind of the President, the question simply is, what are we going to do about it?\xc2\xa0 And there are some who legitimately advocate that we should try to isolate those countries and we should not talk to them, and we should not do any business with them, and we should not engage them because of those practices.\xc2\xa0 The President merely has a different approach, which is that the more successful we can be in engaging them both economically and culturally, and politically, and diplomatically, and militarily, in some cases the more effective we can be in advocating for the kinds of values that we prioritize in this country, and certainly the kinds of values the President has championed while sitting in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And I think that principle would apply in this case, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\'re so confident that opening up this deal could lead to improvement on the\xc2\xa0LGBT\xc2\xa0rights issues in these countries, why do you think these advocates are so steadfast against it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I think the argument that I\'m making is that I\'m confident that doing nothing is not the most effective way for us to press our case.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the argument that I\'m making.\xc2\xa0 And that, frankly, is the approach that some are advocating.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\'m not going to question their motives.\xc2\xa0 I know that they share the President\xe2\x80\x99s view about these kinds of cherished values and ensuring that people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be discriminated against or subjected to violence just because of who they love.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to trying to pressure other countries to live up to the kinds of values that we hold dear in this country is that we can do that more effectively by engaging them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on TPP and TAA, the House Republicans say they made several changes, which we\'ve just gone over, in consultation with Leader Pelosi, and that what is needed now is for Leader Pelosi to endorse those changes, be a public advocate on behalf of both TAA and TPA, and a stronger signal from this White House that all underlying issues have been dealt with and this is something that should go forward as is and Pelosi should lead that charge.\xc2\xa0 Are you prepared to do that?\xc2\xa0 They have a very good relationship, historically, the President and Minority Leader Pelosi.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 One of the foundations of that relationship is an acknowledgement that Leader Pelosi is going to vote her conscience and do what she thinks is right, and she knows the President is going to do the same thing.\xc2\xa0 And I think what has been a hallmark of that relationship is that their values and their vision for the country are so often, on a wide range of issues, very closely shared.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I will also say -- so I guess the point is that Speaker Boehner is welcome to make that case, but he should do that directly to Leader Pelosi.\xc2\xa0 And based on the kinds of conversations that is apparent that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had over the last few days, it sounds like that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the President, we have -- I think as is evident from the list of engagements that Jim ran through --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going on right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re going on right now.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Chief of Staff of the White House along with members of the Cabinet who are up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 The President had a conversation with Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that is not the only telephone call that the President will have with a member of Congress today.\xc2\xa0 So we will make our case to Democrats about -- principally to Democrats, but not exclusively to Democrats -- about why we believe this is the right approach, consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort to champion economic opportunity for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How comfortable are you and is the President with Leader Pelosi withholding her public position on this until tomorrow on the House floor?\xc2\xa0 Would not it be more helpful to what you just outlined, the cause of this advocacy, to have Leader Pelosi -- if, in fact, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to say yes -- say so now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is entirely within her rights to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the question.\xc2\xa0 Would it be helpful to you if what her conscience tells her were more clear to those in her caucus and in the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say as -- again, Major, it is entirely within her right to decide when she\xe2\x80\x99s ready to make public her position on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And the President and everyone here at the White House welcomes the support of everybody that we can get.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s any Republicans we can go to support this, as many Democrats as we can get to support this, up to and including the Democratic Leader.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 General\xc2\xa0Odierno\xc2\xa0said this morning that the battle against ISIS is a three-, five-, seven-, to 10-year project.\xc2\xa0 Is that a timeline the President believes in or the country should be prepared for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen -- I think the President has been as clear about this as he possibly can based on his own assessment of the situation, which is that this is not a short-term proposition.\xc2\xa0 It will require a long-term commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard someone who is as close to this as the Army Chief of Staff quite obviously is -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s close to it, but he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty close to it -- be that specific about the kind of timeline he believes this country ought to prepare itself for.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if the President thinks that\'s within the ballpark; that\'s something the country ought to brace for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And General\xc2\xa0Odierno\xc2\xa0obviously has spent not time -- not just time in his current role, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also spent a lot of time on the ground in Iraq, in the previous campaign in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And so he is somebody that brings significant knowledge.\xc2\xa0 So I obviously wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position to contradict him.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the best way that I can describe to you the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of the situation is to point you to what he said about it, which is that he does not believe -- or he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the American people to understand that this is not a short-term proposition and it will require a long-term commitment on the part of the United States and our coalition partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President has been just as clear about the fact that he does not envision a scenario where it is in the best interest of our country to engage in another large-scale ground operation -- ground combat operation inside of Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So without endorsing it specifically, you\'re not going to disagree with General\xc2\xa0Odierno?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 General\xc2\xa0Odierno, again, based on his own personal experience and expertise, has a lot of credibility when talking about these issues.\xc2\xa0 But the best way I can describe to you the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is what he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 General\xc2\xa0Odierno\xc2\xa0also said that this cannot be solved, the ISIS problem and the Iraq problem, until political reconciliation in the country takes hold, and that nothing really the Americans can do is going to solve that problem unless the Iraqis are prepared and willing to solve it themselves.\xc2\xa0 I presume you agree with that.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if you consider that problem bigger than ISIS itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause General\xc2\xa0Odierno\xc2\xa0said one of the reasons ISIS exists is because of so many decisions made by the\xc2\xa0Maliki\xc2\xa0government and the inability of Iraq to pull itself together after the United States left.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the bigger problem here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the point -- again, I think you were probably faithful in your paraphrasing of his comments.\xc2\xa0 I have confidence in that.\xc2\xa0 It seems to me the point that he\xe2\x80\x99s making and I think illustrating pretty clearly is it is impossible to separate the failed political leadership and divisive governing strategy of Prime Minister\xc2\xa0Maliki\xc2\xa0from the growth of\xc2\xa0ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And these are two problems that are interrelated.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have identified -- and this is something that shaped our involvement in this matter from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0made their rapid, stark advance across the desert from Syria into Iraq, there were many who were suggesting that the President should be aggressively engaged in the effort to try to prevent that, to try to blunt that advance, and urged an aggressive commitment of resources to do that.\xc2\xa0 And the President was very limited in doing that for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 He did prioritize the protection of military personnel in Iraq, and so we did take steps to ensure their safety.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President also said I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to make a more significant commitment in Iraq until it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Iraqi central government is willing to commit to govern that country in an inclusive way.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have been gratified to see Prime Minister\xc2\xa0Abadi, at least in the first 10 months or so that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office, live up to the kind of commitment that he made on the front end to unify Iraq, to face down the threat from\xc2\xa0ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has committed to governing the country in a multi-sectarian way.\xc2\xa0 That\'s clear from the way that his cabinet has been assembled and the way that they have governed the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been clear from the way that he has attempted to build a multi-sectarian force to take on\xc2\xa0ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s living up to those early promises.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is you demonstrate your commitment to these kinds of principles not just in the matter of weeks or months, but over a sustained period of time.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to continue to watch closely the commitment of the Iraqi central government to unifying the country.\xc2\xa0 But there is no doubt that an inclusive central government in Baghdad is integral to their ability to deal with the\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0problem.\xc2\xa0 There is no denying that fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why the administration is going to continue to be supportive of steps that the Iraqi government takes to try to unify that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 The new plan yesterday, or the retooled plan envisions trying to tighten the border of Syria and Turkey to prevent the flow of -- or at least slow the flow of foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 There are many who are familiar with that situation who believe the\xc2\xa0Erdo\xc4\x9fan\xc2\xa0government has given the U.S. almost no assistance, has turned a blind eye to this entire issue, people who are very close to it.\xc2\xa0 There was obviously a parliamentary election that was a setback for the\xc2\xa0Erdo\xc4\x9fan\xc2\xa0government earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a coalition government.\xc2\xa0 In general, does this administration believe that election result will make\xc2\xa0Erdo\xc4\x9fan\xc2\xa0more or less compliant as this new phase of trying to stop foreign fighters begins?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see, Major.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President took this on pretty directly in the news conference that he did in Germany on Monday, where he indicated that there\xe2\x80\x99s more that we would like to see Turkey do to coordinate with our broader international coalition to shut down the flow of foreign fighters to\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0and to Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By more, you mean something.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are steps that Turkey has taken to demonstrate their willingness to be constructive here, but there is a lot more that we believe they can and should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to kind of follow up on something Major was talking about, and refer you to another military leader who obviously is intimately aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening on the ground\xc2\xa0vis-\xc3\xa0-vis\xc2\xa0the battle with ISIS.\xc2\xa0 General Michael Flynn who was on with Neil\xc2\xa0Cavuto\xc2\xa0yesterday, said some pretty interesting things.\xc2\xa0 Among them, he was asked if he thought ISIS was winning and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think ISIS is achieving the objectives they have set out to achieve.\xc2\xa0 I think they feel probably very emboldened, they feel pretty good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m just curious, when you hear something like that from someone who is so intimately aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there in Iraq, how do you absorb that?\xc2\xa0 Do you dismiss it outright?\xc2\xa0 Or do you simply take information like that and say, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat of a reflection of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very blunt about what our assessment is of the situation on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 And specifically, there have been areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress, and that includes retaking the\xc2\xa0Anbar\xc2\xa0town of\xc2\xa0Baghdadi\xc2\xa0to retaking -- driving\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0out of\xc2\xa0Tikrit.\xc2\xa0 Even thinking back to last summer, there was a rapid advance of\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0fighters across the desert in Iraq where they appeared to be encroaching on\xc2\xa0Erbil, and that was an offensive that was blunted. And principally by working with Kurdish security forces and being backed by coalition military\xc2\xa0airpower, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t just blunted that offensive but they\xe2\x80\x99ve started to roll back many of those gains.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been pretty forthright in acknowledging that there have been areas where we and the Iraqis have sustained setbacks, and\xc2\xa0Ramadi\xc2\xa0is the best example of that. But that is the nature of any kind of military conflict and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been the nature of this conflict as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the President has directed his national security team to focus on is to make sure that we have a strategy that reflects that environment on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you saw this announcement yesterday about the decision to open up an additional Iraqi base in\xc2\xa0Anbar\xc2\xa0Province where American military personnel would go about carrying out a mission to train, advise and assist Iraqi fighters.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to do, and that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground and consistent with the kinds of strategic choices the President believes are most likely to yield success.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you use the expression \xe2\x80\x9ctrain\xe2\x80\x9d primarily, although today, you say, \xe2\x80\x9ctrain, advise and assist.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon, for the most part, has simply been saying they are there to advise.\xc2\xa0 Is there any space between the two descriptions, or is it all one fell swoop of a description of what they\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing on the 450 additional U.S. personnel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, what I can say is that the mission that the President authorized is a mission to train, advise and assist those forces that are fighting under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 And that means both members of the Iraqi security forces; it also means those Sunni tribal fighters that had been recruited into the fight to fight under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what their mission is.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s been described by both the Pentagon and the White House and the State Department, for that matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with what we have broadly said about the commitment of the United States and our coalition partners to support the efforts of the Iraqis to take the fight on the ground to\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about the idea of using grants, essentially to help diversity some affluent areas.\xc2\xa0 I was reading about that today.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me what the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is on that and why that seems like a good idea to sort of give communities, if nothing else, an opportunity to advance and move up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about the U.N. Stabilization Fund?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The idea here is essentially that there is more support that we need to offer those Iraqi communities that have driven out\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0and that if we want to make sure that we can prevent\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0from encroaching on those cities, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to just be able to provide security to those cities or those towns\xc2\xa0 -- we do -- we also need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re building up the capacity of local governance structures to govern those areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, our strategy is predicated on this idea that we want to build up the capacity of Iraqis to do for themselves what we will not do for them, and that is to govern and provide security for the communities and their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, when you say \xe2\x80\x9cwe want to help them win their fight for their country\xe2\x80\x9d and others argue sometimes, well, you\xe2\x80\x99re not in it to win it -- is that a frustration for the White House when you hear that?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems to me you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help them, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to win it yourself.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m telling you, Kevin, is that the fight against\xc2\xa0ISIL\xc2\xa0is one that the Iraqi people must do for themselves. They can do that with the strong support of the United States and our coalition partners, and there are a variety of ways that we can support them, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with military coalition\xc2\xa0airstrikes, or offering training, advising, and assisting of Iraqi fighters that are operating under the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 It also is engaging in an effort to shut down the flow of foreign fighters that are filling the ranks of\xc2\xa0ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It also is undertaking efforts with our coalition partners to try to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to finance their operations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of those are things that will eventually benefit the Iraqis as they fight a war that they must fight for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tAngela.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously had some sharp words to say about Greece in his press conference on Monday.\xc2\xa0 And today, U.N. President Donald Tusk seems to have finally reached a tipping point on Greece -- his very, very harsh words.\xc2\xa0 And the IMF negotiating team left Brussels with no deal.\xc2\xa0 Are we likely to hear any more from the President on Greece?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything he\xe2\x80\x99s doing behind the scenes?\xc2\xa0 And what does he see as his role in that crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Angela, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that you\xe2\x80\x99ll necessarily see the President weigh in on this again -- although, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that one of you could ask him.\xc2\xa0 But our view -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s a view that we have pretty consistently articulated -- is that we want all sides to continue to focus on finding pragmatic solutions that will allow Greece to chart a path to recovery.\xc2\xa0 Now, that also means that Greece must pursue some of the kinds of structural reforms that they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to.\xc2\xa0 And this is part of the -- this is the essence of the negotiation that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing right now between Greece and their creditors.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the role of the United States -- and this is something that Secretary Lew has been leading on the part of the United States -- is to encourage all sides to come to an agreement in order to prevent some kind of broader default that would destabilize the global economy and have a possible negative impact on the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Secretary Lew, over the last couple of weeks, has met with his G7 finance minister counterparts to discuss this issue; Secretary Lew had the opportunity to talk to Prime Minister\xc2\xa0Tsipras\xc2\xa0of Greece about some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 But that essentially is our view of the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a lighter question, the President taped an interview earlier today with -- I get this right -- Extra TV.\xc2\xa0 It airs at apparently 2:07 a.m. Eastern time tonight, tomorrow morning.\xc2\xa0 Just curious, how does this fit into the communications strategy? Who is the President trying to reach by doing that kind of show?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Insomniacs.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The fact is that this is part of our sustained effort to try to use a variety of channels to communicate with the American public.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity -- I would encourage you to take a look at the interview.\xc2\xa0 Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a way for you to get it from a different market so you don\'t have to stay up until 2:07 a.m. here in East Coast.\xc2\xa0 But this is something -- this is an opportunity for the President to deliver a message about just how valuable the Affordable Care Act has been not just to the 16 million Americans who got health care after the Affordable Care Act, but from the millions, hundreds of millions of Americans who have\xc2\xa0benefitted\xc2\xa0from the critically important consumer protections that were included in the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s everything from ensuring that women can\'t be charged more for their health insurance just because they\'re a woman.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t be discriminated against because you have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 And you no longer have to be worried about hitting your lifetime limit that would essentially result in the insurance company kicking you off your insurance because you got really sick.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you about a question and the White House response to the GOP threatening to withhold $700 million in funding for the State Department because they feel that information is not being given quick enough and effectively enough in reference to Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s documentation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I think what it does is it just calls into question the sincerity of those Republicans who are advocating for additional security at U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.\xc2\xa0 The fact is if they believe that\'s a priority, then you would think that they would want to ensure that those security operations and those security measures are properly and fully funded.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m no budgetary expert, but it seems hard for me to believe that taking that big of a chunk out of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s budget is not going to have an impact on the safety and security at U.S. diplomatic facilities around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, the only reason that they claim that they\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in this debate -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested that politics are chiefly to blame -- they claim that they care about making security for our diplomats a priority.\xc2\xa0 But if they actually cared about that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be threatening to withhold funding for security for our diplomats.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo anyway, I guess that\'s my reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your reaction.\xc2\xa0 Seven hundred million dollars is a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 You say safety and security. Specifically, would it really -- would it actually take security officers away from embassies, away from diplomats and things of that nature?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the precise budgetary impact. I think what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that -- what I was trying to convey is it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have some kind of impact on the efforts to provide security at diplomatic installations around the world.\xc2\xa0 But for those kinds of details, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bill Press, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a couple of quick ones.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, who are the top three leading candidates for the new Librarian of Congress?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements to make at this time.\xc2\xa0 But maybe that\'s something -- well, I was going to suggest that might be something you could check out later.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ooooh\xc2\xa0--</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 See, I tried to stop, and you guys were all goading me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were looking forward to that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, it just came to me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to the trade for a second.\xc2\xa0 The Democratic members that I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to say that the vote on Medicare is not as simple as you described it at the top of the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a process by which once they vote to cut Medicare, then there\xe2\x80\x99s a process by which their vote won\xe2\x80\x99t really count.\xc2\xa0 So that leaves them in the position of going to voters next year and saying, yes, I voted to cut Medicare, but I was promised that vote wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t count.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair place to put Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a fair description of what exactly would happen on the floor.\xc2\xa0 And I am, by no means, a legislative expert, but I asked this direct question to somebody who is a legislative expert on our staff.\xc2\xa0 And what they were able to confirm to me is, based on the way the rule is structured -- I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at some self-described legislative experts down here -- the way that the rule is structured, that it would not force Democrats to take a vote that could legitimately be described as cutting Medicare.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what these Democratic members, who are experts, told me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that this is actually the nature of a number of the conversations that we\'re having with members of Congress on Capitol Hill to make sure that they actually understand the way that this rule works, and the way that they understand how their vote can be described.\xc2\xa0 They have strongly held views on this.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly understandable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why -- because of the aggressive advocacy of Leader Pelosi and because of the reasonableness, frankly, of Speaker Boehner in this instance, that they went to great lengths to address this particular concern.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one with strong views on that, Congresswoman Rosa\xc2\xa0DeLauro, told members, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you vote for this you could lose your job.\xc2\xa0 Period.\xc2\xa0 End of story.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is she wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that members of Congress should be more concerned about the jobs of Americans than their own jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly why the President has sought to advance this trade legislation, because he believes it is clearly in the best interest of middle-class families and middle-class workers.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s particularly true when we\'re talking about trade adjustment assistance legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I mentioned earlier, those members of Congress who vote against this trade adjustment assistance bill are adding their name to the death certificate for trade adjustment assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrade adjustment assistance will expire at the end of the year, and Speaker Boehner has made clear -- again, he has made clear, and I think for good reason -- most Republicans don\'t support trade adjustment assistance -- he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that this is the best chance that Democrats will have, probably the only chance Democrats will have, to renew this critically important piece of legislation before it expires.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s the nature of the conversations that are ongoing at the White House here today.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:09 P.M.
