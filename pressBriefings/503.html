EDT</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One this morning as we make our way to the great state of Pennsylvania, or Commonwealth, rather.\xc2\xa0 And, as you know, the President has an event today and he\'ll be joined by the Vice President to talk about skills development and training.\xc2\xa0 And I have with me for this briefing, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is have Secretary Pritzker talk to you a little bit about what the President will be doing at today\xe2\x80\x99s event and the broader agenda.\xc2\xa0 Then she can take questions on those subjects, and then I\'ll stay for questions on other subjects, if you have any.</p>\n<p class="p2">And with that, I give you Secretary Pritzker.</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 How are you?\xc2\xa0 Let me just give a little bit of background and, first of all, talking about skills and workforce training.\xc2\xa0 This is a subject that\xe2\x80\x99s very personal to me.\xc2\xa0 I started working on this in 2009 when Rahm Emanuel was chief of staff, and we started and created something called Skills for America\xe2\x80\x99s Future, which was a White House initiative in partnership with the Aspen Institute.\xc2\xa0 And then in 2012, we created something called Skills for Chicagoland\xe2\x80\x99s Future, which is a workforce intermediary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And the fundamental premise here is that we have to engage with businesses in order to get workers the skills that they need.\xc2\xa0 And businesses need to define the skillsets that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for in order to meet their needs.\xc2\xa0 To do this you have to break silos; we have to break down silos between businesses, between the community colleges and the other workforce training organizations, the universities and local governments in order to deliver these skills.</p>\n<p class="p2">Today what we\'re doing is we\'re announcing incentives that will help -- that will expand upon something that\'s a fact:\xc2\xa0 American business today spends $400 billion training their own workers.\xc2\xa0 What we want to do is incentivize them to take that training and make it available to others in the community through partnerships with community colleges, through increasing the number of workforce intermediaries, through expanding the number of apprenticeship programs, and also through -- to create and emphasize the value of industry-recognized, portable, stackable credentials.\xc2\xa0 So having industry and industry associations work to create credentials that are recognized across the country and that have real value for a worker who\xe2\x80\x99s getting those credentials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And today is all about the scaling what works.\xc2\xa0 We have two programs that we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing today:\xc2\xa0 a $500 million tax grant program that will start taking applications today; and those applications will be due July 7th.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s new about this program is it\'s an incentive to scale, because the applications will have -- each of the applicants have to work with a national industry association.</p>\n<p class="p3">The second thing is it builds upon something that\xe2\x80\x99s been part of tax grants, which is that the community colleges have to partner with employers when they make their applications.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The second program is a program focused -- $100 million that will start in the fall, focused on apprenticeships.\xc2\xa0 The United States is falling behind in the number of apprenticeships that we have compared to our global competitors.\xc2\xa0 And so the goal is to expand the number of apprenticeship programs and also to award new models of apprenticeships.</p>\n<p class="p2">So if you think of, historically, apprenticeships have been mostly in the trades.\xc2\xa0 But we want to do apprenticeships in advanced manufacturing, in IT, in health care in sectors of our economy that are growing.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s really cool is this builds upon work that is being done by the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, which is an effort that\xe2\x80\x99s co-chaired by me and by the head of the NEC, Jeff Zients.\xc2\xa0 And so simultaneously, today, Dow, Alcoa and Siemens are going to announce two new apprenticeship programs:\xc2\xa0 One that\xe2\x80\x99s in northern California for welders, and one that\xe2\x80\x99s in southern Texas for maintenance technicians.</p>\n<p class="p2">And then South Central College in Minneapolis is going to work with the 24 colleges that exist in Minnesota to develop apprenticeships in mechatronics.\xc2\xa0 And then Harper College, which is based outside of Chicago, another community college, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to create college credit for vets, for our veterans, that also contain apprenticeships attached in advanced manufacturing, including logistics and supply chain management.\xc2\xa0 And then the AMP leadership is also going to create a how-to manual as to how to then replicate these types of programs.</p>\n<p class="p2">And, as you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget calls for $2 billion in funding for apprenticeships.\xc2\xa0 These programs are all ways for us to get started today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any way to quantify how many people will be helped by what\xe2\x80\x99s being announced today?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 That question was asked yesterday, and the NEC is working with Labor.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll know once the grants are completed; they have to estimate the number of people that they\xe2\x80\x99ll help.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say there\xe2\x80\x99s $2 billion?\xc2\xa0 Would that be in the budget proposals for apprenticeships?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 -- in the budget proposal for apprenticeships, yes. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a similar question -- did you say that American businesses spend $400 billion --\xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p class="p3">SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 Billion dollars training their own workers.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The apprenticeships -- like, how many of those will be available?\xc2\xa0 To anyone at any university, or any level of education?\xc2\xa0 Or is it only community colleges that people apply\xc2\xa0 through?</p>\n<p class="p2">SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 The idea is to use these programs and replicate them -- replicate the ones that work.\xc2\xa0 What we do know is 87 percent of people who go through apprenticeship programs end up with jobs.</p>\n<p class="p3">Anything else?\xc2\xa0 All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand you back over.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Any other questions?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the status of your decision on a non-lethal aid package for Ukraine?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re actively considering forms of assistance, the kinds of assistance that we may be able to provide to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing requests from the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 As I indicated yesterday, we are not considering lethal assistance, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to itemize the types of assistance that are under consideration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I would note that just the other day Secretary Lew and his Ukrainian counterpart signed an agreement that allows for the provision of up to $1 billion of loan guarantees to Ukraine, and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of our effort to help Ukraine stabilize its economy as it focuses on moving forward towards national elections on May 25.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction from the White House to NATO\xe2\x80\x99s decision to increase its military footprint there in the eastern part of --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously a significant member of NATO and fully endorse the actions that the Alliance has taken to reassure NATO members and to bolster NATO\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the Baltic nations.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the meeting tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 What is the United States expecting out of that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what are your expectations?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Secretary Kerry, as you know, is on his way now to Geneva for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with officials from the Ukrainian government, the Russian government and the European Union.\xc2\xa0 This will be the first opportunity for this contact group to meet.\xc2\xa0 And we expect the conversation to focus on the need to deescalate, the need for Russia to demobilize its troop presence on the border with Ukraine, the need for armed separatist groups within Ukraine to disband and disarm, and for the Ukrainian government to discuss the measures it intends to take when it comes to constitutional reform and decentralization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So it\xe2\x80\x99s an important meeting, but it is also important to note that talk is one thing but action is another.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to call on Russia to take action that deescalates the situation and the tensions in Ukraine by returning its forces to their pre-crisis positions and numbers; moving its forces from the Ukrainian border as well from Crimea; ceasing its support for armed separatist groups that have seized government buildings, blockaded roads and stockpiled weapons in eastern Ukraine; and engage directly in a dialogue with Ukraine about its concerns when it comes to ethnic Russians in parts of Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has the administration briefed any U.S. companies doing business in Russia on the effect of additional sanctions?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 You might want to ask the Department of Treasury when it comes to those kinds of discussions.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration urged any companies to pull back on business that they do with Russia to help magnify the government sanctions?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We take concrete actions authorized through the executive orders the President has signed.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the sanctions that have been imposed, and I can tell you that we are actively reviewing further sanctions at this time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you prepared to impose these new sanctions based on the results of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are actively preparing new sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We are also looking at tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting for an indication that Russia will, or intends to pursue a path of deescalation rather than escalation.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does it feel like events in eastern Ukraine are spinning out of control?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen separatists take command of some of the armored personnel carriers and waving Russian flags.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in terms of the actions by armed separatists in eastern Ukraine has been destabilizing in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And as I noted earlier in the week, these groups have clearly coordinated their actions and received support from the outside.\xc2\xa0 And in many cases they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the support in any visible way of the populations in the cities or regions where they\xe2\x80\x99re occupying buildings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The best way to deescalate the situation in Ukraine is for these armed separatists to disband and disarm.\xc2\xa0 And we, again, note the fact that the Ukrainian government has approached this serious challenge in a measured and responsible way.\xc2\xa0 These provocations are clearly designed to destabilize the country, and the Ukrainian government has responded with admirable restraint.\xc2\xa0 And I say that while also acknowledging that it is certainly appropriate for Ukraine to take action to restore law and order, but we believe that they should continue to do so in a measured and responsible way.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on another topic, there are reports out of negotiations in Michigan, in Detroit, to move $100 million of federal funds from state to help relieve blight in Detroit, thus I guess alleviating or freeing another $100 million to help the pensions there.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm those meetings?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on them?\xc2\xa0 And is that counter to the President\xe2\x80\x99s explicit, I guess, words that he would not relieve pensions in flailing cities?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the reports so I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer any comment on them, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on sanctions, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The State Department said today that we have additional sanctions prepared.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re all ready to go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly had the opportunity to review the options available to us when it comes to imposing new sanctions, and that work has been ongoing over the past weeks since the President signed the second of two executive orders.\xc2\xa0 So it is accurate to say that we have additional sanctions prepared, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll impose them as appropriate.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have updates on the sinking of the South Korean ferry ship?\xc2\xa0 Any updated information or anything?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 Let me just check here.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will be there next week.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, and our deepest condolences go out to the loved one of those who lost lives onboard the South Korean ferry.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. stands ready to provide any assistance needed.\xc2\xa0 The 7th Fleet is ready to assist with the search-and-rescue effort, and the USS Bonhomme Richard has moved to the area to assist the Republic of Korea with search-and-rescue operations.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Bonhomme Richard?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, here\xe2\x80\x99s the spelling.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s French. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The French.\xc2\xa0 Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re embarrassing me, but yes it looks like we have a ship with a French name.\xc2\xa0 Bonhomme Richard.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the sanctions, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about sanctions against the key sectors of the Russian economy, are you?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to elaborate until we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to announce new sanctions what the next step in sanctioning will be.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the authorities provided by the executive orders give us a great deal of flexibility when it comes to imposing sanctions on individuals, on entities, and authorizes the Treasury Department to identify sectors of the economy that can be sanctioned.</p>\n<p class="p3">I think the authorities that we have are flexible because the President wanted to be able to impose costs on Russia commensurate with the action that Russia has taken.\xc2\xa0 In other words, if and as Russia escalates, the cost will escalate as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talks in Geneva are scheduled for just tomorrow, right?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, but the State Department might have more information.\xc2\xa0 I understand that Secretary Kerry will also meet with Lady Ashton and his Ukrainian counterpart, as well as at least -- probably as well as Foreign Minister Lavrov.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They could be extended if there were to be something --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 I think, at least as far as I know, the plan is for meetings tomorrow.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the sanctions be likely to be imposed before or after the meeting tomorrow?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to impose new sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously focused on finding a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, and that is the purpose of the meeting tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So we are going to participate in that meeting with an eye towards evaluating whether or not Russia is serious about deescalating, or whether or not Russia will acknowledge that the Ukrainian government has in a very responsible way taken steps to commit itself to constitutional reform and to making changes when it comes to the centralized nature of authority within Ukraine, to decentralize it to the regions.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be looking for in this meeting.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, all.</p>\n<p class="p4">END<br/>\n\t2:34 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
