Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">1:08 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements at the top, so, Mr. Lederman, would you like to get us started?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about Nurse Nina Pham\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the White House this afternoon.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems like a pretty powerful image having her in the Oval Office really just hours after being discharged.\xc2\xa0 I assume this is designed to reassure people of the President\xe2\x80\x99s confidence that there\xe2\x80\x99s no danger to the public from people who are not symptomatic with Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That certainly is a medical fact.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what our experts tell us.\xc2\xa0 I think this also should be a pretty apt reminder that we do have the best medical infrastructure in the world, and certainly a medical infrastructure that\'s in place to protect the American public.\xc2\xa0 And the track record of treating Ebola patients in this country is very strong, particularly for those who are quickly diagnosed and admitted through the system.</p>\n<p class="p2">So this is a testament today to a young woman who, over the course of doing her job and treating an Ebola patient, got sick.\xc2\xa0 And she was doing the work that many nurses do on a daily basis, and she did so even though it did put her at some personal risk.\xc2\xa0 And what she did, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it because she was promised a raise; she didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it because it was glamorous.\xc2\xa0 She did it because she\xe2\x80\x99s committed to her profession and she was committed to treating an individual who was sick, and she was prepared to use her training to try to meet that person\xe2\x80\x99s needs.</p>\n<p class="p2">So the fact that she has been treated and released I think is terrific news and I think answers the prayers of many people across the country today.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s response to the diagnosis of an Ebola patient in New York City?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that has been done in recent days has proved to be very useful.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there are -- earlier this week, medical professionals conducted a training for health care workers at the Javits Center in New York to ensure that they had all of the training that they needed to understand what was necessary to treat an Ebola patient in a way that was safe for them and safe for the broader community.\xc2\xa0 That certainly looks like prudent planning in hindsight.</p>\n<p class="p2">The other thing that has been underway for some time is the President had designated five airports where individuals who were traveling from West Africa could enter the country.\xc2\xa0 By funneling these passengers to those five airports we were able to marshal the appropriate resources that were necessary to apply an additional layer of screening for those individuals who had traveled recently in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 In conjunction with that, state and local officials had worked to identify hospitals in the same region of each of these airports where patients who are sick could be directed.</p>\n<p class="p2">So Bellevue Hospital in New York was the hospital that had been identified as the hospital where patients who -- or where passengers who were detected with a higher fever or otherwise sick would be sent as they\xe2\x80\x99re coming off the airplane.\xc2\xa0 So Bellevue is a place where significant planning had already been done to ensure that protocols were in place to treat Ebola patients.\xc2\xa0 I understand that Bellevue had been designated both by the state and city as one of eight medical facilities in the state of New York that was prepared to treat Ebola patients.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of training and planning went into that.</p>\n<p class="p2">In fact, I also understand that when Dr. Spencer was admitted to Bellevue Hospital yesterday, there actually happened to be a team of CDC experts already at the hospital evaluating that hospital, making sure that they were up to the needed standards to treat an Ebola patient.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Consistent with the order that the President gave last week for CDC to organize a SWAT team of CDC experts to rapidly deploy to a hospital where an Ebola patient had been identified, I\xe2\x80\x99m told that this SWAT team actually arrived in New York last night, the same evening that this individual was a confirmed Ebola patient.</p>\n<p class="p3">We had experts on the ground in New York working side by side with hospital administrators and health care professionals at Bellevue Hospital to ensure that the strengthened protocols that the CDC announced earlier this week were in place so that this individual could get high-quality treatment, and that that treatment could be administered in a way that the risk to health care workers was not significantly elevated.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about Bellevue being one of these designated hospitals to treat Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Would you like every state to designate hospitals particularly to treat Ebola?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this I think is an indication of the solid preparation that was put in place by state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio I think deserve a lot of credit for the effort that they put into ensuring that New York was prepared to deal with a situation like this.</p>\n<p class="p3">We certainly value the strong working relationship that already exists between federal officials and medical experts in the federal government and state and local officials across the country.\xc2\xa0 That working relationship has been important.\xc2\xa0 It will continue to be important as we deal with this situation.</p>\n<p class="p3">So far, what we have worked with state officials to do is to ensure, as I mentioned earlier, that hospitals are in region -- in the same region as the airports where individuals traveling from West Africa are arriving in this country; that those hospitals are prepared and have the training and information and equipment that they need to receive patients that may test positive for Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p3">So that is the kind of detailed planning that\xe2\x80\x99s been done.\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen is the CDC offer up strengthened guidance to health care workers and public health officials all across the country to give them guidance about what they should do to prepare to treat an Ebola patient.</p>\n<p class="p3">That all said, we continue to believe to this day that -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean our medical experts continue to believe to this day that the risk of a widespread Ebola outbreak in the United States continues to be exceedingly low.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Dr. Fauci this morning said that a mandatory quarantine for people returning from the Ebola hot zone in West Africa was something that\xe2\x80\x99s under very active discussion.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about those discussions and what that might look like?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the protocols that guide the restrictions that are placed on individuals that are returning from West Africa are driven by the best scientific advice that we can get.\xc2\xa0 We have our medical experts and our scientists looking carefully at how we treat Ebola patients and how we can do that in a way that protects the American public and in a way that protects health care workers who are rendering lifesaving aid.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to rely on that advice as we regularly update and review procedures as necessary to protect the American public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that one of the strengthened measures that was announced just this week was the intention of CDC to share contact information with state and local officials so that state and local officials could take the necessary steps to protect the public when it comes to individuals who have returned to the U.S. after having recently traveled in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the kind of beefed-up procedures that the CDC has put in place to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to protect the American public.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And briefly, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans next week to campaign really across the country for some Democratic candidates for governor, despite this push at the end for governors, the President only did one fundraiser this year for the Democratic Governors Association; I think it was back in February.\xc2\xa0 And really the focus of his fundraising has been for House and Senate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, if governors\xe2\x80\x99 races are so important to the President, to the party this year, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he do more earlier in the year to help raise money for them?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you point out, Josh, the President has done a number of things to boost the candidacy of Democratic candidates up and down the ballot all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And the President has worked to try to boost the candidacy of Democratic governors who are running for reelection or candidates for governor who are Democrats.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">In terms of the exact fundraising strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s deployed by the DGA, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them about what sort of requests they made.\xc2\xa0 I, frankly, don\xe2\x80\x99t have off the top of my head about whether or not the President signed the emails to help raise money via the Internet for candidates for governor.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that certainly Democratic candidates, like others, benefit from the kinds of resources that the President raised for the Democratic Congressional Committee.\xc2\xa0 We have the party working very aggressively to benefit Democrats up and down the ballot, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one way in which they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit from the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement.\xc2\xa0 But we also anticipate that the events that the President will be hosting over the course of next week will also significantly benefit those campaigns as well.</p>\n<p class="p2">Roberta.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the administration feel that the post-arrival monitoring that the CDC announced earlier this week is enough?\xc2\xa0 Or how much thought is being given to people also needing to agree to stay in some kind of self-isolation or self-quarantine once they arrive back from the hot zone?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do anticipate that -- we do expect that these active monitoring procedures that are in place for individuals who have recently traveled in West Africa will be in place on Monday.\xc2\xa0 So those measures are being ramped up.\xc2\xa0 But we do continue to have confidence -- as I believe Mayor de Blasio and the public health commissioner in New York stated yesterday -- that the risk facing the people of New York continues to be exceedingly low.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We understand from reports that subway traffic today was typical for a Friday.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the people of New York are feeling confident, as they should, about their safety as they go about their daily business.\xc2\xa0 They should, because Dr. Spencer, as we discussed, is somebody who upon return from West Africa was screened at the airport.\xc2\xa0 And when he was screened at the airport, it was determined that he did not have a temperature.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s significant because we know that the only way that you can contract Ebola is by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who is exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Spencer, when he flew on a plane, did not have any symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned at all about the risk facing people who may have been on that airplane.</p>\n<p class="p2">Since he returned, Dr. Spencer was regularly taking his temperature and monitoring his health.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as it became clear that his temperature was elevated, he contacted medical authorities.\xc2\xa0 These were medical authorities who, as I mentioned to Josh, had recently been trained in the protocols that are necessary to detect and isolate an Ebola patient.\xc2\xa0 So those medical authorities responded promptly in accordance with protocols.\xc2\xa0 He was transferred to Bellevue Hospital, a hospital that had been preparing for weeks to receive a possible Ebola patient.\xc2\xa0 He was appropriately isolated, and he started receiving treatment while he was being tested for the Ebola virus.</p>\n<p class="p2">So this is an indication that this kind of planning and preparation will be very important to the successful treatment of Ebola patients and the continued safety of the people of America and, in this case, the people of New York City.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, so he did all those things as you laid out, but what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do, it seems that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t self-isolate.\xc2\xa0 He went out into the community to the limited degree that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been reading about.\xc2\xa0 So is that something that the administration is considering requiring people who come back to do?\xc2\xa0 To self-isolate, to stay indoors or stay in their homes, or some additional measure?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re always reviewing and assessing the protocols that are in place.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is the CDC is doing the necessary contact tracing, but our experts tell us that -- and as a result of that contact tracing I think that there are a couple of people that have been isolated.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low, and the reason for that is that this is an individual who was monitoring his health very closely.</p>\n<p class="p2">And again, what we know about Ebola is very clearly about the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s transmitted.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only transmitted when an individual comes in close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who has symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 That is why I think it is instructive for people to take note of the fact that we only have two instances where the Ebola virus has been transmitted inside the United States, and those are instances where you had health care workers who were treating a very sick Ebola patient.\xc2\xa0 And that obviously is very different than the kind of day-to-day encounters that people have as they go about their business in public.</p>\n<p class="p2">So that is why the risk that is facing the people of New York and people of America continues at this point to be exceedingly low according to our medical experts.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just briefly, is the administration considering requiring people who have been in a hot zone to complete a quarantine before coming back to America?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into sort of the ongoing deliberations of our public health professionals.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that these kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science and by the best advice of our medical experts, and by our scientists that have four decades of experience in dealing with Ebola outbreaks in West Africa.</p>\n<p class="p2">So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got teams on the ground at Bellevue Hospital that have experience in infection control, that have experience in limiting infection control inside medical facilities. \xc2\xa0These are individuals that have an expertise in treating the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking the necessary steps that they can treat Dr. Spencer in a way that will protect the public and the health care workers who are rendering him aid. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Olivier.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, one question and one housekeeping item.\xc2\xa0 The question is, when someone who has beaten Ebola comes to see the President in the Oval Office, are there additional layers of precautions taken?\xc2\xa0 Do they undergo -- is there a White House overseeing medical checkup to double -- just to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re, in fact, clear of this?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 As Dr. Fauci noted in his news conference that I caught part of earlier today, Ms. Pham was tested five different times to confirm that she no longer had the virus.\xc2\xa0 So all the necessary testing that allows her to safely return home with a clean bill of health is the same guidance that she has gotten in terms of meeting the President.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the housekeeping item -- I would like to ask the White House, through you, to open the 1:30 event -- obviously, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re very, very close now -- open this event to the full complement of print, television and radio reporters who would typically cover an event like this.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In this case, we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to do the still photographers.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you explain why?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it out of concern for her?\xc2\xa0 To me, it seems like it reduces the magnitude of this event a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Nothing against our stills brethren, obviously.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I think in this case we determined that the still photographers would provide the access that was necessary to ensure that you and the American people were informed about this event.</p>\n<p class="p2">Juliet.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t get into great details about the policy deliberations on quarantining returning medical personnel, but can you talk about some of the balancing act that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at, for example, whether a quarantine upon return to the United States would affect the ongoing international effort to stop Ebola at its source?\xc2\xa0 Could you just -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern among folks that between cutting commercial traffic, changes in insurance policies and something like this, that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming more difficult to get volunteers to go to the region.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Juliet, you, as usual, raise a really important point, which is Dr. Spencer is somebody who, as I alluded to earlier, volunteered his time to treat people with Ebola in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly sound like a luxurious vacation.\xc2\xa0 But this is somebody who was prepared to use his skills as a doctor to try to meet the needs of those who are far less fortunate than we are.\xc2\xa0 And that is I think a pretty astounding display of generosity and charity and goodwill.\xc2\xa0 It certainly reflects the spirit of the American people that we are willing to selflessly try to meet the needs of those who are less fortunate.</p>\n<p class="p3">At the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just charity, though, because we know that the only way that we can entirely eliminate the risk to the American people from the Ebola virus is to stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 And in order to stop this outbreak at the source in West Africa, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to surge personnel and supplies to stop this outbreak.</p>\n<p class="p3">So we are certainly appreciative of what Dr. Spencer has done, not because it respects -- not only because it reflects the true spirit of America, but also it reflects the commitment that\xe2\x80\x99s required to stop this Ebola outbreak at the source.</p>\n<p class="p3">And I guess to answer your question more directly, we do want to ensure that whatever policies we put in place takes as the first priority the protection of the American public.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to try to serve their fellow man and stop this outbreak at the source, which ultimately is in the best interest of the American people.</p>\n<p class="p3">Julie.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about how this visit came together?\xc2\xa0 Did the President invite her?\xc2\xa0 Or how it came to fruition and sort of what was the impetus for that?\xc2\xa0 And then also, separately, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware there\xe2\x80\x99s a hearing on the Hill today where the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to Ebola has come under some fair degree of criticism.\xc2\xa0 So can you tell us what Ron Klain has been doing and will be doing in the days to come to sort of get that into a better place and respond to some of the criticism that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting that the response has been inadequate?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s first talk about the visit of Nina Pham today.\xc2\xa0 The White House learned early today that she was going to be released from the National Institutes of Health medical facility that had been treating her for the last week or so.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the NIH is just a few miles from the White House. And White House officials contacted the NIH to let her know that the President was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it. We were certainly pleased to see that she accepted the invitation and all look forward to her arrival here at the White House shortly.</p>\n<p class="p2">As it relates to the hearing today, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see much of it. It does seem that most of the criticism was registered by somebody who struggled to pronounce the name of the virus at the hearing, so I think we might not be too concerned about some of the partisan criticism that was on display I think in the hearing.\xc2\xa0 But there was representation from the administration at the hearing.\xc2\xa0 It does reflect our commitment to working with Congress to ensure that the country is working together and pulling in the same direction to respond to this situation, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that in the days ahead.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s Ron Klain doing?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us anything about how he\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending his time?\xc2\xa0 I know he is supposed to go to Atlanta, to the CDC next week.\xc2\xa0 What else is he doing?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Today is his third day on the job, so I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased that there has been a lot of interest in the work that he is doing here.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has been convening meetings and regularly working closely with officials at the CDC and HHS as they put in place some of the protocols that have been announced over the course of this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">He also was in touch with New York officials last night and over the course of today to ensure that the state and local officials were feeling the kind of support that they\xe2\x80\x99re receiving from the Obama administration as they deal with this latest Ebola case.\xc2\xa0 He is planning to travel to Atlanta next week, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to meet in person with some of the CDC officials that he has been on the phone with a lot over the course of the last few days.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you give us some details on the SWAT team that was sent to New York last night -- how many people, what exactly they\xe2\x80\x99re doing?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific details about the members of the SWAT team.\xc2\xa0 I know as a general matter, when they are -- members of the SWAT team who are assembled are individuals who typically have an expertise in the area of infection control in hospitals.\xc2\xa0 It typically will include individuals who have dealt with Ebola patients in the past.\xc2\xa0 There has also been talk about the importance of individuals who can be closely monitoring health care workers as they\xe2\x80\x99re donning and doffing personal protection equipment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">There also has been the designation in these circumstances of a site manager, somebody who can be in charge of ensuring that the protocols are very closely followed. Those are the kinds of people that are typically part of a SWAT team.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to CDC about how many individuals and which individuals fit the profile that I just described.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I can give you a little bit more color on one other aspect of this, which is that there was -- in order to quickly transport the team from the CDC to New York, the President ordered that a Department of Defense aircraft be commissioned to fly them from Atlanta to New York so they could be in place as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 I do understand that weather briefly delayed their arrival because there was a pretty bad storm in New York last night.\xc2\xa0 But it is because we were able to draw on some DOD resources and because this team was prepared, that they were on the ground within hours, just a couple hours of this individual being -- testing positive for Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And I think that indicates the kind of commitment that CDC has to taking very seriously the responsibilities of acting quickly to support local health care professionals when they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with an Ebola patient.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how soon after news of the confirmation that that individual in New York had Ebola did the President make that order?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact tick-tock of all of this.\xc2\xa0 I know that there was a -- because of his travel history and because of his close contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, there was a strong suspicion that he would test positive for Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So I think that some of the wheels were put into motion a little earlier than they otherwise would have been because of the specifics of this individual case.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to comment on the specific plans, whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99re considering quarantine -- forcing a quarantine here in the United States or before folks travel.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter, does news of the fact that we have another case of Ebola, this time in New York, indicate that something more needs to be done, that more steps need to be put in place?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the answer to that is, not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 Because we continue to believe that the risk facing New Yorkers from the Ebola virus today continues to be exceedingly low.\xc2\xa0 There are a small number of individuals who did have close contact with Dr. Spencer upon his return from West Africa who have been isolated.\xc2\xa0 But for the average New Yorker who is riding the subway today or taking a stroll along the High Line, presuming the weather there is better than it was yesterday, those individuals do not face a significantly elevated risk in this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And the reason is -- and this is important -- the reason is that Dr. Spencer was very closely monitoring his own health.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as he noticed that he might be displaying symptoms that are consistent with Ebola, he contacted health care professional who are trained and prepared to respond quickly, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they did.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any qualms about riding the subway today in New York, or going bowling at the bowling alley, or hitching a ride with Uber?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is a big fan of bowling.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not the best bowler, but --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He is an accomplished bowler.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I think we may need a fact-check on that.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been practicing.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President would have no qualms about riding the subway in New York or taking a stroll on the High Line, which is, I know, something that he would love to do -- or even bowling a few frames at this bowling alley in Brooklyn.</p>\n<p class="p3">The risk that is facing the average New Yorker, the average person going to those places remains today exceedingly low.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you just, just one more time -- this is quite an extraordinary event that Nina Pham has just been released, just been cleared of Ebola, and then she\xe2\x80\x99s coming right here to the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 What is the significance, the symbolic significance of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today with Nina Pham?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is an opportunity for the President to, first of all, to thank her for her service. \xc2\xa0Again, this is an individual -- this is a nurse who used her training to treat somebody who was really sick with Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And she dove into treating this individual without regard for her own health.\xc2\xa0 This is somebody who -- she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a raise because she did it.\xc2\xa0 She certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for the glory.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of individuals who treated that first Ebola patient in Dallas who we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about.\xc2\xa0 So this is somebody who displayed the kind of selfless service to her fellow man that I think is worthy of some praise. At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re also certainly relieved that she has been successfully treated and has recovered from Ebola.\xc2\xa0 I think that reflects, as I mentioned earlier, that the prayers of countless of Americans have been answered today.</p>\n<p class="p3">So we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly celebrating alongside her.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to meeting her.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just to follow up lastly on what Olivier was asking about.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is an important meeting.\xc2\xa0 Why ban reporters from this meeting?\xc2\xa0 Why ban video cameras?\xc2\xa0 I mean, countless other events in the Oval Office under this President and other Presidents, there are reporters present, there are television cameras present.\xc2\xa0 Why does this White House decide on a meeting this important to say, no, reporters are not allowed at this event?\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The good news is that reporters will be allowed at the event.\xc2\xa0 The photo -- your colleagues, the photojournalists will be in there to take a photograph of the President greeting her.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 There are no print reporters allowed.\xc2\xa0 There are no television reporters allowed.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no editorial presence.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re only allowing still photographers.\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Many of you did have the opportunity to see her deliver remarks at the NIH upon her departure from the hospital.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not an answer to my question.\xc2\xa0 Why was this decision made?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because reporters did have the opportunity to see her speak already.\xc2\xa0 And this is an opportunity for the President to greet her at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And we did want to make sure that photographers could see her do so, but the President, nor Ms. Pham plans to make any comments today.</p>\n<p class="p3">Laura.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, just to follow up on what Olivier and this gentleman is saying, if you had a foreign camera, this is a worldwide story.\xc2\xa0 This is a huge symbol for all of us.\xc2\xa0 I mean, American press or foreign press, to see the President welcoming here this nurse.\xc2\xa0 Yes, why, is the first question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly good news, and I do understand that there will be wire photographers that will be in the Oval Office taking this picture and that image will be beamed around the world.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a video thing.\xc2\xa0 I mean, for people in Africa at this moment, it would be quite important to see this footage of the President welcoming this woman.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And the good news is that they will see a photograph of the President greeting this woman in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 So it will be a really nice event I think.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question is, was the President briefed on the attack in New York against the police officers yesterday?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President was informed of the situation by Lisa Monaco last night.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a situation that is under investigation by the New York Police Department, local law enforcement authorities.\xc2\xa0 Officials here at the White House and other federal law enforcement officials have been in touch with local law enforcement on this matter, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still under investigation so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have too much to say about it at this point.</p>\n<p class="p2">Ed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to go back to Ebola.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said several times Dr. Spencer was monitoring himself very closely.\xc2\xa0 Why was a doctor who just came from treating Ebola patients in West Africa allowed to monitor himself as opposed to having the government keep a closer eye on whether or not he was getting sick?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He is a highly trained medical professional, certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.\xc2\xa0 He had been advised by the government that --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, and he still got Ebola, obviously.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He had been advised by the government about what steps he should take should he notice that symptoms like a high fever, or at least an elevated fever, were evident.\xc2\xa0 And he followed those steps.\xc2\xa0 And because of the preparation of state and local officials in New York, he is receiving treatment already.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has told the public again and again we don\xe2\x80\x99t need a travel ban because we have these very tough restrictions in place, which include taking people\xe2\x80\x99s temperatures when they come in.\xc2\xa0 And so we did that, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a temperature at that point.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest there is a gap there in the system?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is not a gap in the system, Ed.\xc2\xa0 And it goes back to the fact that the only way that an individual can contract the Ebola virus is by coming into close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who is already displaying symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t catch Ebola through the air.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t catch Ebola by drinking food -- or drinking water or eating the food in the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 You said that earlier.\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to raise a question about the people on the plane -- you made that point earlier.\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m saying there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who was interacting with people who had Ebola in West Africa, so we knew he was high-risk for this.\xc2\xa0 He did heroic work trying to help those people.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he was not high-risk for this, Ed.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that there --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how did he get it?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor treating Ebola patients.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there are dozens of health care workers who have treated Ebola patients in West Africa and did that without contracting the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 He is at an --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A higher risk than you or I.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- an elevated risk, but not a high risk.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand the difference.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he stopped from coming to America until we know for sure he does not have Ebola since he was interacting with people and treating people who had Ebola?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, he was somebody who was screened before he returned to the United States.\xc2\xa0 He was screened in West Africa before he boarded an aircraft and he was screened upon arrival in the United States.\xc2\xa0 In both indications -- or in both situations, he did not exhibit any symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 That means that he was not at all contagious.\xc2\xa0 So anybody who was flying on the plane, anybody who happened to be in the airport at the same time that he was there does not face --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He got it later.\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying but then he still got Ebola later and went out -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he infected anyone else.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully he did not.\xc2\xa0 But the point is he got through there because he was not showing symptoms.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest that you can\xe2\x80\x99t catch everyone on their way in because they might not be showing symptoms?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But what it shows is it shows that people can\xe2\x80\x99t catch Ebola unless they come into the close contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who is already displaying symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And because he -- shortly after he started displaying symptoms of Ebola, he contacted public health officials who safely transported him to a hospital where he was isolated and where he was being -- where he started treatment.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication that the American people and the people of New York City do not face a significant risk from this situation.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I want to go on to another subject.\xc2\xa0 The conservative group, Judicial Watch, has just put out a statement yesterday, I believe, saying when the President, months ago, evoked executive privilege on Fast and Furious, it included 20 emails between the Attorney General, his wife and his mother.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering, did the Attorney General talk about this sensitive gunrunning operation with his wife and his mother and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have to invoke executive privilege?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice about this.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Justice privilege; it was executive privilege.\xc2\xa0 It was invoked by the President, not the Attorney General.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Department of Justice that can discuss those emails with you.\xc2\xa0 What is clear is that this lawsuit that has been filed by Judicial Watch actually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with the actual Fast and Furious operation.\xc2\xa0 It has to do with emails and documents related to the operation.\xc2\xa0 More than 7,500 pages of those documents have already been turned over to Congress, which has obviously thoroughly reviewed this situation and they\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted countless interviews.\xc2\xa0 The Inspector General has as well.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has been thoroughly investigated.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if there was nothing sensitive in the emails that the Attorney General sent to his wife and mom, presumably they could have been turned over.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that, again, 7,500 pages of documents were turned over both to the Inspector General as well as to Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are investigating this issue.\xc2\xa0 So we have demonstrated I think a pretty clear commitment to a legitimate oversight on this matter and others. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last one, on ISIS.\xc2\xa0 There were reports that the administration is investigating allegations that there have been chlorine attacks by ISIS on the ground in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whether that\'s been in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Was it also in Syria?\xc2\xa0 And how concerned are you that these terrorists are also using chemical weapons?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, we\'ve seen those reports and we\'re continuing to investigate them.\xc2\xa0 We, obviously, as we have in the past, take seriously allegations of chemical weapons use, and so we\'ll have staff on the ground and other places analyze what exactly happened and try to get to the bottom of these reports.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not in a position to confirm them at this point.</p>\n<p class="p3">Kristen.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just to follow up, if they are true, how would it change the equation in Iraq?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re going to investigate those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen them, but I don\'t have any comment beyond saying we\'re looking into them.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it potentially change the U.S. strategy?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to review those reports before we draw any conclusions.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And during the hearing today, several doctors said to Congressman Issa when he asked if there\xe2\x80\x99s a larger overall failure when it comes to being prepared to fight infectious disease, several doctors said yes.\xc2\xa0 So my question is are there steps being taken beyond Ebola to tighten the system to make sure the U.S. is prepared for these types of eventualities?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there obviously have been a lot of steps that have been taken already to ensure that we are doing everything we can to protect the American public.\xc2\xa0 And there has been a significant commitment by this administration even before this latest Ebola outbreak in West Africa to ensure that we\'re taking the necessary steps here in the U.S. but also around the world to try to protect the American people from diseases like this.</p>\n<p class="p3">What we are typically concerned about are situations that exist in countries like those in West Africa that don\'t have a modern medical infrastructure, and the ability of an outbreak of a contagious virus is something that we\'ve been focused on for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 I know this was actually the focus of attention in the previous administration as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">I\'ll tell you that as recently as September, the United States convened a major global event to garner international commitment and resources for the global health security agenda.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that has drawn the attention of the Obama administration and medical professionals here in this country even before the headlines were filled with reports of Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, does the administration disagree with what those doctors were saying?\xc2\xa0 Do you have confidence right now --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the specific testimony of those individuals.\xc2\xa0 But what I can confirm for you, and what is evident from anybody who takes a close look at the track record here is that the United States, under the leadership of this President, has been focused on ensuring we\'re doing what we can to protect the American public from diseases that may break out anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to take one more try at this question that I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a number of different ways, but Congressman Jason Chaffetz said today, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\'t have someone who\xe2\x80\x99s had direct contact with Ebola patients and allow them to go bowling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p class="p2">Isn\'t there -- do you agree that on some level there is a problem with that, that that exposes a gap in the system?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the problem it\'s exposed may be related to Mr. Chaffetz\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of actually how Ebola is transmitted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was treating Ebola patients, though.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He was.\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like I should go through this again.\xc2\xa0 The only way that you can contract Ebola is by coming into the close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who is displaying symptoms of Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand what you\'re saying, Josh.\xc2\xa0 But now there are two other people who were quarantined because this individual -- and again, this is not to place the blame on him at all, but because this individual was obviously exposed to the disease and then came back here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try to answer this a slightly different way, which is to present an illustration.\xc2\xa0 There are only two known instances in which the Ebola virus has been transmitted inside the United States, and those were to two health care workers in Dallas who were treating a patient who was very sick with Ebola.\xc2\xa0 These are ostensibly individuals who, because of their commitment to serving this individual and because of their commitment to their profession, probably came into close contact with the bodily fluids of this individual who was very sick with Ebola.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">The exact details or the exact circumstances that were in place that allowed them to contract the disease is still under investigation, but we know why they were at a higher risk.\xc2\xa0 I think what people should understand is the people who are in Mr. Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s family and living with him even after he was sick with Ebola recently were cleared from monitoring because it had been more than 21 days since they had last been in contact with him.</p>\n<p class="p2">So that is an indication of the circumstances under which someone can contract Ebola.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that Dr. Spencer is somebody who was closely monitoring his health and at the first indication that he might have the symptoms of Ebola, therefore at the first indication that he might at all be even the slightest bit contagious with Ebola, he contacted health care professionals who responded quickly to his residence, and they transported him under existing, strengthened protocols to the hospital that was prepared to receive him.\xc2\xa0 They quickly isolated him and began giving him treatment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So, again, I\'m not sure if there are people who, for whatever reason, think that it might be in their interest one way or another to try to agitate or provoke anxiety among the American people, but I would strongly encourage anybody who is concerned about this situation to focus on the facts and to focus on exactly what we know about how this virus is transmitted, about how limited the circumstances have been where individuals have contracted Ebola in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">It\'s also important for people to understand that there are circumstances where people did appear to be at an elevated risk of contracting Ebola but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that is a useful illustration that people should keep in mind if they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about how this disease is transmitted.\xc2\xa0 And I guess that\'s advice I wouldn\'t just share to average Americans, I\'d even share it with politicians on Capitol Hill as well.</p>\n<p class="p2">Mr. Plante.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said a moment ago that the reason the President wanted to see Nurse Pham was to thank her for her service.\xc2\xa0 That being the case, wouldn\'t you want to have him do that in front of a television camera so that the rest of the country could see it?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think in this case, in order to offer his gratitude the President wanted to do that in person with Ms. Pham, and that\'s what he\'ll do in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Was there a White House TV camera in that meeting?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 The meeting has taken place since I walked out here, so I don\'t know.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there was, would you then put that on the net?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If you\'re interested in it, we can work with you to get that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, we\'re interested in knowing why, if you do, you\xe2\x80\x99d make it available, bypassing us.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We can engage in this hypothetical discussion after the briefing and after I\'ve determined whether or not there was a television camera in there.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about the nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report that the White House is pushing a particular deal with Iran with the rest of the P5-plus-1 in order to get something done by the deadline of the end of next month.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell me about that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, discussions continue to be underway between the -- I guess among the members of the P5-plus-1 and Iranian representatives about steps that can be taken to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are we pushing a particular solution -- we, the U.S.?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, generally speaking, we\xe2\x80\x99re pushing a solution that would allow the international community to have clear insight into Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ability to resolve everybody\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the details of that agreement, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that from here.\xc2\xa0 This is something that obviously is being discussed in a very detailed fashion by the United States and our P5-plus-1 partners and the representatives of Iran.</p>\n<p class="p2">Justin.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting this afternoon on ISIS over at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I guess my first question is why he\xe2\x80\x99s going to the State Department, especially since he\xe2\x80\x99s -- according to the guidance you guys have given us, he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with his National Security Council, which he routinely meets with here.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He typically does meet with them here.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just a week or two ago the President convened a National Security Council meeting at the Pentagon to discuss these issues.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon obviously has a very important role in our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The State Department also has an important role in terms of working through our diplomatic channels to build this broad international coalition in support of this broader effort.</p>\n<p class="p2">So the President is going to convene the meeting there.\xc2\xa0 I think the meeting will sort of run the gamut of all of the elements of the strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s been put in place, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout of that meeting when it concludes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate him giving diplomats there guidance on this meeting that\xe2\x80\x99s coming up in Kuwait on kind of combating extremism -- extremists -- extremism and sort of Internet recruitment, especially in light of what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific meeting in Kuwait that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 But there are a lot of elements to our strategy.\xc2\xa0 Certainly stopping the flow of foreign fighters is an important part of that strategy.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda for this meeting, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get you a readout afterwards, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s discussed we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to let you know.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, one last thing on a totally different topic. Politico had a story yesterday that said Denis McDonough was asking top staff members to say whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99d stay through the remainder of the President\xe2\x80\x99s term after the midterms. I was wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s true, if that\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation you\xe2\x80\x99ve had with him or that you\xe2\x80\x99re aware that other staff members have had with him.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a conversation that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had with him.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to all the conversations that senior staffers have had with the Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any regimented schedule of conversations that the Chief of Staff is planning to have.</p>\n<p class="p2">Steven.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there were reports today in Israel and now here in the U.S., as well, that the administration rejected the suggestion or the ask of a meeting between the Israeli Defense Minister and the Vice President and the Secretary of State, that it was punitive.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on these reports?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I do understand that the Israeli Defense Minister met with his American counterpart, our Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to any of the meetings that -- so I can speak to the meeting that did occur, and I understand the Department of Defense put out a readout of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to any meetings that didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if it\xe2\x80\x99s true that the U.S. and the White House rejected the ask for these meetings with the Vice President and the National Security Advisor?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much information to share with you about meetings that did not occur.\xc2\xa0 I do know that there was a meeting that occurred between Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and his Israeli counterpart.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">As you know, the United States values the strong security relationship that we have with Israel.\xc2\xa0 It is arguably as strong with Israel as anybody else.\xc2\xa0 And so those kinds of meetings between the Israeli Secretary of Defense and his American counterpart are obviously an important priority; they take place pretty frequently.\xc2\xa0 But you can contact the Department of Defense for a readout of that meeting.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just be a contrarian for one moment about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Nurse Pham.\xc2\xa0 Is it a good idea for the President to meet with Nurse Pham given the fact that she just got out of a specialized hospital being treated for Ebola?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who has tested negative five times for the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 Her doctors, who are some of the foremost experts in the field, have confirmed that she is virus free.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No risk to the President whatsoever?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, I think the only question that people had was whether or not she would be up for making the trip down here to the White House.\xc2\xa0 And we were pleased to see on television that she looked very healthy when she was delivering her statement, and pleased that she accepted the invitation of the President.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And according to the print photographers who went inside the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Nurse Pham, the President did hug Nurse Pham.\xc2\xa0 And is that -- should he maybe just hold off on that a little bit just to be cautious?\xc2\xa0 He is the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he is the President, and he was not at all concerned about any risk that would be associated with him showing his gratitude to her by hugging her.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to Dr. Spencer, his case, does it not present a sort of an interesting discussion about personal responsibility?\xc2\xa0 Because he came back, he was taking his temperature, he was monitoring his own health conditions and so forth.\xc2\xa0 But I mean, I think it could be argued that not every doctor would be as diligent coming back from West Africa, and perhaps some doctors might take more risks than others.\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you sort of leaving it up to the personal responsibility of each and every health care worker who comes back from West Africa to do the right thing, to make sure that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have exposures like what could have happened in New York and may potentially still happen?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just posit, Jim, that individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease.\xc2\xa0 And I think that they would take seriously their responsibility to ensure that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t responsible for transmitting it to others intentionally.\xc2\xa0 And so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all surprising that somebody like Dr. Spencer, who was so dedicated to stopping the spread of this disease, that he\xe2\x80\x99d be monitoring his own health very closely, which apparently he was.</p>\n<p class="p3">It\xe2\x80\x99s also not at all surprising that somebody was so steeped in the details of the treatment of this disease, that he would respond the appropriate way once it became clear that he was experiencing an elevated body temperature and he did contact the medical professionals in New York who were trained and ready to deal with this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 And we were pleased that he was transported so quickly to the hospital and isolated and began receiving treatment quite early.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion about whether or not an Ebola vaccine has been developed quickly enough. \xc2\xa0And I know Dr. Fauci talked about that earlier today down at the NIH.\xc2\xa0 Has the President mentioned it at all as a priority to the people meeting in these Ebola gatherings that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had here at the White House?\xc2\xa0 Is Ron Klain prodding the scientists who are developing this vaccine to get things moving?\xc2\xa0 Is the President prodding people to get this moving?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, a lot of these kinds of decisions are driven by science, and there obviously is a sense of urgency associated with dealing with this Ebola outbreak in West Africa. And again, the only way that we can entirely eliminate the risk to the American people from the Ebola virus is to stop this outbreak at the source, and certainly a vaccine could play a key role in doing exactly that.</p>\n<p class="p3">As a general matter, I can tell you that the President has, on countless occasions, spoken about the value of medical research in this country, both the value in terms of enhancing the safety of the American people, but also the value in strengthening our economy; that this kind of research often leads to important innovations that can be very good for our economy, can lead to elements of job creation.\xc2\xa0 And we have been disappointed that some Republicans in Congress haven\xe2\x80\x99t shared the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to this kind of issue that would be good for the American people, but also good for our economy.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how does our current system protect us from a psychopath coming from Africa who would want to do us harm, who would want to infect people?\xc2\xa0 Because it sounds like somebody who is infected could pass through into the United States and then develop a fever later.\xc2\xa0 How do we stop those people?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we stop them in a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 One is, we certainly do have in place screening measures at the airport both in West Africa and in the United States to ensure that individuals who\xe2\x80\x99ve recently traveled in West Africa do not have symptoms of Ebola.</p>\n<p class="p3">You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just earlier this week, the CDC announced a regimen for the active monitoring of all travelers who have recently been in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 What the CDC will do is they will share information with state and local public health authorities so that those authorities have the information that they need to monitor the health of those individuals who have recently traveled to West Africa.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly would account for what I think is probably even the far-fetched hypothetical scenario that you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out.</p>\n<p class="p2">Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 After the U.S. Supreme Court last struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, the administration worked to extend the federal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples to a great extent throughout the country, regardless of the state in which these couples lived.\xc2\xa0 The exception to that is Social Security and veterans benefits, the Justice Department showing that it could not grant those benefits to couples living in non-marriage-equality states.\xc2\xa0 But now there are some LGBT advocates who say that those benefits can be extended and there\xe2\x80\x99s been multiple lawsuits, including one filed this week to compel the administration to do so.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Dianne Feinstein, herself wrote a letter to the President saying that those benefits should be extended. \xc2\xa0Is there any consideration at the White House to making a policy change to extend those Social Security and veterans benefits?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have to admit, Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99m not steeped in the details of this particular case or particularly as it relates to this lawsuit, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice that may be able to share some more information for you on that.</p>\n<p class="p2">So let\xe2\x80\x99s do the week ahead.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Monday, the President will meet with the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership Steering Committee at the White House.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Tuesday, the President will travel to --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What committee is that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership Steering Committee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details -- this is a steering committee that\xe2\x80\x99s interested in partnering on issues related to advanced manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the guidance.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Please tip your waitresses on the way out.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Tuesday, the President will travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to attend a DNC roundtable and a campaign event for Mary Burke and other Wisconsin Democrats.\xc2\xa0 As you may know, Ms. Burke is running for governor in the state of Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 Further details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Wisconsin will be made available over the weekend.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Wednesday, the President will be here at the White House and will attend some meetings.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Thursday, the President will travel to beautiful Portland, Maine to attend a DNC roundtable and a campaign event for Mike Michaud and other Maine Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Michaud, as you guys all know, is a Democratic congressman from Maine who is running for governor there.\xc2\xa0 Additional details about the trip to Maine will be available soon.\xc2\xa0 After those activities in Maine, the President will travel to Providence, Rhode Island, where he will remain overnight.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Friday, the President will wake up in Providence, Rhode Island, and deliver remarks at Rhode Island College.\xc2\xa0 His remarks will focus on the economy and the importance of pursuing policies that help women succeed.\xc2\xa0 Additional details about the Rhode Island trip will be available in the coming days as well.</p>\n<p class="p2">The President will return to the White House on Friday after that event.\xc2\xa0 And then in the evening, the President and the First Lady will welcome local children and children of military families to a trick-or-treat on the South Portico of the White House.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s something that a lot of people are looking forward to.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Saturday -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some additional details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities next weekend.\xc2\xa0 So this is next Saturday, the President will travel to Detroit, Michigan -- or the Detroit, Michigan area to attend a campaign event for Gary Peters and Mark Schuauer.\xc2\xa0 Additional details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Michigan will be available soon.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Mr. Peters is a candidate for the Senate and Mr. Schauer a candidate for governor in Michigan.</p>\n<p class="p2">On Sunday, the President will travel to Bridgeport, Connecticut for an event with Dan Malloy and other Connecticut Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Malloy is the sitting governor of Connecticut and he is running for reelection.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that this was a trip that was originally scheduled for last week, but was rescheduled for next weekend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">After that event in Connecticut, the President will travel to Philadelphia to attend a campaign event for Tom Wolf and other Pennsylvania Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Wolf is, of course, the Democratic candidate for governor in Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have additional details about next Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Connecticut and Pennsylvania available soon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rhode Island then is also a make-up?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, this is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a good point, Scott.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s event in Rhode Island on Friday is rescheduled from the event that had to be canceled last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the most he has been campaigning since the reelect, I guess.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably a fair assessment.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a pretty good one.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he pretty psyched up about it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Psyched I think is actually the word the President used.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to it next week and hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll all be able to join us as we travel.</p>\n<p class="p2">Have a good weekend, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
