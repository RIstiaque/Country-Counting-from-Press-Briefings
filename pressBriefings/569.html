Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:12 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here on Friday, rainy Friday.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement at the top.\xc2\xa0 I do have a week ahead, which if you remind me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver at the end.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, on the effort on renewal of the jobless benefits, Senator Reid offered a proposal that would pay for an extension through November, but since he alienated potential Republican supporters by not allowing any Republican amendments, why would the President agree to that kind of strategy given the urgency that you said at the podium is required to get this done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s review what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 We need to renew these benefits right away.\xc2\xa0 There are 1.3 million Americans out there, and their families, who are wondering if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get assistance.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve already missed one payment, and they\xe2\x80\x99re on track now to miss another.\xc2\xa0 We have said that the temporary short-term extension, three months, without offsets that is moving in the Senate and cleared one hurdle ought to be passed so that assistance can be provided right away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Republicans have said they want offsets.\xc2\xa0 They want offsets.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to talk about -- have conversations about how to move forward on a long-term extension.\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid and Senate Democrats, in response to Republicans, as I understand it, and their insistence on offsets put forward a proposal for a long-term extension using offsets that Republicans support.\xc2\xa0 And now that\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe.\xc2\xa0 What do you tell those families?\xc2\xa0 You got what you wanted but you still won\xe2\x80\x99t extend the benefits?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is a legislative strategy issue.\xc2\xa0 Why not allow --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Jim, I understand that parliamentary procedures can be complex, but what Republicans first said in December is we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t extend benefits, right?\xc2\xa0 Then, Senator Heller and progressively a handful of other Republican senators said that we should, and they allowed cloture and many of them have said that we need to have pay-fors, offsets.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Reid, as I understand it, came back and said, okay, for a long-term extension we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, and here are the offsets.\xc2\xa0 And these are offsets that Republicans have said they support and have supported in the past, including one that Chairman Ryan included in the budget deal with Senator Murray.</p>\n<p>So what now?\xc2\xa0 What are you asking these families to do now in exchange for the lifeline that Congress needs to provide to them?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House talking to any of the Republican senators yesterday on this issue or simply with Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Broadly, on the issue, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged with members of both parties on it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press Congress to move forward.\xc2\xa0 It would be best, in our view, if they would just pass the short-term extension, and then we could have discussions about a longer-term extension.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s striking to me that if Senator Reid had put forward a proposal that reflects the concerns that Republicans said they had and does what they said they wanted, and then there\'s a problem, that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate -- because we really need to do this, and we need to get these benefits into the mailboxes of these families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on Iran -- latest vote count in the Senate is 59 senators supporting some kind of Iran sanctions measure, and they\'re moving toward even a potentially veto-proof number.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House worried about that number?\xc2\xa0 And does it add extra pressure on this next round that\xe2\x80\x99s unfolding in Geneva to actually show some progress so that you can make your case on the Hill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, our position remains what it\'s been, which is that, first, Congress has been a strong partner with this administration in passing and implementing and enforcing the most effective sanctions regime in history, and one that claims that status because of the strategy the President has employed from the time he took office, which allowed for consensus internationally so that the sanctions regime is not just an American sanctions regime, but an international one, which is what makes it so effective.</p>\n<p>The purpose of that sanctions regime, the purpose of responding to Iranian intransigence with these series of sanctions and this structure was to try to change Iranian behavior so that Iran would come to the table and begin to talk seriously about how to get right with its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions regime that was put in place with the excellent assistance of Congress and our international partners has had that effect.\xc2\xa0 It has brought Iran to the table, and resulted in a change in the calculations of the Iranian leadership to the extent that they made agreement on the preliminary six-month agreement, and that sort of technical talks continue there as they move towards implementation.\xc2\xa0 And then we will look at whether or not further negotiations can produce a concrete, permanent and verifiable resolution to this challenge that will allow us to be sure that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon, and we can do that peacefully.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is the goal.\xc2\xa0 That was the purpose of sanctions, and that\'s why we are where we are.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have in our many discussions with members of Congress urged them not to pass further sanctions legislation now because it would be counterproductive.\xc2\xa0 It would I think in many ways have the opposite effect that they hope it would have because it could, if they were to do it, actually weaken the sanctions structure that\'s in place by undermining faith among our international partners and providing Iran the opportunity to say that we have been negotiating in bad faith.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think we all -- at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue -- share the same goal, which is to deprive Iran of a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That is the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, and we have worked together towards that policy, and we want to continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 And Congress has the capacity -- should Iran fail to meet its obligations in either the interim agreement or fail to come to an agreement with the international community, the P5-plus-1 in the final analysis -- to act very swiftly to impose further sanctions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if they were to do that then, if it were necessary, they would again have, we believe, the kind of consensus internationally behind that action that would allow it to be enforced and to result in the consequences for Iran that they seek.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s our view.</p>\n<p>We continue to consult with members of Congress, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that we oppose this legislation strongly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this increase pressure on having some kind of concrete result in the short term to forestall action in the Senate, to have --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- when you say concrete result in the short term, there is -- you may have seen recently that EU Deputy Secretary General Schmid and Deputy Foreign Minister Araqchi made very good progress on all the pertinent issues in the ongoing process, and I believe they\'re taking back to capitals, so capitals are looking at what\xe2\x80\x99s been achieved in Geneva, and we hope to finalize the implementation agreement soon, which is the first-stage agreement.\xc2\xa0 So that is progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there is no question that a longer, more -- I mean, a more permanent resolution to this challenge, a verifiable commitment by Iran to forsake a nuclear weapon will require further extensive negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of this implementation agreement is to stop Iran from making progress on its program, roll back aspects of it while these longer-term negotiations take place.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a positive thing.\xc2\xa0 Because the alternative would be to -- if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the interim agreement -- would be to allow Iran to continue to make to progress, even speed up progress on all aspects of its program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, along those lines, Iran and Russia are negotiating an oil-for-goods swap worth $1.5 billion a month that would let Iran lift oil exports.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern this would undermine the sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that report and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I may also refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 We have worked very closely with the P5-plus-1 and all of our partners in building a sanctions regime, part of which addresses aggressively Iranian oil exports.\xc2\xa0 That regime has been effective in bringing about the opportunity that the P5-plus-1 and the world has now.\xc2\xa0 So on the specific matter that you have mentioned, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question and also refer you to State.\xc2\xa0 If we have more here to say about it I can get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on health care, there is a report the administration is replacing its main contractor, CGI, with another one.\xc2\xa0 Is this true?\xc2\xa0 And if so, does this create some disruption as you post the final deadline?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that report.\xc2\xa0 Contracts at CMS are something that CMS would address.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information on that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a tweet from one of our colleagues here in the White House Press Corps, Julianna Goldman with Bloomberg, saying that the President will announce --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Troublemaker.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- his changes at the NSA on Friday, January 17th.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that count as confirmation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it does.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You can expect the President to speak about these issues on Friday, January 17th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know that the President has been having these meetings with stakeholders --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There goes your week ahead.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has been holding these meetings with stakeholders on NSA surveillance activities, and I was just curious -- I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what the President is going to announce and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tip anybody\xe2\x80\x99s hand as to what reforms he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at and what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to propose, but looking ahead a year from now, will Americans feel that their civil liberties are better protected by these reforms that the President is going to pursue?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that they will see an NSA that has dramatically curtailed its surveillance activities, marginally curtailed?\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hazard to address the second part of that question, because the President has been clear throughout this review process that we will not harm our national security or our ability to face global threats.\xc2\xa0 And our intelligence-gathering activities are directly related to our ability to face those global threats and protect our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to the broader question, the goal the President I think has set here is to take measures that create more transparency, introduce reforms that improve the system in a way that gives the American people more confidence.\xc2\xa0 As for what kinds of measures he\'s considering, I won\'t get into that; I\'ll let the President speak to it.\xc2\xa0 But we have been very clear about the kinds of recommendations he has been getting.\xc2\xa0 The review group\'s report was publicly released for that reason.\xc2\xa0 So we made clear upon the release of that report that the President considered all of the recommendations worth serious consideration, and that\'s what he and his team is giving them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any idea about the format of the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The scheduling matter, you want to -- no, I don\'t have any more detail.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it will be a speech?\xc2\xa0 It will be here somewhere?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you that he will be making remarks to discuss the outcomes of the work that\'s been done and the review process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In what?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ann, I don\'t have anything more than the confirmation of the intrepid reporting that produced the news flash that it will happen on January 17th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, any response to House Speaker John Boehner\'s tweet that was within minutes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of tweets.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- within minutes after the jobs report came out this morning -- "Where are the jobs?"\xc2\xa0 Where are the jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you saw our statement in reaction to the monthly jobs report.\xc2\xa0 The Chairman of the CEA Jason Furman has been out, as has the Secretary of Labor.\xc2\xa0 And our view has always been -- whether it is a month where job creation exceeds expectations or is a month where it comes in below expectations -- that we have continued to see progress in the economy, but we have more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And we need to get that unemployment insurance to those families who need it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One of the things I think that the underlying data show is that long-term unemployment in the starkest possible way remains the biggest problem we face when it comes to unemployment.\xc2\xa0 I\'m risking saying more than I understand, because I\'m not an economist.\xc2\xa0 But an economist told me this morning that -- (laughter) -- I\'m going to try to put it in layman\'s terms, that the short-term employment rate is now roughly at where it was during the last expansion and maybe a little below it, which means that the unemployment problem we have is truly concentrated in the long-term unemployment part of it.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s something the President has talked about a lot.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that is very much at the heart of the debate about how to move forward on extending unemployment insurance benefits, because we\'re talking about here people who have been unemployed and are looking for a job and have been doing so for a long time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me move.\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on India.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House response to what\'s going on with this latest permutation in the ongoing issue between diplomats with the removal of this U.S. diplomat in the New Delhi embassy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, Jessica, is that the White House is of course aware of this matter, which is being handled by the State Department and the Department of Justice, so I will have to refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Further, as I\'ve said over the course of our conversations about this, the United States and India enjoy a broad and deep friendship.\xc2\xa0 And this isolated episode is not indicative of the close and mutually respectful ties that we share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For matters related to U.S. diplomats and this general issue, I think the State Department is the best place to go; on the case itself, the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask on Syria?\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm the reports that the U.S. is considering returning nonlethal aid to the rebels, or parts of the rebels?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that, as we said when we made the decision to suspend nonlethal assistance to the Supreme Military Council, this has nothing to do with our support for the moderate military opposition but rather the security of our assistance.\xc2\xa0 And in that context, we have been reviewing if we can resume the aid to the SMC as we continue to want to support the moderate armed opposition.\xc2\xa0 We are currently reviewing how to do this moving forward, but no decisions have been made yet regarding the resumption of nonlethal assistance to the SMC.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have resumed deliveries of nonlethal assistance into\xc2\xa0 northern Syria to civilian actors -- so not the armed opposition, but the civilian actors.\xc2\xa0 And as we have made clear, our humanitarian assistance has continued throughout with no suspensions.\xc2\xa0 And I know it\'s sort of complicated groups here, but the humanitarian assistance is assistance delivered sort of blind to any Syrian who needs it; the nonlethal assistance is delivered to specific recipients, and that includes both the nonlethal assistance that has been suspended as we review the security of it to the SMC, but the nonlethal assistance to civilian actors has been reinstated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How are you vetting people who are getting it, given the fact that the people are starting to change sides now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a question I think best addressed to the agencies that deliver the aid.\xc2\xa0 But vetting is obviously something that has been a priority across the board when it comes to our policy of supporting the Syrian opposition and providing assistance to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, the suspension -- I think it\'s important when you ask that question, that the suspension of aid to the SMC was not a vetting matter, it was a matter of the security of the aid after the incident at a warehouse.\xc2\xa0 We still do strongly support and want to be able to continue to provide nonlethal assistance to the SMC, to the moderate armed opposition, and are reviewing ways that we can restore that aid.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an endpoint for that review, or a time certain?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of one, but perhaps the State Department can give you more information.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the jobs numbers, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I seem to remember you at the podium not long ago showing us charts of jobs growth over the past couple of years, and the implication taking some credit -- the White House taking credit for the President\'s policies in contributing to jobs growth.\xc2\xa0 Now we have this report -- I mean, barely treading water:\xc2\xa0 74,000 jobs created, and probably more ominously, the workforce rate --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Participation rate?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- participation rate, you\'re down at a low for almost 40 years.\xc2\xa0 What do you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Pretty much where it\'s been since 2009, but, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the White House, does the President\'s policies have anything to do -- are to blame at all for this jobs report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, as I think you note, when we talk about the monthly jobs reports, we always begin with the fact that whether it exceeds expectations or comes in below expectations, that there is more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And this report is no different.\xc2\xa0 What it does represent is 46 consecutive months of private sector job creation -- 8.2 million jobs over that period.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, 74,000 jobs is barely anything in an economy this large, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, it just reinforces that we need to continue to have job growth, economic security, economic mobility as our top priorities.\xc2\xa0 And those priorities are the President\'s priorities, and he wants to work with Congress and wants to work with others outside of Congress to advance an agenda that delivers on those priorities; that continues the recovery; that expands the opportunity that economic growth affords.</p>\n<p>So there\'s no question that when you have -- again, I think we\'ve seen periods of late where the numbers have come in way over expectations, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve see periods where they come in below.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen generally is consistent private sector job creation.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen also, labor participation rate notwithstanding, is a fall in the unemployment rate from 10 percent to 6.7 percent.\xc2\xa0 6.7 percent is too high.\xc2\xa0 It is too high.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to -- despite the drop, it is too high.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to keep working and have this as our focus, and not get hung up over ideological fights when we need to be focused on what we can do, coming together, to spur job creation and economic opportunity.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you see this as an ominous jobs report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not an economist; I think our economists were out there talking about it today.\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve seen in general over recent months has been largely positive economic data.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not suggesting this is anything beyond the latest report, but I would point you to economists to give you a broader macro picture of where we are economically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is we have work to do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to grow, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to create jobs, but we have to grow faster and we have to create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 That should be our priority here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what folks in the country expect our priorities to be.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want us re-litigating old ideological fights.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want us veering off to have debates about issues that don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to affect their lives directly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President is very focused on these matters, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about them a lot lately and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about them a lot in the coming days and weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can follow up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question about the Senate tactics -- and I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not managing the Senate floor schedule and this is done out of the Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s office -- but I mean, it affects the White House.\xc2\xa0 You have a situation where the hardball tactics of the Senate Majority Leader are alienating the Republicans who have said that they want to work with the White House on this issue.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My concern, Jon, is that Republicans who said they wanted offsets for a longer-term extension of unemployment benefits, having been presented the offsets which they said they wanted, now are suggesting they won\xe2\x80\x99t vote for it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my concern for those families.\xc2\xa0 How does that square with the goal here, which is to get that assistance into the hands of the 1.3 million Americans and their families who need it?</p>\n<p>I think, again, this is Senator Reid, he\xe2\x80\x99s the Majority Leader, he\xe2\x80\x99s taking the action here; he and Senate Democrats have proposed the offsets for the long-term extension.\xc2\xa0 But again, the debate began with Republicans saying, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need any extension of unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 Then there was a recognition by some that we did need to do it and by others that they would do it if they got offsets.\xc2\xa0 So now Senator Reid has proposed offsets for the longer-term extension and that seems to be a problem.</p>\n<p>So what is forgotten in that debate is the absolute necessity to get the aid to the American people who need it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 So I guess just to -- the White House has no concerns with the tactics that have been used by the Senate Majority Leader offering no amendments -- again, alienating the Republicans who said that they were open to supporting this.\xc2\xa0 And now you\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation where you have gridlock, nothing is happening.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I followed it -- well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no concerns?\xc2\xa0 The White House is happy with how --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the gridlock, Jon:\xc2\xa0 There was a measure to extend benefits in the way that President Bush signed into law five times, and Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t go along with it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s gridlock.\xc2\xa0 There is an effort by the Majority Leader to meet the concerns expressed by Republicans who have said sincerely that they want to extend these benefits if there are offsets.\xc2\xa0 And he put offsets on the table.\xc2\xa0 So I think that is pretty good faith and ought to be acted on.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 House appropriators -- or House and Senate appropriators are finalizing the omnibus spending package due next week.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not quite there yet.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any particular concerns with that package?\xc2\xa0 And also, would you support a short-term CR through next Saturday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Based on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard and seen, there is progress being made, and that is good.\xc2\xa0 And if they need to buy themselves a few extra days in order to complete the work, then that would be fine as long as progress is being made.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that progress is being made.</p>\n<p>Chairman Rogers and other have reinforced that this process is about government funding and is not the place to inject partisan riders.\xc2\xa0 And we hope and expect that the Republican leadership will support this principle and focus on the need to fulfill the promise of the budget agreement reached by Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan.\xc2\xa0 I hope that answers your question.\xc2\xa0 As long as there\xe2\x80\x99s progress, we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The State Department designated Ansar al-Sharia as a terrorist organization today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering why it took that long considering the affiliation with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And was it directly linked to the attack on Benghazi?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the questions, because it\xe2\x80\x99s more complicated than that, as I think you know.\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can find it here.\xc2\xa0 Because Ansar al-Sharia means Partisans of Sharia and is used by various groups in North Africa, the naming convention does not necessarily imply a centralized organization, which is why, in fact, Ansar al-Sharia was not designated, but specific Ansar al-Sharia groups were designated as terrorist organizations -- Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, in Darna and Tunisia, as well as designations were made for two individuals -- Ahmed Abu Khattalah and Sufian bin Qumu.</p>\n<p>In answer to your other statement about al Qaeda, none of these Ansar al-Sharia organizations are official affiliates -- affiliates, rather, of core al Qaeda under Ayman al-Zawahiri.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are they really -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s the same as the one in Syria, with the al Nusra.\xc2\xa0 They are not part of it, but\xc2\xa0 they are --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you what our determination is, our view, the intelligence community of the United States and our allies, that these are not affiliate of core al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 But the government is committed, the U.S. government, to taking all appropriate actions against the organizations and individuals responsible for the attacks against the United States diplomatic facilities in Libya and Tunisia, and doing everything we can to prevent similar attacks in the future.</p>\n<p>The State Department\xe2\x80\x99s announcement today of the terrorist designations is a reflection of that commitment.\xc2\xa0 Our focus continues to be working with the Libyan government to bring the perpetrators of the September 11th, 2012 Benghazi attacks to justice, and to work tirelessly to ensure the safety of our personnel serving overseas.\xc2\xa0 Likewise, we also remain committed to working with the Tunisian government to bring to justice those responsible for the September 14, 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy and American school in Tunis.</p>\n<p>For more information about the status of those investigations, I refer you to the Department of Justice and to the Department of State for any further information on the terrorist designations.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us what the President learned and when he learned about the chemical spill in West Virginia, and the level of the White House activity monitoring that over the weekend?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is aware -- I don\'t have a specific time, but he was made aware and he approved the emergency declaration that was done last night.\xc2\xa0 He asked his team --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was pretty swift.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was very swift.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a serious incident.\xc2\xa0 He asked his team to monitor the situation and provide necessary assistance.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Johnson, DHS Secretary, spoke to Governor Earl Ray Tomblin this morning about this matter.\xc2\xa0 And I have information from FEMA about what they are doing in terms of working through its regional office in Philadelphia, in close coordination with the West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to support state and local efforts to ensure public safety and health in response to the emergency conditions resulting from that chemical spill in Charleston on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this appear manageable for public health?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to FEMA for specifics about the conditions and the spill and the health -- the public safety aspect of it.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, the emergency declaration reflects that it\'s an emergency situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House reaction to 67 Democrats voting this morning in the House for this disclosure piece of legislation regarding any security breach of healthcare.gov?\xc2\xa0 The White House did not threaten yesterday to veto, but the Senate opposes this.\xc2\xa0 The House Democrats were clearly well aware of that, and yet a sizable majority -- not a sizable majority, but sizable enough to create a veto-proof majority in the House nevertheless went with Republicans.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, you\'re right, we put out statements of administration policy yesterday making clear that the administration opposes these bills, because they would impose a burdensome requirement, reporting requirement that is less effective than existing industry standards and those already in place for federal agencies that possess such information.</p>\n<p>The bottom line here is that when consumers fill out their online marketplace applications, they can trust that the information that they are providing is protected by stringent security standards and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site.\xc2\xa0 Security testing is conducted on an ongoing basis, using industry best practices to safeguard appropriately consumers\' personal information.\xc2\xa0 And the security of the system is also monitored by sensors and other tools to deter and prevent any unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you\'ve said that before, and consumers can only take your word and HHS\'s word and CMS\'s word on that.\xc2\xa0 But the legislation just says if there\'s a breach, the HHS Secretary should notify individuals affected within two days.\xc2\xa0 What is burdensome or onerous about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I would point you to the existing reporting requirements and that the effort here obviously is aimed at -- is designed by folks by and large who have as a goal sabotaging the ACA.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the security -- the important issue here, the security of the site, it already meets standards, stringent standards.\xc2\xa0 There have been no reported security breaks -- breaches.\xc2\xa0 And the proposition here is actually less effective than existing industry standards, and those already in place for federal agencies that possess such information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it trouble you that so many Democrats wanted to undermine the process?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, security is an important issue.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that everyone from the administration on down and throughout the government here takes it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 But I think we\'ve made clear in our SAPs that we oppose the legislation, made clear why, and the American people who fill out their marketplace applications can be sure that that information is protected using the highest standards -- industry standards that are available.</p>\n<p>So again, I think that the focus here ought to be on delivering in a responsible way -- which is what is happening -- the benefits of the Affordable Care Act to the American people who so demonstrably desire those benefits and the opportunities and options available to them through the marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stipulating that neither one of us are economists, I want to challenge you on something you said a moment ago when Jon brought up the labor force participation rate.\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s been --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I was thinking of a graph I saw earlier that has to do about the percentage of American adults who are employed, which has basically been the same since early 2009.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s different than the labor force participation rate, which has changed in the last year.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It has been trending downward for quite a long time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, 62.8 percent now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It has been trending downward for quite a long time predating this administration, as I\'m sure you\'re aware and will report.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am aware.\xc2\xa0 But nevertheless, if the labor force participation rate had remained constant over the year, today\'s unemployment rate wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be 6.7 percent, it would 7.9 percent, which indicates --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not an economist and don\xe2\x80\x99t know that to be true or accurate, and I would check that, but -- maybe you\'re right.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is -- Major, here\'s the fact --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is, is that people -- discouraged workers are leaving the labor force, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\'re showing up in this data.\xc2\xa0 The long-term unemployed, there are those who you\'re trying to deal with who are constantly looking for work, they would benefit from the extension of long-term emergency aid.\xc2\xa0 But there are many who are completely opting out.\xc2\xa0 They are so discouraged they\'ve become almost not only chronically unemployed, but so discouraged that they\'ve left the labor force entirely.\xc2\xa0 This seems to be a structural economic reality.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We need to take every measure we can to help the economy grow, to help it create jobs, to create economic opportunity in places like the five Promise Zones that were designated yesterday and around the country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>Remember, when we came in, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 The conditions were severe.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a situation in this country of economic expansion that has created 8.2 million private sector jobs over 46 months, an average for some time now I think of 2 million jobs per year.\xc2\xa0 Not enough.\xc2\xa0 We have more work to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as the President has made clear, the goal isn\xe2\x80\x99t just to get back to where we were, the goal is to have a situation where the chronic trend of suppressing economic mobility is arrested and reversed.\xc2\xa0 The goal is to create more ladders of opportunity for Americans who aspire to the middle class, more economic security for those Americans who are in the middle class, and more opportunities for American businesses and foreign businesses to create jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That represents the sort of circle of goals that the President has when it comes to his economic policy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he remains focused on and has been since he took office.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to health care.\xc2\xa0 When you were asked before about healthcare.gov getting a new contractor, you said it was a CMS contract issue.\xc2\xa0 I understand there are a lot of contracts, you can\xe2\x80\x99t keep up on every one of them, but you would probably acknowledge this is not just any federal contract.\xc2\xa0 And when administration officials are privately telling us the new contractor is going to get something like $90 million this year to take over the account and you have a situation where you\xe2\x80\x99re switching web portals sort of midstream here, it would seem to be kind of an important issue that would cross the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\xc2\xa0 Is he being updated on this, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t this kind of a big deal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a report in a newspaper, Ed, what I can tell you from here is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have information about a contract at CMS.\xc2\xa0 If and when I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to take a question and answer it.\xc2\xa0 But for now, when it has to do with a CMS contract that may or may not be changing, I would refer you to CMS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, you got a lot of questions on that, but I wanted to be more specific.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting story in the Huffington Post where a White House official is quoted today as suggesting the people who support this sanctions bill on the Hill -- Democrats and Republicans -- the quote is, \xe2\x80\x9dIf certain members of Congress want the U.S. to take military action, they should be upfront with the American public and say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re basically accusing Democrats like Bob Menendez of wanting to go to war.\xc2\xa0 Is that really a fair characterization?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have said all along, Ed, that we have worked cooperatively and effectively with an excellent partner in Congress in building a sanctions regime against Iran, the likes of which the world has never seen; more effective than the world has ever seen.\xc2\xa0 And we share the same goals that members of Congress of both parties share, which is the absolute need to deprive Iran of acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And our stated concern again and again is that pursuing sanctions now -- new sanctions now would actually undermine the objective here -- the objective being that we can bring about, potentially, through negotiation, a peaceful resolution of this conflict between Iran and the rest of the world in a verifiable, transparent way that would, more effectively than a military action, assure the P5-plus-1, the United States, our allies and everybody in the world, that Iran does not and is not -- does not have and is not pursuing a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand you\'re saying this could blow up a diplomatic deal, but the thing is, you\'re going further in this story, and a White House official on the record is saying that these lawmakers want the U.S. to take military action.\xc2\xa0 Can you say from the podium that Democrat Bob Menendez wants to go to war?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that Senator Menendez, Chairman Menendez wants what we want, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 He and many others in the Senate have been excellent partners in helping construct this sanctions regime, which was designed to bring Iran to the negotiating table, and which, thanks to the efforts of Congress, has achieved that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I believe that -- when it comes -- this isn\'t a debate about sanctions; obviously, this administration supports sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We built the biggest, most effective sanctions regime in history.\xc2\xa0 Our view of the current situation is that passing new sanctions legislation now would be counterproductive to the goal that we all share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the obvious problem with that is that if we want, as everyone does, to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, and we make it harder if not impossible to pursue achieving that goal peacefully, then our options become very limited.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not about motive, it\'s about the potential outcomes that would be negative for the United States and our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President himself has repeatedly said he has the military option on the table, he should not take that off the table.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And he won\'t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it would unfair for people to suggest he wants to go to war, right?\xc2\xa0 He\'s just saying I want to have that option.\xc2\xa0 So how can you possibly accuse Democrats and Republicans on the Hill of wanting to take military action?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\'re saying.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, I think that the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the quote.\xc2\xa0 Are you running from that quote, is my question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every one of a hundred senators what their personal views are on whether or not military force ought to be used in Iran.\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t give a blanket statement about how they all feel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I do know is when it comes to Senator Menendez and all of the partners who have assisted this administration over the years in building this sanctions regime is that we share a common goal, which is to deprive Iran of the opportunity of acquiring a nuclear weapon, and to do so through negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we built the sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 And our strong concern is that passage of sanctions at this time would negatively affect and perhaps scuttle the negotiations that are underway, and then make it much harder if not impossible to achieve our objective peacefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, you\'ve probably seen the reports that President Karzai is suggesting he\'s not going to sign the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And I asked you a couple of days ago -- when was the last time the President spoke to the U.S. commander on the ground in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the President\'s conversations with military leaders, which he has with some regularity, as well as his civilian leaders in the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is our views on this and our position on this remains the same.\xc2\xa0 The bilateral security agreement was negotiated in good faith and endorsed by the loya jirga, and it needs to be signed, it ought to be signed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why can\'t you say when was the last time he spoke to the General?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we read out every conversation that the President -- I know we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out every conversation the President has with his military leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it recently?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think I\'ve answered the question.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Michael.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on the CMS issue -- just another question here.\xc2\xa0 I understand you\'re not going to give us an answer on this substantive question, but it wasn\'t that long ago that you guys were deeply involved in every detail, contracting and otherwise, with this website -- holding sessions in this building, piped into the War Room and all sorts of other things -- and that you guys were saying that Denis McDonough and other top officials here --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can be clearer and just sort of get to your -- but here\'s what I know.\xc2\xa0 A newspaper has reported something.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 CMS, as I\'ve seen, has not confirmed it publicly.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a gap there, and people ought to go to CMS and get what information they can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m saying is, I\'ve gotten now, from you and from others in this building, that it\'s not a -- that a contracting issue with CMS is not something that is of -- that you guys would even know or would even be interested in, it seems like.\xc2\xa0 And so the question is, have we moved past the point where Denis McDonough and the President and the top officials here and Zients and everybody else were so interested in --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there are distinctions here, Michael, if I could.\xc2\xa0 The issue of a legal contract between an agency and a private contractor is something that is worked out obviously by counsel between the agency and counsel for a contractor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the mechanisms by which that is done effectively, including all the changes in repairs and improvements made to healthcare.gov, obviously the White House has been and is very engaged in that process.\xc2\xa0 I\'m telling you that when it comes to the status of a contract, I don\'t have an answer.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to CMS; it\'s a CMS contract.\xc2\xa0 And if CMS has more information to provide, they will.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\'t at this time, that\'s because they don\'t have information to provide on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you guys are also trying to find out from them?\xc2\xa0 Or is it something that\'s really not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m telling you is that there\'s not information that I have to give to you today.\xc2\xa0 And there is some distance between a newspaper report and what the agency involved is saying at this time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve spoken to two insurance industry executives who say there are ongoing problems with the 834s.\xc2\xa0 They say they\xe2\x80\x99re as high as 5 percent.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a percentage?\xc2\xa0 Because last time I heard the administration weigh in on this it was far lower than 5 percent?\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering if you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that since December it\'s been close to zero.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying it\'s much higher.\xc2\xa0 So are they wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Close to zero.\xc2\xa0 So if you take 5 percent going back to October 1st, obviously the percentage --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this was a conversation I had today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, but some of the reporting on this has blended some of the data and the months involved here.\xc2\xa0 So if you go back to -- look, the percentage was extremely high in October.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the bad news.\xc2\xa0 The silver lining in that very dark cloud was that there weren\'t that many people who got through the system in October.\xc2\xa0 So that high percentage of a low number is not that big.\xc2\xa0 What has been the case since the improvements were made to the website and since December 1st is that the backend issues have been aggressively addressed and the problems have been addressed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For percentage figures, I should be a little careful.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have them available right now.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a question on this in a while.\xc2\xa0 But I know CMS does and has been answering these questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, I mean, these are conversations that I had today.\xc2\xa0 And they feel as though the percentage has actually been downplayed by the administration.\xc2\xa0 So given that you don\'t have percentages --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying "they" -- if you want to name names and tell me, I\'m sure I can put them in touch with people at CMS and others who are working on the website.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that there are ongoing problems --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You actually don\xe2\x80\x99t have to name names.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to name names.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know who they are.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the ongoing problems --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s an NSA joke.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sticking to health care, given the ongoing problems and that there are some, however high you would put the percentage, how engaged is the administration right now in terms of working with insurance companies and consumers to help iron out the people who have orphan plans, who say that they have signed up for coverage and insurance companies say we still can\'t find their plans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been aggressively engaged with issuers and with individuals on everyone affected by the so-called "backend problems," and that includes directly reaching out to individuals to making sure that when it comes to payments and other issues, making sure that everyone who has enrolled in a plan is taking all the steps necessary to make sure that they have the coverage that they desire and which they enrolled in, and that we continue to work with issuers to make sure that the data they\'re getting through the backend, the 834 forms, is accurate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how concerned is the President -- there are some stories that are starting to emerge, in the L.A. Times for example, about consumers who are getting the runaround, waiting on the phone for long periods of time, not getting the answers that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for in terms of their coverage.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the insurance companies, from the administration.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they feel like they\xe2\x80\x99re getting the runaround.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, are you sort of broadly saying -- are you identifying specific problems?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are ongoing problems.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In a limited number of instances, consumers are getting help through our casework system to address some of these backend issues.\xc2\xa0 I have a little more information for you here.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to casework process to handle individual situations, of the 1.1 million individuals who have enrolled in private coverage through the federal marketplace, there are only 13,000 casework cases in the system right now that CMS is working on with issuers, where people are having enrollment issues or other issues and they are actively working with health plans to address and resolve them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my calculator, but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a relatively low percentage -- 13,000 out of 1.1 million.\xc2\xa0 But every one of them is getting direct attention so that we can resolve this working with the insurers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Jay, can you comment on the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s decision to recognize the same-sex marriages that were performed in Utah over the past several weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you the President welcomes the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the federal government, for purposes of federal law, will recognize the same-sex marriages that were lawfully performed in Utah before a stay was issued.\xc2\xa0 For more, I would point you to what the Attorney General said and to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 But the President welcomes that determination by the AG.</p>\n<p>Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions on NSA.\xc2\xa0 You were asked something earlier this week about the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, but now that we are pretty sure -- we have the date that the President is going to speak next week --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Pretty sure?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are pretty sure that their report will come out after the President speaks.\xc2\xa0 They have said late January, early February.\xc2\xa0 There are some folks on the Hill, even from your own Democratic Party, civil libertarians who don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait until the independent group gives their report.\xc2\xa0 I know you were sort of asked about this but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully understand or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President has met with members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties [Oversight] Board, and when it comes to the timing of the report, you can ask them.\xc2\xa0 But today, the meeting the President had the other day -- I think it was yesterday -- was an opportunity for the President to hear from them directly about the very issues that they\xe2\x80\x99re working on ahead of their report being issued so that our internal review takes into account their views and their input, which is very valuable.\xc2\xa0 The President sought it and has engaged with them directly for that reason.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the timing of the release of their report, but the work they\xe2\x80\x99ve done is very much a piece of the input that the President and his team have taken in putting together their review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that mean they\xe2\x80\x99re verbally giving a report before --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there is paper attached to it.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to you when they\xe2\x80\x99re releasing their report.\xc2\xa0 I know that they met with the President and discussed the issues that they\xe2\x80\x99d been reviewing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And secondly, yesterday you indicated that you would give out the names of the companies that are here today at the White House, the industry folks and NSA --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I said that.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is I said there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a further readout of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the names of the companies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to list the names of the companies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, you could get them.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last December -- well, last month, I guess, you said that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the sanctions bill would pass the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the White House assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the bill would be detrimental to our efforts to pursue a resolution with Iran through the P5-plus-1, a peaceful resolution.\xc2\xa0 I think that we remain hopeful that Congress will not pass such a sanctions bill because of the negative effect that would have on the ongoing negotiations and the potential to resolve this peacefully.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make legislative predictions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We got that statement from Rice last night, which is a very strong statement.\xc2\xa0 Now, during the briefing, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Reuters story from the United Nations quoting sources briefed on U.S. discussions saying the U.S. has weighing targeted sanctions against South Sudan.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 And also talk about confidence in President Kiir at this point?\xc2\xa0 Is there any wavering in confidence in his leadership?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything that I can give to you on the question of -- on the first question regarding sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to Ambassador Rice\'s statement in general about the situation in South Sudan and to what I\'ve said in the past, but I have no update on our view of that matter, which is very concerning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This story also talks about frustrations for the President.\xc2\xa0 Has he become increasingly more frustrated with not only President Kiir but the former Vice President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re all, from the President on down, concerned about the violence there and the stability -- or the instability that it creates.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go further than that.</p>\n<p>Andrei.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the Russian journalists will be celebrating their professional holiday, the National Day of the Press, in Russia.\xc2\xa0 And when I was thinking about this --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Does that mean nobody is going to be here, no briefing?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably right.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever got to celebrate that holiday even when I was living there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is what I want to ask you about.\xc2\xa0 Living here, I\'ve often wondered at the enormous amount of different causes that I recognized here by all sorts of national days, national weeks, national months.\xc2\xa0 Why is there no national day for the press?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I want an answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Amen, brother.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe the people\xe2\x80\x9d petition?\xc2\xa0 I hear it coming.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Every day is a national day for the press.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I think the view that the American people have about if not the media itself but about the importance that in our democracy that the free media play is enshrined in our Bill of Rights.\xc2\xa0 And when you got that, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need a holiday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So the people here do not deserve a holiday in your opinion?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they avail themselves of other holidays.\xc2\xa0 There\'s one coming up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want to say anything to the Russians on their national day for the media?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Russian?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 \xd1\x81 \xd0\x9d\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2\xd1\x8b\xd0\xbc \xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb4\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc!\xc2\xa0 (Happy New Year!)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you just said the President welcomes the decision by DOJ to recognize the same-sex marriages performed in Utah, but to what extent was the President involved in reaching the decision getting there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President simply welcomes the decision.\xc2\xa0 This is an action and a determination taken by and done by the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously has been both public -- has expressed his view publicly about same-sex marriage and the need for equal rights for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they discussed this specific issue.\xc2\xa0 This was a determination by the AG.</p>\n<p>Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had to cut out, so I hope I didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss this question.\xc2\xa0 But Afghanistan says it\'s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The one about the holiday for journalists?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the key question of the day.\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan says it\'s going to release a large number of prisoners that the U.S. regards as extremely dangerous.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions on that.\xc2\xa0 The first one:\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. regard this as a deal-breaker in terms of the security agreement?\xc2\xa0 And the second one is, President Karzai is said to be very upset over the references in Bob Gates\'s book to President Obama apparently not liking him at all, and that being one of the reasons why he is releasing the prisoners.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that perhaps Bob Gates should have waited to write this book and known that he should have waited to write this book, being a former Secretary of Defense?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the last question about memoirs and the decision to write them and when to publish them, I think I answered that earlier in the week.\xc2\xa0 So I won\'t add to that answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now that we have -- now that Karzai has responded.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have very concrete and serious negotiations with the Afghan government about very serious and concrete matters.\xc2\xa0 And we negotiated with the Afghan government the bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we engage with Kabul, our colleagues in Kabul -- through our colleagues in Kabul, with the Afghan government every day.\xc2\xa0 We are very concerned about the release of any detainees who would pose a threat to U.S. forces.\xc2\xa0 And this is an issue we take quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 And we are in touch through our embassy in Kabul and others in Afghanistan on this matter.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to ISAF and DOD for more.</p>\n<p>On the other matter, I think we have a series of engagements with -- we engage with the Afghan government on a series of issues, including prisoners, including the bilateral security agreement, including our commitment economically.\xc2\xa0 And those talks are ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is your concern about whether this could be a deal-breaker?\xc2\xa0 You want this signed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re saying that that\'s what you read in a report somewhere.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned because we believe it ought to be signed and it should have been signed before the end of the year, which was the goal I think stated by both parties to the negotiations that produced the bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve been saying that it needs to be signed promptly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is apparently a confidential cable from the Ambassador saying that Karzai is not going to sign it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t comment on confidential cables.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that it has been our view, it has been the view of the Afghan people represented by the loya jirga that the BSA ought to be signed.</p>\n<p>Is that it?\xc2\xa0 Oh wait, week ahead.\xc2\xa0 I have to make a change to Friday here, hold on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President will welcome the President of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain, Mariano Rajoy Brey, to the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President will highlight the strength and depth of the United States\' relationship with Spain.\xc2\xa0 The President and President Rajoy will discuss promoting economic growth and new jobs, support for the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, cooperation within NATO, Latin America, shared challenges in North Africa and the Middle East and other topics of mutual interest.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will hold a Cabinet meeting, which the Vice President and obviously his Cabinet members will attend.\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon, the President will welcome the 2013 NBA Champion Miami Heat to the White House to honor the team on winning their second straight championship title.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, as I think I mentioned yesterday, the President will travel to Raleigh, North Carolina, for an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President and First Lady will host an event here at the White House on expanding college opportunity.</p>\n<p>And on Friday, in addition to attending meetings here at the White House, he\'ll make remarks outlining or giving information about, making remarks about the outcomes of the review that we have undertaken that he has led on the issue of signal intelligence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some shots with LeBron while he is here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Unless they set up a court in the East Room, I wouldn\'t count on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:11 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
