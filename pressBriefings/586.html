Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:18 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, is speaking at 2:30 p.m.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to shoot for a wrap of this briefing around 2:00 p.m. so that everyone who wants to attend can make their way over to the site.</p>\n<p>With that, I go to Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a new IG report from Treasury that says that the health care subsidies in the insurance exchanges may be vulnerable to fraud.\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware of this risk?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I would say that the IRS aggressively safeguards our information systems and combats tax fraud.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts to protect the integrity of our Affordable Care Act programs are no exception.\xc2\xa0 And as the IRS has said, they have a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong, effective system in place for administering the premium tax credit.\xc2\xa0 We have a proven track record of safely and securely transmitting federal tax information and we will have a robust and secure process in place to deliver this important credit for taxpayers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>And beyond that, I would refer you to the IRS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they also say, beyond what you say there, that these subsidies are vulnerable to fraud.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would tell you is that the experts who do this every day over at the IRS have said what I just read to you.\xc2\xa0 And I would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you disputing the IG report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m pointing you to the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s response to the IG report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was the White House aware of this possible risk before the report came out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the IRS has a great deal of experience in protecting taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 information and would point you to what the IRS says.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question, though, whether the White House was aware.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have any more information for you on that.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the IRS has responded to the IG report and the IRS handles taxpayer information and does it effectively.\xc2\xa0 I would point to what they said in response to the report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic, American Alan Gross is marking his fourth year in a Cuban prison.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s written a letter to the President asking that he personally get involved in trying to seek his release.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President has seen that letter, and does he have any plans to get more personally involved in trying to seek Mr. Gross\xe2\x80\x99s release?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you for the question.\xc2\xa0 Today is the fourth anniversary of Alan Gross\xe2\x80\x99s incarceration in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Cuban authorities arrested Mr. Gross on December 3, 2009, and later sentenced him to 15 years in prison for facilitating uncensored Internet contact between a small religious community on the island and the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gross is a 64-year-old husband, father, and dedicated professional with a long history of providing aid to underserved communities in more than 50 countries.\xc2\xa0 We reiterate today our call for the Cuban government to release Alan Gross.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gross\xe2\x80\x99s detention remains an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Regarding your question about the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement on this, the President has, himself, personally engaged foreign leaders and other international figures to use their influence with Cuba to promote Mr. Gross\xe2\x80\x99s release.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has kept Mr. Gross\xe2\x80\x99s case at the forefront of discussions with the Cuban government and made clear the importance the United States places on his welfare.\xc2\xa0 They have also engaged a wide range of foreign counterparts and urged them to advocate for Mr. Gross\xe2\x80\x99s release.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President has received this letter, though?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has seen it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that he is engaged in this in the ways that I described, and that this is always very much a part of any discussions we have with the Cuban government and also with those governments and others who have influence with the Cuban government.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to something you talked a little bit about yesterday, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the East China Sea defense identification zone question.\xc2\xa0 China has praised the United States\xe2\x80\x99 action, giving advice to its commercial flights to notify Chinese authorities of their position, causing some consternation in Japan, which, as you know, has instructed its commercial airliners not to do that.\xc2\xa0 Why that difference in approach?\xc2\xa0 And what about the problems that causes with Japan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer that question, which I appreciate.\xc2\xa0 We remain steadfastly committed to our allies and partners and we will maintain close and constant communication with our Korean and Japanese allies, including, as you know, during the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Contrary to prior reporting, the FAA did not issue guidance to U.S. carriers with regard to the specific Chinese notice to airmen.\xc2\xa0 It has, however, reiterated longstanding practice and policy that for the safety and security of passengers on commercial airlines, U.S. civilian aircraft flying internationally operate consistent with notices to airmen issued by foreign countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we have said, and I said yesterday, the U.S. government does not accept or recognize China\xe2\x80\x99s newly declared ADIZ.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, U.S. military aircraft have been instructed to continue to operate normally in the area in line with U.S. government policy.\xc2\xa0 The United States remains deeply concerned with -- concerned that, rather, China announced the establishment of an East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone because this appears to be a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, a highly sensitive area, and thus raises regional tensions and increases the risk of miscalculation, confrontation and accidents.</p>\n<p>The United States urges China not to implement the ADIZ, to refrain from taking similar actions elsewhere in the region, and to work with other countries, including Japan and North Korea -- or rather, Japan and South Korea -- to establish confidence-building measures, including emergency communications channels, to address the dangers its recent announcement has created and to lower tensions.</p>\n<p>We note that China announced the ADIZ without prior consultations even though the newly announced ADIZ overlaps with parts of the longstanding ADIZs of Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, and includes territories administered by other countries, as I mentioned yesterday.</p>\n<p>So I want to make that clarification that this was a reissuance of longstanding guidance regarding commercial aircraft.\xc2\xa0 But our position on this that we do not recognize it and call on China not to implement it remains clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just jumping to the Affordable Care Act implementation, there\xe2\x80\x99s reporting that enrollment records for a large number of people who have signed up for health plans contain errors that could cause problems for the insurers who have to process that information.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any deadlines for cleaning up the backend of the website?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am very glad you asked that question, because that statistic that was cited in a newspaper today does not reflect at all the picture of what is happening right now.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s an accurate picture of issues with the backend of the system even going back weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I can tell you is that our general contractor has stood up a team of experts who are working already closely with issuers to make sure that every 834 form, every one -- past and present\xc2\xa0 -- is accurate.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that and are confident that they will be able to ensure that accuracy in time for the January 1st beginning of coverage for those who have signed up for it.</p>\n<p>We have made huge improvements to the 834 forms, including over the weekend -- a process that has been going on for weeks, but including over the weekend some significant upgrades that we believe address many of the problems with the 834 forms.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that some of this reporting about this seems to be a reiteration of the basic assertion with which we do not disagree that the website was functioning poorly in October.\xc2\xa0 But it is functioning much more effectively now, and that includes on the backend with the 834 forms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I promised yesterday that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do all front row at the top.\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, over the holiday weekend, the President engaged with senators on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us where the President\xe2\x80\x99s outreach is on negotiations regarding Iran and nuclear talks and the deal that has been in place in Geneva?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that our position is clear, that the -- it is the right position to take, rather, that the agreement reached by the P5-plus-1 with Iran needs to be implemented, and that both the President and Congress have a responsibility to fully test whether we can achieve a comprehensive solution through diplomatic means before pursuing alternatives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Passing any new sanctions right now will undermine our efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to this issue by giving the Iranians an excuse to push the terms of the agreement on their side.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, new sanctions are unnecessary right now because our core sanctions architecture remains in place and the Iranians continue to be under extraordinary pressure.\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt in Iran that should this agreement fail, Congress and this administration will quickly impose harsh new sanctions.\xc2\xa0 It would make more sense to hold our powder, or keep our powder dry, rather, until we see whether Iran violates the understanding we have reached, and act accordingly at that time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If we pass sanctions now, even with a deferred trigger, which has been discussed, the Iranians and likely our international partners will see us as having negotiated in bad faith and this would have a bearing on our core sanctions architecture.</p>\n<p>So as you know, the agreement that was reached contains with it verification procedures that will, if implemented by the Iranians, assure the P5-plus-1 that they have halted the -- that Iran has halted progress on its nuclear program and has rolled it back in some important areas.\xc2\xa0 The relief is modest and reversible and does not -- deliberately does not affect the core sanctions architecture which this administration built.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the purpose of sanctions was obviously to press Iran to see if Iran would change its behavior.\xc2\xa0 The preliminary agreement reached with the P5-plus-1 is a step along the road of the process of testing whether they will change their behavior.\xc2\xa0 So we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to continue that process and to hold in abeyance, if you will, any new sanctions for the time when they might be necessary and more effective.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously the diplomacy is in a difficult position right now, tenuous.\xc2\xa0 Would the diplomatic process be enhanced by the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit at any time in the second term?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about reports that are utterly false about a planned visit, I will simply say they\xe2\x80\x99re utterly false.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the website and healthcare.gov generally, does the President believe that for people who have spent hours and tried and failed to log on or failed to enroll, or for people who are spending time with their insurers and having difficulties there, is there any make-good that the President or the administration or the website can do to try to compensate people for the hassle that has been --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you ask, because as I think CMS announced today, there were over 1 million visits to the site yesterday -- 1 million.\xc2\xa0 13,000 consumers who were put in the queuing system requested email notifications as to when to come back to the site, and all were invited back the same day.\xc2\xa0 Sixty percent of those folks who were sent an email saying to come back have returned.</p>\n<p>And I think what this shows is that in spite of the problems that the website had upon launch and that we have been addressing aggressively over these days and weeks, there is an enormous amount of demand for quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that is a reminder to all of us, and we hope to everyone in Washington and around the country, that the Affordable Care Act is not about a website.\xc2\xa0 The website is a means to an end, and the end is the provision of quality, affordable health insurance to millions of Americans, many of whom have not had access to quality, affordable health insurance in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is also about benefits that everyone in this room enjoys, as well as those who don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance or who are shopping for insurance on the exchanges today.\xc2\xa0 That includes the fact that your twin sister, if you had one -- maybe you do -- cannot any longer be charged double for the same insurance that you buy.\xc2\xa0 It means that those of you with children between the ages of 18 and 26 can stay on your plan now, whereas before they could not.\xc2\xa0 It means that millions of Americans avail themselves of preventive care that they could not before.\xc2\xa0 And it means that the 105 million Americans are no longer subject to lifetime limits on their health coverage, and up to 129 million Americans who have a preexisting condition for which they could have been denied coverage or charged more up to now are protected because denying them coverage is prohibited beginning in 2014.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Affordable Care Act is about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we all need to remember -- we, who are working on improvements to the website, working on talking about the Affordable Care Act -- that this about providing quality, affordable health insurance, and the security and peace of mind that comes with having quality, affordable health insurance for millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fact that the website launch was hugely problematic is on us, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very candid about that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s been our responsibility to improve it as quickly and effectively as possible.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last 48 hours that significant improvements have been made and that the demand that we saw initially is still there, despite the challenges that you identify.\xc2\xa0 And we owe it to the American people who had been struggling with the website in October to make it better so that they can get the insurance that they clearly want.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you just describe what the President is going to do every day on health care between now and December 23rd?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Every day for 21 days?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I\'m asking are we going to hear from him every day.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have that time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the plan between now and the end of December?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, today, the President in about an hour will hold an event here to deliver remarks about the Affordable Care Act, highlighting the benefits that have already kicked in for millions of middle-class families who have insurance, and the importance of continuing to help as many hardworking Americans as possible enroll for their new health care options through the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 Americans who have personally benefited from the health care law and supporters of reform will join the President at today\xe2\x80\x99s event.</p>\n<p>As our work continues to improve healthcare.gov, more Americans are signing up for insurance every day and are already benefiting from the health care law.\xc2\xa0 Healthcare.gov met our self-imposed November 30th deadline, and even as we continue to make improvements to the website -- and we are and we will -- we will also remind the public about how the Affordable Care Act is already making a positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 The benefits of these consumer protections will only accumulate in the weeks and months ahead -- some of them I just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 While work continues on the website, we think it is important that proponents of health reform undertake a renewed effort to refocus the public and the public\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the benefits of the law that have already been implemented.</p>\n<p>And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\'re going to be doing.\xc2\xa0 The President is kicking off that new effort with the event today.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have a day-by-day plan.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we\'ll talk about preventive care, we\'ll talk about preexisting conditions, we\'ll talk about slowing the growth in health care costs.\xc2\xa0 There was significant data on that piece of it of late that demonstrates that for the past three years, the growth in health care costs has been the slowest in half a century -- that is the three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.\xc2\xa0 I think that conflicts rather significantly with the predictions made by opponents of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>There was a significant story in The New York Times today in the business section about the fact that the costs of the Affordable Care Act are actually coming in below estimates.\xc2\xa0 So this is just a sample of the kinds of things that we want to talk about as the month progresses and as obviously millions of Americans are shopping for health insurance and enrolling in plans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what can we expect -- how frequently can we --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want to know where you\'re going to go and what events you\'re going to cover?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 What I want to know -- this is a crucial period.\xc2\xa0 You lost a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 You have until December 23rd for people who need it by January 1st.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect to see him frequently talking about health care?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what have you planned for him in these weeks, which is kind of a crucial period?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I told you now it wouldn\'t be a surprise when it happened, Mara.\xc2\xa0 We are going to be engaged, the President is going to be engaged.\xc2\xa0 He is kicking it off today -- I would point you to his remarks.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve given you a little bit of a preview of some of the things we\'re going to be talking about and focusing on.\xc2\xa0 We plan to use a number of different venues to push this message to the public, including press events, digital media pushes, and highlighting the stories of Americans who are being helped by these specific benefits.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this top priority between now and Christmas?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has many priorities.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly one of his high, top priorities.</p>\n<p>Christie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Maybe this is asking you to state the obvious, but could you talk about the thought behind that strategy a little bit?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you think if people hear more of the benefits that will make people who are currently not going to sign up more eager to do so?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, everybody in this room for the most part and in this building and elsewhere in Washington who are focused on this issue have been focused on the problems with the website and some of the other issues with the rollout -- and that\'s appropriate given the challenges that we faced with the website.\xc2\xa0 But it is important, too, as the improvements have been made to the website and more and more Americans are visiting the site and having it function effectively for them that we remember what the ACA is all about, what the benefits are that are being provided to millions of Americans, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the website.\xc2\xa0 The website was important and the fixes we\'ve made were absolutely essential.\xc2\xa0 The fixes we will make are important, too.\xc2\xa0 But the Affordable Care Act is about the things I just mentioned before.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to -- I think I talked about this yesterday -- I think that the numbers we\'ve seen demonstrate that the demand and interest remains extremely high.\xc2\xa0 What this effort is about is focusing on some of the benefits -- or the many benefits that the Affordable Care Act has already delivered and will deliver beginning on January 1, 2014.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President talks about the economy tomorrow, is that a health care speech, or is that something --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will tell you this since you asked that tomorrow at 11:20 a.m., the President will deliver remarks on the economy at the ARC, which is a Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 The ARC is a campus located in D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s Ward 8 with a mission of working to improve the quality of life for residents of Ward 8.\xc2\xa0 The ARC is home to 11 nonprofit agencies, all of which share the goal of helping children and adults reach their full potential.\xc2\xa0 That event is being sponsored by the Center for American Progress.</p>\n<p>Those remarks will focus on the economy.\xc2\xa0 We will continue, beginning today, pushing -- or discussing the benefits of the Affordable Care Act in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks tomorrow will be on the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'re not worried about message whiplash there at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that -- no, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I think that the economy is elemental to most Americans, and it is the principal focus of this presidency.\xc2\xa0 Remember, when he took office our economy was in free fall.\xc2\xa0 We were losing 800,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 The economy in the fourth quarter of 2008 contracted dramatically in the worst recession we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And he has -- the President and his team have worked assiduously over these years to halt that decline and reverse it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen sustained economic growth and job creation for a long time now.</p>\n<p>But we are not where we need to be.\xc2\xa0 We need to continue focusing on growing the economy.\xc2\xa0 We need to continue focusing on investing in those areas of the economy that will create jobs today and greater economic growth and job creation in the future.\xc2\xa0 So those are the things that the President will want to continue to address.\xc2\xa0 And health care security is an element of economic security, so they are interrelated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get up and back.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even before this new push on Obamacare, the polls have been showing that the law and the program itself are just stubbornly unpopular.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, does the President believe that this program will ever be popular?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes and the polls reflect that the elements of the Affordable Care Act and the benefits that it provides are popular and supported by majorities of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as a whole it\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, also, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that a lot of the polls that have been discussed, when you combine those who support the law as it is, those who wish it were more -- or different on the liberal side, if you will, and those who believe that we ought to fix it, fix the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with it, rather than discard it and repeal it -- that discard and repeal is a distinctly minority position, because most Americans believe that the status quo ante is not a good place to be -- the status quo ante where insurance companies could cancel your policy for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 They could deny you insurance because you had a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 They could deny your child insurance because he or she had asthma.\xc2\xa0 They could charge your twin sister double what they charge you.\xc2\xa0 And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But people may want it to be single payer, but it\xe2\x80\x99s never going to be single payer.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I think you understand that\xe2\x80\x99s not the whole thing that I was saying, Jim.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, has there been an enormous fight for years now about whether we should reform the health care system or not, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 And that fight has been highly ideological and political fundamentally.\xc2\xa0 When you ask people, do they believe that insurance companies ought to be prohibited from denying you insurance because you have a preexisting condition, I think we\'ll take the numbers on the side of no -- I mean, yes, they ought to be prohibited from doing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you ask them, should women be charged double for the same insurance policy that men get, they\xe2\x80\x99ll say no.\xc2\xa0 Do they want the benefits of free preventive care; do they want the benefits that have been provided to millions and millions of Americans for prescription drug costs, and the rebates that millions of Americans have received because of provisions in the Affordable Care Act that ensure that insurance companies dedicate the appropriate amount of their expenditures on providing coverage as opposed to administrative and other costs.</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on providing the benefits, we\xe2\x80\x99re not focused on the polls.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to the backend process, I mean, you said you were confident that these issues are going to be worked out before January 1st, but obviously you can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that there might be some folks out there who might see potentially a gap in their coverage, because they thought they were insured but their enrollment package did not get to the insurance company properly.\xc2\xa0 So can the administration guarantee to people that if they get a hospital bill or a medical bill for thousands of dollars that should have been covered under Obamacare, but because of this potential gap in coverage that was inadvertently caused because of these computer problems, that they won\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay that bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, first of all, there\xe2\x80\x99s not an insurance policy called Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to your viewers that they understand that they\xe2\x80\x99re purchasing private insurance, first of all.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, the general contractor, QSSI, has stood up a team of experts working very closely already with insurers to make sure that every 834 form, past and present, is accurate in time for January 1st.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to achieve that.</p>\n<p>Going back to the story that was cited earlier today, even though we know that that -- or believe that the description is inaccurate in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening today, even if you look back at the worst period after the launch and the troubles we had with the website, the fact is very few people, as we know now -- because we have the October numbers -- were enrolling.\xc2\xa0 So the universe of people who might have, in their enrollment, had problems with 834 forms is not particularly large, which is an outcome of the problems we had with the website.\xc2\xa0 And the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get socked with a medical bill because of an inadvertent gap?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you that the contractor and the issuers are working together and will make sure that every 834 form, both past and present, October 1st forward, is accurate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And let me ask you just very quickly on -- last week, the National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, said to President Karzai in Afghanistan that if this bilateral security agreement is not signed the United States and NATO may pull all of our forces, all the forces there on the ground in Afghanistan, out of that country around the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 Is that a real threat?\xc2\xa0 Could that really happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as Ambassador Rice noted last week, we have concluded negotiations, and deferring the signature of the agreement until after next year\xe2\x80\x99s elections is not a viable option.\xc2\xa0 It would not provide the United States and our NATO allies the clarity necessary to plan for a potential post-2014 military presence, nor would it provide Afghans with the certainty they deserve regarding their future in the critical months preceding elections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Moreover, the lack of a signed bilateral security agreement would jeopardize NATO and other nations\xe2\x80\x99 pledges of assistance made at the Chicago and Tokyo conferences in 2012.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Rice reiterated that without a prompt signature the United States would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We simply can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is everybody negotiated in good faith, there was an agreement, there is substantial support for that agreement in Afghanistan, and we believe it ought to be signed promptly.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Iran, just a clarification on the sanctions bill.\xc2\xa0 If Congress were to pass such a bill, would the President veto it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, all I can tell you is that we strongly believe that passing new sanctions now will result in our international partners, as well as Iran, seeing us as having negotiated that agreement in bad faith, which would then have a bearing on our core sanctions architecture.\xc2\xa0 So the passing of new sanctions during this period would actually undermine the overall core sanctions architecture, which this administration took the lead in building with our international partners and with the essential assistance of Congress.</p>\n<p>So I think our view and our position, which we have expressed clearly in many meetings with members of Congress, is that the sanctions regime that they helped us build has provided this opportunity.\xc2\xa0 It has succeeded in the sense that the sanctions were designed to pressure Tehran into changing its behavior.\xc2\xa0 And because of the impact of the sanctions, Tehran has changed its behavior, or indicated that it is willing to change its behavior.\xc2\xa0 And we had a series of negotiations with the P5-plus-1 in Geneva; the result of those negotiations was the agreement, the preliminary agreement reached by the P5-plus-1 with Iran, and we now foresee implementation of that agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if Iran abides by the elements of that agreement, it will result in the positive development that there is a halt to progress in their nuclear program, as well as the rolling back of elements of that program, which would essentially put time on the clock as we continue to test the theory that Iran is willing to take the necessary steps to assure the world, the United Nations and everyone else, that it will abide by its international commitments and it will in a verifiable, transparent way forsake any ambitions for a nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>We believe that Congress should hold and reserve the options of passing new sanctions if the moment arises when Iran has failed to comply with its agreement, and that taking that action would have a positive result as opposed to the negative result that I just mentioned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But my question is a very simple one:\xc2\xa0 Would the President veto a new sanctions bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a statement of administration policy on a specific bill.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is we strongly oppose, for all the reasons I discussed -- and we are engaged in discussions with numerous lawmakers about this issue<br/>\n\t-- the passage of new sanctions at this time because of the reasons I just enumerated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are Senator Menendez and Senator Corker wrong when they say that this interim agreement does do what the Iranians says it does, which establishes a right to enrich?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think if you read the agreement, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear what it does and does not do.\xc2\xa0 What the President said and others is that Iran has the right to a peaceful nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 The negotiations over the next six months, if Iran complies with the preliminary agreement, will address a whole host of issues.</p>\n<p>What this President has made clear and his policies have proven out is that he is committed to the fundamental principle that Iran must not have a nuclear weapon, and he has made sure that all options available to him to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon remain on the table, and they remain on the table today.</p>\n<p>The whole purpose of building up the sanctions regime with the unprecedented international consensus that the administration and the President built was to test whether or not Iran could be pressured to come to a diplomatic resolution to this challenge rather than a military resolution to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But the question is, is there a recognition that Iran has the right to enrich uranium, which of course is a critical step in the path towards building a bomb.\xc2\xa0 The agreement it seems at least implies that they have such a right, and the agreement says that a final accord \xe2\x80\x9cwould involve a mutually defined enrichment program.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How is that not right in words there saying that they have a right to enrich?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would not impute added meaning to words that are printed in black and white.\xc2\xa0 What I would tell you is that the President has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cFinal accord would involve a mutually defined enrichment program.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s saying a final accord --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I could discuss with you for many minutes and hours probably what that might and could mean in the full resolution of this through a six-month process.\xc2\xa0 What the President has made clear is that Iran has the right to peaceful nuclear energy.\xc2\xa0 What the President has also made clear is that he is adamantly opposed to and will not allow for Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that is the threat that has been posed by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0 That is the problem that was created by Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s flouting of its international obligations and its refusal to demonstrate to the international community that it did not have non-civilian designs for its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And it is the commitment that Iran will have to make in a transparent and verifiable way if there is to be an accord with the international community through the P5-plus-1 process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Jay, finally, I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to Senator Menendez, who said that you were fear-mongering in the way you were characterizing his position on these talks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I said and what I believe is and we believe is the case is that the construction of the sanctions regime was meant to pressure Iran to change its behavior; that the impact of the sanctions on the Iranian economy, on the Iranian currency would hopefully bring Iran to the table with a new disposition towards resolving its commitments with the international community with regards to nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 That regime, which this President and this administration working with our partners and allies has constructed, has been effective in the sense that we have seen a change or a potential change in Iranian behavior that has led to the negotiations in the wake of the elections in Iran and to the preliminary agreement that was reached in Geneva.</p>\n<p>Since that\xe2\x80\x99s what the sanctions are for, i.e. to test whether or not this can be resolved peacefully, the alternative, which is, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve described, our view is that if you pass sanctions now and undermine the core sanctions architecture and cause our allies and partners internationally as well as Iran to view us as having negotiated in bad faith, the result is that you create a situation where keeping the commitment of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon leaves you with very few options, which is for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s saying you were fear-mongering.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that Senator Menendez and every lawmaker up there who is rightfully concerned and has been concerned and worked on their concern about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program shares the same goal that the President has, which is to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>I believe that the Chairman and most and hopefully all members of the Senate believe that the optimal way to resolve this challenge is peacefully, through diplomacy -- for two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, because war should always be a last resort, military action should always be a last resort.\xc2\xa0 But two, the way to ensure for the long term that Iran has forsaken its nuclear weapons program and cannot obtain a nuclear weapon is to have Iran agree to forsake it and give it up in a transparent, verifiable way.\xc2\xa0 Because military action would not have the same long-term effect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fear-mongering to say --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the only difference -- the only choices are this interim agreement or a war with Iran?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s why he was saying --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is an interview.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This was an interview?\xc2\xa0 Is that -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, Jon, that our belief is that if sanctions were passed now, even with a delayed trigger, that it would undermine the core sanctions regime and would potentially undermine the negotiations, which, if you want to resolve this peacefully, we need to test whether or not Tehran is willing to do what it takes and to make the commitments necessary to resolve this peacefully.\xc2\xa0 And the only way we can do that is through diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 Because bottom line, this President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is and his position is that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Roger Runningen, and then Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Back to China.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Biden is meeting with Chinese leaders tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Will he make a direct appeal for them to back off or drop their air defense zone?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President has already on this trip and will tomorrow repeat this administration\xe2\x80\x99s position, which I just delivered again moments ago, which is that we do not recognize and believe that China should not implement this ADIZ.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will be a subject of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations.\xc2\xa0 As I noted yesterday, this trip to Japan, China, and the Republic of Korea was long planned and there are a host of items on the agenda in addition to this particular issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what leverage does the U.S. have?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we are making clear our views and our concerns that these kinds of unilateral actions are provocative and create risks of miscalculation, and that miscalculations could undermine peace, security, and prosperity in the region.\xc2\xa0 And it is in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the region to not have peace, prosperity and security put at risk.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be very clear about that, as we have already.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be some consequences for violence?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate or preview conversations the Vice President will have.\xc2\xa0 But our position has been clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other thing -- on the economy, following up on Christie\xe2\x80\x99s questions, is there anything new in the economic speech tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his upcoming push for the Affordable Care Act over the next several weeks, will the President acknowledge the problems that some people have with it in terms of cost or availability?\xc2\xa0 Or will this simply be a propaganda war between the two sides where one side highlights only the losers and the other side only the winners?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I think the President has, over the past several weeks, as have all of us, acknowledged the problems that the rollout of the marketplaces --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And he has acknowledged some of the issues with cancellations and others where problems have been created by this transition period.\xc2\xa0 So our approach has always been to acknowledge those problems and to address them and to fix them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you\'re -- some of your question goes to whether or not -- and this has been a central issue in the debate about whether there should be health insurance reform, whether or not there should be an individual responsibility provision, and obviously we came down on the side of yes, and that if you\'re a 28-year-old and you\'re uninsured and you\'re healthy and you don\'t want to pay for insurance, but you end up in the emergency room, and that\'s the way you get your coverage, that it\xe2\x80\x99s costing you and Jon and Mara and everybody else, and me to pay for that coverage.\xc2\xa0 So that it is the right and responsible thing to do for everyone to avail themselves of affordable, quality health insurance through the marketplaces if they don\'t already have it.</p>\n<p>As you know, because of the way the Affordable Care Act was written, through the expansion of Medicaid, which a number of states have embraced, many uninsured Americans will be able to be covered through Medicaid, and there has been a substantial increase already since October 1st in those states that have expanded Medicaid in the numbers covered by Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 Also, many, many Americans will be able to avail themselves of tax credits, depending on their income, to make sure that the coverage that they choose is affordable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think that the fundamentals of this debate continue.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re focused on is making sure that people know what the benefits are and know what the options they have available to them.\xc2\xa0 Because in spite of all the problems that the misfunctioning website has created, and challenges and obstacles that it has thrown up to the American people over the past several months, we have seen, again, in the last 48 hours, that there is enormous demand and interest in this product.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is because people want the security that health insurance provides.\xc2\xa0 They want the security of a system where they know that they can\'t be jacked around anymore, and that they can have a basic set of benefits that they cannot be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about the website.\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about<br/>\n\t-- I\'m asking whether he will acknowledge complaints --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has acknowledged complaints.\xc2\xa0 He stood up here --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of those who lose coverage --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- before you -- I can\'t remember if you were here, but I\'m sure you watched, that he very clearly acknowledged some of the issues that have arisen with the transition to the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re not shying away from that.\xc2\xa0 But we are also focusing on the many benefits to millions and millions and tens of millions of Americans that the Affordable Care Act provides.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s the focus.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important -- it came up earlier -- that the alternative here has always been nothing.\xc2\xa0 It has always been the status quo.\xc2\xa0 It has always been a situation where more and more people are losing insurance, where costs have been increasing at a far higher rate than inflation, where insurance companies were able to throw you off your policy, or deny you coverage, or carve out exceptions, or give you a low-rate policy that you discover later doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover you for hospitalizations, and that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>So these are the debates that we had around whether or not health insurance reform was the right thing to pursue.\xc2\xa0 It was a hard-fought debate and the law was passed.\xc2\xa0 It was upheld by the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 It was debated extensively, maybe as the principal issue in a presidential election last year.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously created a lot of problems for ourselves because of the website, but we\'re fixing those problems.\xc2\xa0 Because the issue isn\'t can we make the website great; it\xe2\x80\x99s can we make the website effective as a means by which Americans can get what they so clearly have demonstrated an interest in getting.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President going to let Detroit go bankrupt?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think that happened a while ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, a judge today says --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As we said, Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy is something that needs to be resolved between the city and its creditors.\xc2\xa0 What we have said and what we are doing is working to provide real, tangible economic development and opportunity with existing resources and public-private partnerships to support and accelerate Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s revitalization.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President say in the campaign that it would be awful for Detroit to go bankrupt?\xc2\xa0 He obviously helped the auto industry, got them back on their feet.\xc2\xa0 That was a positive development, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.\xc2\xa0 And I thought in the campaign he said it would be horrible for Detroit to go bankrupt.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there is enormous hardship caused by some of the problems that have happened in Detroit, which is why this needs to be resolved between the city and its creditors.\xc2\xa0 Our position on this is the same as it was prior to the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling and prior to -- or in the immediate aftermath of the declaration of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones on health care.\xc2\xa0 As you can imagine, Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s office has been waiting for the President\xe2\x80\x99s event anxiously today, and they put together about a dozen other times the President has launched sort of a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor PR blitz on health care.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s just sort of stuck in the same place and that you\xe2\x80\x99ve made this pitch before and people just are still not buying it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 Because the law passed.\xc2\xa0 The President won reelection.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court upheld it.\xc2\xa0 And a million people showed up on the website yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And guess what -- 380,000 showed up before noon today.\xc2\xa0 And people are enrolling every day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s still trying to sell the benefits.\xc2\xa0 Why is he still selling the benefits?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And Senator McConnell to this day has yet to put on the table a single idea to provide affordable, quality health insurance to the American people.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell, I guess, by highlighting this -- clearly a political thing -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to engage in a debate about whether or not folks who are uninsured ought to have access to quality, affordable health insurance; whether folks who are in states where governors for political reasons chose not to expand Medicaid should have to answer for why their constituents are being denied coverage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why is the President still -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out at the top of the briefing all the great benefits of this.\xc2\xa0 So why does the President still have to sell it?\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s so great, why don\'t people already --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, one reason that we\'ve -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed and covered -- is that we\'ve had a pretty rough go the last couple of months with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been selling the benefits for three years, before the website.\xc2\xa0 You know that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think your questions in many ways mirror what Jim was asking about poll numbers.\xc2\xa0 What we know is that if you ask the American people whether they prefer a world where insurance companies can deny you coverage because you have a preexisting condition, or one in which they are prohibited from denying you coverage because you have a preexisting condition, they prefer overwhelmingly a world where there is a law in place that prevents them from denying you that coverage.\xc2\xa0 And that is true as you go down the list of benefits that the Affordable Care Act provides.</p>\n<p>There is no question -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered it, I\'ve covered attempts to pass health insurance reform in the past.\xc2\xa0 This is a contentious, very political issue here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 But what I can promise you is that around kitchen tables, including in houses where families have tried and struggled with the website in October, including in households where everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s an adult voted against President Obama, people are going to make a decision if they need quality, affordable health insurance and don\xe2\x80\x99t have it, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to look at the options available to them and choose the certainty and security that comes with quality, affordable, private health insurance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go.\xc2\xa0 So Chuck, and then -- April after this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In your response on the Treasury IG report, you said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will have these safeguards in.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Are you guys building new safeguards?\xc2\xa0 Was this the re-phrased -- were you quoting the IRS?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I quoted was the IRS, and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the IRS.\xc2\xa0 The IRS obviously has a certain amount of experience in handling --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So these are all IRS -- this is not something that CMS or HHS should be dealing with and trying to prevent this issue, that it\xe2\x80\x99s all -- the IRS has to deal with this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when it comes to tax fraud and issues of subsidies that are tax related, the IRS handles that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not HHS or the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But is there some way --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So protecting that information --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a better safeguard that HHS should be in the front --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the IG report.\xc2\xa0 I would simply refer you to what, since it\xe2\x80\x99s about the IRS, what the IRS has said in response to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, Consumer Reports, their health care reporter today said their recommendation -- saying they\xe2\x80\x99re now recommending people use the website now.\xc2\xa0 They were not recommending that in October.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying if you started an account in October, you should scrap it and start over.\xc2\xa0 Is that the advice -- is that good advice?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would suggest that that question be addressed to CMS in the briefings they have, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say the wrong thing here on camera.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that CMS is reaching out to consumers who enrolled, and making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the steps they need to take to ensure that that enrollment results in coverage.\xc2\xa0 But specifically about obviously the problems that were had with the website and those issues about people who thought they were enrolled but may not be, I would refer you for the specifics to CMS and in terms of what steps need to be taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I know that when it comes to the 834 forms, when it comes to reaching out, as I said yesterday, to everyone who enrolled to make sure that they are aware of and are in contact with their issuers about when their premiums are due, what other information they may need to provide, that those steps are being taken by CMS, and to make sure that these issues are addressed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to this new push of trying to get people to sign up, is it fair to say we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing the President today if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t confident this website is now functional?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think if the -- how that question plays out.\xc2\xa0 I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You put him out on October 1 before.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t put him out on November 30, December 1, December 2.\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Today is December 3.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my point is, you were waiting to see if traffic was going to work, the enrollment numbers.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the point -- I think it is fair to say that the President is going to acknowledge today and will note today that we have all been -- in the administration, in the Fourth Estate and on Capitol Hill -- focused on the very real problems with the website and other problems with the transition that needed to be addressed and fixed, and that this is an opportunity, now that the website is functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, and we are seeing high volume and high volume being handled effectively by the website, and people enrolling, that it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportune time to talk about, again, the actual benefits that are provided by the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you guys are doing -- it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re leaking enrollment numbers now left and right.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that the first time.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm -- I mean, I tell you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s stuff popping up all over the place now all of a sudden.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I tell you, there are a lot of numbers, and this goes back to the story that was talked about earlier today, that are out there that come from anonymous sources that turn out to be wrong.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not confirming these numbers that are out there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m only -- the numbers I cite --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the traffic and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I have gotten from people who know.\xc2\xa0 We will provide, or HHS and CMS will provide to you the enrollment figures once those that data is scrubbed and everything is received from states, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that those are accurate.\xc2\xa0 That was the case for October; it will be the case for November.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final question on another topic.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some new international test scores that came out where the U.S., particularly in math, ranks 30th -- U.S. teens.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of other countries surpassing the United States, particularly in Asia.\xc2\xa0 Is this a -- how is this not an indictment of No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top when you look at these -- are these programs just simply not working as they were intended if these standardized test scores are as bad as they are for the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right, and Secretary Duncan said today that the assessment demonstrates that there\xe2\x80\x99s too much educational stagnation, even as it shows some encouraging progress on other important measures.\xc2\xa0 And the administration has taken steps to raise standards and improve education for kids across the country, but there is still much more that we need to do.\xc2\xa0 And Congress should pass the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals to, first, make quality early education available to every child; two, redesign America\xe2\x80\x99s high schools to prepare students for college and the workplace; three, make college affordable for everyone who is willing to work for it; and four, to fix, through reauthorization, No Child Left Behind, which goes to one of your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Every state should commit to college and career-ready standards for its students.\xc2\xa0 This is hugely important, and this goes back to the question about the President talking about the economy.\xc2\xa0 This is an economic issue.\xc2\xa0 And it goes to the heart of our economic competitiveness in the future.</p>\n<p>April, I think I gave you the last one.\xc2\xa0 And you guys got to hurry if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 Immigration --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If people are afraid of not making it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with you or around the White House about the deportation hearing this week for his uncle, his father\xe2\x80\x99s half-brother?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that conversation is a legal matter that should be addressed over at the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, has he talked to his uncle recently or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no conversations like that to read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President is well aware that his --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not discussed it with him, so I do not know.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:10 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
