EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to the great state of Texas.\xc2\xa0 I think you understand -- or know the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for the day, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll go right to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been supportive of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s restraint amid pressure from Russia.\xc2\xa0 Now Ukraine is saying that if pro-Russian protestors don\xe2\x80\x99t evacuate some of these government buildings in Eastern Ukraine, Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s government will remove them by force.\xc2\xa0 If the protestors don\xe2\x80\x99t oblige, will the U.S. support Ukraine removing the protestors by force?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Josh, we\xe2\x80\x99re following the situation in Eastern Ukraine very closely.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned about it, and we continue to condemn any violence.\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian authorities continue to act professionally and with restraint.\xc2\xa0 We admire that approach in a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>The Ukrainian government has made clear that it is offering to resolve that situation through dialogue, and we support that approach.\xc2\xa0 As I noted yesterday, there is ample evidence, both in traditional and social media and elsewhere, that some of the protestors are being paid, that they\xe2\x80\x99re not locals, and that is certainly of concern to us.\xc2\xa0 But again, we support the Ukrainian authorities\xe2\x80\x99 approach to this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s paying them, Jay?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s paying them and where are they coming from?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to the reports showing that some of them have been paid.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Russia has not played a helpful role in trying to reduce tensions in Ukraine, but rather, through a variety of actions, has sought to destabilize the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And as Secretary Kerry said yesterday on Capitol Hill, we urge Russia to instead pursue a path of deescalation to withdraw its troops -- or draw down its troops, return them to their pre-crisis positions and numbers; to engage directly with the government of Ukraine; and to allow international monitors to assess on the ground whether or not ethnic Russians are in any way having their rights compromised in parts of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, earlier today, Putin threatened to shut off imports from Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. regard this as a provocative act at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to that report.\xc2\xa0 I would say that, again, we urge Russia to refrain from provocative actions and to instead pursue a path of de-escalation.\xc2\xa0 The cost of further escalation, of further transgressions and provocations I think are clear to the Russians.\xc2\xa0 The authorities exist under the executive orders the President signed to increase sanctions on Russia.\xc2\xa0 The authorities exist to allow the Treasury Department to identify sectors of the Russian economy in which entities and individuals could be sanctioned should the United States make that choice in reaction to further provocations and transgressions by Russia.\xc2\xa0 Those costs are real.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But Russia has an alternative. Foreign Minister Lavrov and Secretary Kerry have been in discussions about moving forward towards a path of de-escalation.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to engage in a dialogue with Russia and our partners on this matter, as well, importantly, as with the Ukrainian government.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Do you think this might be an attempt by Russia to destabilize Ukraine before the main elections?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What might be an attempt?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Blocking of imports.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to that report.\xc2\xa0 I can say that it is clear that Russia has engaged in actions that have as an effect destabilization in Ukraine and presumably a goal of destabilizing Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we saw in Crimea and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we see with the positioning of large numbers of troops on the Ukrainian border and with some of the other actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something we urge the Russians to cease and instead to pursue a path of deescalation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President making any further calls about this to Putin, European leaders, Ukrainians?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Peter, the President has been engaged with our partners and allies on this issue since the crisis began and has had a number of conversations, lengthy conversations with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new calls to report to you, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you apprised if there are some that we can read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there meetings, regular meetings?\xc2\xa0 Is he having briefings on this beyond the normal, daily PDB kind of briefing?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are as a rule, within the -- on the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team, meetings on this subject, as well as others that are top of the agenda, and the President is regularly briefed on developments in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific meetings involving the President to read out.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine was of course one of the subjects discussed in the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Secretary Kerry that the Vice President joined yesterday, I believe it was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President -- has he been briefed on the school stabbing incident this morning in Pennsylvania?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information about that incident?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I only have information that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in media reports.\xc2\xa0 The President is aware of it, but I would refer you at this point to local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this is the second time that the President has gone to Fort Hood after a mass shooting.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what he thinks can and should be done that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already been done to eliminate the possibilities of these kind of events, and what he thinks in particular of suggestions that more military personnel should be allowed to go armed on military installations.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the Defense Department has spoken on that issue.\xc2\xa0 The President described accurately this event as heartbreaking.\xc2\xa0 And he is deeply saddened by the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s making a trip to Fort Hood again for a memorial ceremony.\xc2\xa0 He will meet with families of the deceased, as well as of the wounded, and offer whatever comfort he can.\xc2\xa0 He will be joined by the First Lady, as you know.</p>\n<p>On the broader issues of gun violence, you know the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 You know the efforts that he\xe2\x80\x99s undertaken.\xc2\xa0 You know the disappointment he felt when the Congress failed to heed the desires of an overwhelming majority of the American people and refuse to pass a commonsense measure to expand background checks.\xc2\xa0 But he has committed to take actions that he can that were outlined in his plan to reduce gun violence, the actions that he can take through his executive -- using his executive authorities.\xc2\xa0 And he has followed through on every one of those, as well as some others.\xc2\xa0 So that effort continues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on the idea of letting military personnel carry guns on bases, is he for that or against that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the Defense Department -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Department has spoken to this, and I would refer you to what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President satisfied with the actions taken by Director Pierson to sort of address the situation that continues to pop up with the Secret Service?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has full confidence in Director Pierson and supports the approach she\xe2\x80\x99s taken as a general proposition in having zero tolerance for misconduct of this nature.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about the specific actions that were reported today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 These aggressions that you see Russia taking, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re covert or whatever, are they moving closer to more sanctions coming down the line from the U.S., from allies?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the trigger mechanism that we see more sanctions now against Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are, as we assess the situation in Ukraine on the ground, reviewing the authorities that permit the United States to impose sanctions.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said a few times I think this week, under the authorities, the United States has already imposed sanctions in response to actions taken by Russia and others with regards to Crimea.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly remains possible that further sanctions could be coming in response directly to the action in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to always emphasize that, and not say that any new sanctions would only be related to new provocations, because the authorities remain open and available with regards to the actions in Crimea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As for further provocations and transgressions, we are assessing what we are seeing on the ground and what the Russians are doing and not doing in that regard.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly let you know if we take further action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are further sanctions imminent, would you say, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize that, Steve.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing it.\xc2\xa0 We have significant concerns, as Secretary Kerry said yesterday, about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions that serve to at least attempt to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an approach that is counterproductive, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you talk about the speech tomorrow a little bit?\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to accomplish with this speech at the Civil Rights Summit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without previewing the speech, which the President is still working on and which he looks forward to delivering, I would say that President Obama has deep appreciation for the effort that went into passing landmark civil rights legislation -- an effort led by President Johnson, and a successful effort that will be forever to President Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s credit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it\'s fair to say there is a connection between the passing of that legislation, and the fact that Barack Obama is President of the United States says a lot about America.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo he looks forward to it.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, I won\xe2\x80\x99t characterize his remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he impatient with Congress for failing to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Never.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- come up with a new formula to replace the one the Supreme Court struck down on the Voting Rights Act?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President appreciates that there is a bipartisan effort underway to work on this issue, and that is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t assessed his level of patience.\xc2\xa0 I know that he believes Congress needs to address this, and he\xe2\x80\x99s heartened by the fact that this is a bipartisan effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the Friday trip to New York and speaking at Reverend Sharpton\xe2\x80\x99s organization, is there any second thoughts given the reports about his involvement with the FBI and the mafia just in terms of timing and awkwardness?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Reverend Sharpton and the National Action Network have made significant contributions to civil rights efforts, and the President looks forward to appearing at the conference.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this his first time at that conference?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him at least once when he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken to the group.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Secretary Jeh Johnson is meeting today with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about their ideas for reforming deportation.\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline for action on that?\xc2\xa0 And if Speaker Boehner indicates he won\xe2\x80\x99t move on anything before the recess, will this administration act by itself?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the matter of Secretary Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s review, I would refer you to DHS.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Obama asked for that review, so --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He sure did, yes.\xc2\xa0 And he has great confidence in Secretary Johnson to conduct a thorough review and to do it expeditiously.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a timeframe to attach to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes there remains an opportunity for House Republicans and the House Republican leadership -- not just Speaker Boehner, but Leader Cantor, Congressman McCarthy -- to do the right thing for the country, for the economy, for our security and for the Republican Party, and to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what might happen if they fail to take action, because the President is hopeful that they will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as we head to fundraisers this evening, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s, just generally speaking, level of confidence heading into the midterms for particularly Senate Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 For specifics, I\xe2\x80\x99d obviously refer you to the DNC or the party committees.\xc2\xa0 But the President is very pleased to be assisting Democrats running in this election cycle.\xc2\xa0 He believes that he and they have an agenda that is broadly supported by middle-class Americans across the country in all of the states where there are competitive elections.</p>\n<p>And I think if you look at the debate just this week, the distinction that we see is one that highlights how President Obama and Democrats are working on behalf of Americans, and in this case women, to expand opportunity and ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s a level playing field when it comes to opportunities in the workforce.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I have honestly been surprised a little bit by the fact that Republican leaders seem to proudly tout their opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act, proudly tout their opposition to every action that this President and previous Presidents and Democrats in Congress have taken to support paycheck fairness and pay equity and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights in the past.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how they think that\xe2\x80\x99s good politics.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not good policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s his level of confidence that this message is getting across to voters?\xc2\xa0 Does he think that the Senate -- that the Democrats are going to be able to hold the Senate, win back the House?\xc2\xa0 What are his expectations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He and we are confident that the Senate will retain -- that Democrats, rather, will take control of the Senate because of the policy agenda that Democrats support and are actively working on.\xc2\xa0 And he believes Democrats will do well in House races as well.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, for specifics about race-by-race analysis, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the committees.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to cross paths with any other Presidents in the next two days?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to see Bush, the elder, in Houston or see any of the other Presidents at the LBJ event?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I know that when it comes to those former Presidents who are speaking, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s staggered in a way that -- I know that President Carter has already spoken and I believe President George W. Bush is speaking tomorrow evening after the President.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that means in terms of any encounters President Obama might have with any of his predecessors.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get an answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I know he would enjoy it as he did at the opening of the George W. Bush Library, and he certainly enjoyed the many hours he spent with President Bush 43 and First Lady Laura Bush on that trip for Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s funeral.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he commented on the paintings yet?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has.\xc2\xa0 I have.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think you and I have both covered President Bush.\xc2\xa0 At least I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak for myself -- are both surprised and impressed by the pursuit that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken up and the clear dedication he has given it.\xc2\xa0 So I know when he was onboard Air Force One with President Obama and Secretary Clinton that he showed the President and the First Lady and Secretary Clinton some of his paintings on his iPad and I think everybody was impressed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama going to pick up the hobby himself?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama going to follow suit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eisenhower painted in the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- close to three years remaining in the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term, so he\xe2\x80\x99s got his hands full at the moment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he want Bush to do a portrait of him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that would be up to President Bush.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they had that discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s at the LBJ Library, will he be looking with an eye towards what his own library should look like?\xc2\xa0 Is he looking for ideas?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President will be focused on the meaning of the event, the significance of the anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act.\xc2\xa0 I think that will be his focus.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he having meetings with John Lewis or any of the other civil rights figures who will be there?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything on the agenda other than the speech?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, Peter.\xc2\xa0 If we have more details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule that we can provide, we will.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything the First Lady is doing independently of her husband that we should know about?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:30 A.M.
