EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s Friday. \xc2\xa0Cheer up, everybody. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of news to report. \xc2\xa0Plenty of news to report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re in good cheer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I am, I am. \xc2\xa0Let me explain to you why. \xc2\xa0Two reasons. \xc2\xa0The first is, today we were pleased to see a bipartisan majority come together in the House of Representatives to support trade promotion authority, and there were many people in this room rightly skeptical, as recently as two or three months ago, about whether or not Democrats and Republicans would be able to come together on such a significant legislative priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s, but also on a policy issue that I think everybody acknowledges is really complicated and politically fraught.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously gratified that we were able to advance that piece of legislation with bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0I would also note that we had 28 House Democrats who voted for that bill. \xc2\xa0That significantly over-performs expectations. \xc2\xa0Again, there was a lot of skepticism about how much Democratic support the President would succeed in building. \xc2\xa0And getting the support of 28 House Democrats is a good sign of the kind of bipartisan majority that the President was seeking to build. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, at the same time, as many of you have also written about already, I also feel a little like Yogi Berra. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m tempted to walk out here and say it\xe2\x80\x99s d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu all over again. \xc2\xa0Many of you who are frequent visitors of this briefing room will recall back on May 12th I walked out here prepared to answer your questions about how the Democratic Leader of body of Congress had handed the President a substantial legislative defeat on a significant policy priority that the President had identified. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m walking out here on June 12th prepared to answer your questions about your perception that the Democratic Leader of a body of Congress has handed the President a legislative defeat on a priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0At the time, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that I colorfully described the situation as a legislative procedural snafu. \xc2\xa0And to the surprise of very few, another procedural snafu has emerged. \xc2\xa0These kinds of entanglements are endemic to the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0And I say that as somebody who does not have a lot of experience in watching the floor of the House. \xc2\xa0But the President is determined -- and I think as was evident from his visit to Capitol Hill this morning -- to build a bipartisan majority to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re living up to our commitment as Democrats to fight for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason the President is in this office.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs the President pointed out rather forcefully in the Democratic caucus today, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t elected by the Chamber of Commerce; he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t endorsed by the NFIB. \xc2\xa0The President is the President of the United States today because of his commitment to fight for working families and to expand the economic opportunity for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason he got this job in the first place. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason he was reelected into this office three years ago. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to keep at the top of his agenda for the next 18 months.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to walk the walk when it comes to those progressive values, then it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be important for Democrats and Republicans to come together around trade adjustment assistance. \xc2\xa0This is a program that will lapse on September 30th. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem because Republicans have traditionally opposed trade adjustment assistance, and, as everybody knows, Republicans enjoy significant majorities in both the House and the Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if Democrats want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking out for the interest of middle-class families, we need to make sure that trade adjustment assistance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lapse. \xc2\xa0The good news is we\xe2\x80\x99re not just going to extend the program, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to significantly expand it. \xc2\xa0The proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s before the House right now would nearly double that program in size. \xc2\xa0And according to an analysis that\xe2\x80\x99s been put out by the White House today, this is actually a program that will benefit 100,000 American workers each year for the next six years. \xc2\xa0That is a substantial benefit to middle-class families that are willing to go and make sure that they can get the training and skills that they need to go and compete for good middle-class jobs. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s always been at the top of the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic policymaking agenda. \xc2\xa0It is today. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make that case in the House to build a bipartisan majority in the House for that legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat was a slightly longer windup than I intended. \xc2\xa0But why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go to your questions now. \xc2\xa0Nedra, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Since you brought her up, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Leader Pelosi. \xc2\xa0How disappointed is the President that she turned against this legislation after remaining uncommitted for so long, after he made a personal appeal to her? \xc2\xa0What happened there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has enjoyed a very long, warm, productive relationship with Nancy Pelosi. \xc2\xa0As the Speaker of the House, she helped shepherd in one of the most substantial, progressive legislative agendas in history. \xc2\xa0That on her watch, working closely with President Obama, we prevented a second Great Depression; we reformed the health care system in a way that has -- the benefits of which are becoming clearer every day and bigger every day. \xc2\xa0She presided over a House of Representatives that voted to reform Wall Street to make sure that taxpayers would not be on the hook for bailing out big banks that make risky bets. \xc2\xa0She worked legislatively with the administration to end "don\'t ask, don\'t tell." \xc2\xa0And these are all achievements that the President is quite proud of -- legislative achievements that required the skillful leadership of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSince that time, there have been other important -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been additional important progress on other priorities the President has identified -- from the fiscal cliff and making sure that those at the top of the income scale were paying their fair share, to protecting the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anybody wants to talk about the Iran negotiations today, but if they do, one of my points of emphasis will be to remind you that because of a letter that was written and signed by just about every Democrat in the House of Representatives, the President feels confident that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to use diplomacy to prevent Iran from obtaining and nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0There has been an active effort by some in Congress to try to interfere with that ability. \xc2\xa0But because House Democrats have signaled that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to stand strong with the President, we think we can accomplish that goal. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s suggested that that priority is going to be threatened just because we might have a disagreement over this particular issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make an aggressive case to all the House Democrats, including Leader Pelosi, about why it\xe2\x80\x99s important for them to support trade adjustment assistance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given the resounding defeat today on trade assistance, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President going to do to try to turn that around with the next vote?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has spent a lot of time talking to members of Congress about these issues being a priority. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, as I mentioned at the top, making sure that workers have access to trade adjustment assistance is a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0The truth is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a top priority of every Democrat too. \xc2\xa0The last time that it was on the floor of the House of Representatives, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a situation that many Democrats voted for it. \xc2\xa0Every Democrat voted for it, including 125 members of Congress -- Democrats -- who are still in office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as I mentioned earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting that they should merely renew what they voted for three years ago. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting -- or four years ago. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that they should actually support a legislative package that would significantly enhance it. \xc2\xa0It would almost double the size of the cap, freeing up additional funds to help workers. \xc2\xa0It would allow 17,000 workers, who over the last 18 months have had their eligibility for trade adjustment assistance denied, to allow them to have their applications reconsidered again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that\'s an indication that this particular program can do a lot for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And we know that there are a lot of Democrats in the House of Representatives who ran for that job specifically to benefit middle-class families and to make sure that they had a voice and somebody fighting for them in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we feel like we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong case to make in terms of trying to build a bipartisan majority for trade adjustment assistance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The voting today was a little confusing, so if you could help us out a little bit on what happens if TAA can\'t pass. \xc2\xa0Does the Senate get back involved? \xc2\xa0Or what does the strategy become then?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this will be the subject of a lot of conversations between White House officials and maybe even the President today and over the weekend, and possibly even into early next week. \xc2\xa0So figuring out the legislative procedure and the path forward will principally be the responsibility of members of the legislature.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the White House, as we have been in the past, will certainly be involved in those conversations because this is a priority that the President has identified.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Julia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Is the President concerned that his meeting with Democrats on the Hill this morning backfired in any way? \xc2\xa0Some Democrats leaving that meeting said they felt insulted, said that the President tried to impugn their integrity when he told them to \xe2\x80\x9cplay it straight\xe2\x80\x9d on the TAA vote. \xc2\xa0Is he worried that he may have frayed relations going into what might be another vote on TAA next week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not at all. \xc2\xa0The President had a productive visit with the House Democratic caucus today. \xc2\xa0And he delivered a very strong case about helping those members of Congress understand precisely why he was strongly supportive of making sure that we are expanding economic opportunity for every American by opening up access to overseas markets for American goods and services.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He explained how, as a young man, he left New York and traveled to the South Side of Chicago where he tried to help a community deal with the closing of steel plants. \xc2\xa0And he talked about all the work that he\xe2\x80\x99d done in the community there to try to help that community confront the powerful forces of globalization. \xc2\xa0He went on to talk about how, as a candidate for the United States Senate, he traveled to Galesburg, Illinois with then-Congressman -- Democratic Congressman Lane Evans. \xc2\xa0And while in Galesburg, the President spent a lot of time with citizens in that community who are dealing with the closure of the Maytag plant there. \xc2\xa0That\'s a plant that moved to Mexico. \xc2\xa0And he talked about the impact that that had on the community and on middle-class families in that community.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President said that he ran for this office determined to go and fight for the people that he fought for as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, and determined to fight for the people that he met in Galesburg, Illinois.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And this strategy of passing the most progressive trade promotion authority bill that\'s ever been considered by the Congress is an important part of that strategy. \xc2\xa0It doesn\'t, however, eliminate the need for Congress to make progress on the wide variety of other economic priorities the President has identified, from raising the minimum wage, to passing early childhood education, to investing in infrastructure, to getting immigration reform done. \xc2\xa0Those are all -- those all continue to be important priorities because they will also benefit middle-class families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President is confident that he continues to have loyal partners in the Democratic caucus when it comes to those issues. \xc2\xa0But the fact is we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen cooperation from Republicans on those priorities, but on this one we have. \xc2\xa0And the President strongly encouraged Democrats to make up their own mind, and when they did, to play it straight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Actually stepping away from trade quickly, Secretary Kerry was released from the hospital today and went home to his home in Boston. \xc2\xa0Do you have any updates on when Secretary Kerry is expected to come to Washington, and whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s still expected to participate in talks over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear capabilities by the end of the month?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0You can check with the State Department; they may have some more details. \xc2\xa0Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased to see that Secretary Kerry is slated to be discharged from the hospital today, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been already. \xc2\xa0I think that is an indication that he is living up to his reputation as someone who is determined to get back into his office and determined to get back on the job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd Secretary Kerry is tough. \xc2\xa0The truth is, he probably benefitted from a little rest when he was in the hospital; he\xe2\x80\x99s been working himself so hard over the last several weeks. \xc2\xa0And I think he, more than anybody, understands the long list of priorities that are awaiting when he gets back to his desk, and we certainly are looking forward to him getting back on the job and wish him very well as he continues to recover from surgery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But no contingency plans at this point about sending someone in his place or possibly changing the location of the talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nothing at this point. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear exactly whether or not that will be necessary, but additional scheduling updates will come from the State Department.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you came out with that Midwest optimism, but in reality, when you look at it, was it really a good day for the President? \xc2\xa0He does not have anything on his desk to sign, and he has an uphill battle -- has to get two votes on Tuesday to get something to his desk, is my understanding. \xc2\xa0And the vote today was overwhelming. \xc2\xa0It was an overwhelming defeat by his own party. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t your optimism a little misplaced?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Jim, primarily because there was a lot of healthy, well-informed skepticism about the ability of the United States Congress to work in bipartisan fashion to pass something like trade promotion authority that is so complicated and so fraught with a lot of toxic politics. \xc2\xa0And based on a lot of good work in the Senate and some bipartisan work in the House, those odds were overcome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really pass it, Josh.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, sure they did. \xc2\xa0They did with 28 Democratic votes, and TPA has passed. \xc2\xa0That was actually going to be the hard one. \xc2\xa0The broad assumption in here I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for all of you; I\xe2\x80\x99ve done that three or four times today -- but I think many people, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re in here or not, assumed that it would be easier to pass trade adjustment assistance than it would be to pass trade promotion authority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the fact is the hard part has gotten done. \xc2\xa0When it comes to making the case to Democrats about why they should support trade adjustment assistance, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a really strong case to make. \xc2\xa0If they don\xe2\x80\x99t act on it as early as next week, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to expire at the end of September. \xc2\xa0This is a program that Democrats believe in; they unanimously supported it last time it was on the floor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong case to make here because we\xe2\x80\x99re not just talking about preventing this program from lapsing, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about significantly expanding it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the opponents of the trade fast track bill did what they wanted to do, which was undercut it by defeating the trade assistance bill. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what they designed -- was designed to happen, and it happened.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what they designed -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what they tried to do in the United States Senate, and there was at one point in time a procedural snafu that prompted a delay. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a similar dynamic in the House right now. \xc2\xa0In some ways, the one in the House is actually easier to resolve -- again, because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a piece of legislation that the last time it was voted on got the unanimous support of Democrats.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there are a substantial number of Republicans that voted for it today. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the ability of the Speaker of the House to convince even more Republicans to vote for trade adjustment assistance. \xc2\xa0We certainly believe that we can convince more Democrats to vote for a program that many of them have previously supported, and that our economists can demonstrate significantly benefit middle-class families all across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My colleague asked you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Leader Pelosi going against the President today. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about what it felt like to have John Boehner bail out the President today with procedural moves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I would characterize it that way. \xc2\xa0I think that what you have seen over the last -- certainly over the last week, and the ground work has been laid in recent months, [is] effective coordination between the White House and the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office to make progress on a shared priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is the kind of bipartisan effort that the President has long envisioned. \xc2\xa0And unfortunately, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen nearly enough of it, but in this case you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give some credit where it\xe2\x80\x99s due -- to the Speaker of the House, who, despite his many ideological differences with the President, has said let\xe2\x80\x99s put aside our differences and figure out how we can work together to build a bipartisan majority for a policy that we both believe will benefit our economy and will benefit middle-class families across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the irony here, with Pelosi on one side, and Boehner on the other side with the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I see is I see that there is a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives that\xe2\x80\x99s standing with the President. \xc2\xa0Yes, that means a substantial number of Republicans. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership ability too, that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to set aside his own differences with them to try to find common ground on this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, I think the country is very well served by that kind of bipartisan spirit, and hopefully this will serve as a template not just for eventually passing trade adjustment assistance, but also making progress on some other bipartisan priorities that have been identified, including investments in infrastructure, criminal justice reform and some other things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So help me understand then -- as I understand it, many of the Democrats that opposed the TAA today did so -- and I think the former Speaker said this in her final remarks as well -- they did so as a way of stopping TPA, which they don\xe2\x80\x99t like. \xc2\xa0So if TPA has now passed with 219, and so the only thing standing in the way of TPA from actually getting to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk is now keeping TAA dead, don\xe2\x80\x99t those Democrats all have even more incentive to continue to be opposed to it next week, if you guys bring it up again, than they do now? \xc2\xa0So you have a bigger hill to climb. \xc2\xa0I mean, how can you possibly say that you are going to convince more Democrats to vote for it now when it\xe2\x80\x99s even more important for them to remain opposed to it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, because the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make to them, Mike, is that they may have -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve registered their objections with TPA. \xc2\xa0They hoped to block the passage of TPA, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. \xc2\xa0TPA did pass with a bipartisan majority. \xc2\xa0And now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go and make the case to them that they should support a policy that they have strongly supported in the past. \xc2\xa0And in fact, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see that policy that they strongly support lapse. \xc2\xa0Instead, they actually had the opportunity not just to make sure that -- not just to prevent its lapse, but actually to significantly expand it -- almost double it in size when it comes to the amount of money that can be spent on job training programs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But then that means caving on their bigger goal, which is keeping TPA from going forward, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the TPA has already passed. \xc2\xa0And so now they have a question about are they going to support a policy that previously earned the unanimous support of Democrats, and are they going to seek to expand it and make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position where they\xe2\x80\x99re essentially -- make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re in a position where they can offer support to those workers that are dealing with the challenges of globalization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But if TAA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass, then TPA is dead, right? \xc2\xa0I mean, if ultimately you can\xe2\x80\x99t get it passed, it\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s true is the President shares -- I mean, look, this is true. \xc2\xa0The President agrees with Democrats that TAA is a priority. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing here. \xc2\xa0I would acknowledge that there are some differences of opinion, but there are far more areas where we agree than where we disagree. \xc2\xa0And I think this is the hallmark of a legislative procedural snafu. \xc2\xa0I think we know it when we see it now. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And clearly, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have before us today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, Jim.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So to quote Yogi Berra, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s not over till it\xe2\x80\x99s over\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We can do a lot of that today, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t we?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But to Mike\xe2\x80\x99s point, I just want to put a fine point on this. \xc2\xa0The President will not sign TPA without TAA?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has made clear -- the President has made clear that trade adjustment assistance is a strong priority, and that if we are going to take steps that the President believes is good for our economy and good for middle-class families to expand access to overseas markets, that one thing we also need to do is make a similar investment in those workers who are negatively affected by broader trends -- by broader globalization trends.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what we know is we actually know how to do this now. \xc2\xa0And this is the thing that Secretary Perez wrote to members of Congress yesterday. \xc2\xa0He wrote a long letter, and I can get you a copy of that letter if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to see it. \xc2\xa0But essentially described what the benefits are of this trade adjustment assistance proposal. \xc2\xa0This is essentially a package of job training grants, and other funding that allows workers who can successfully petition to the Department of Labor to get access to job training programs that will ensure that they get the skills they need to actually get another job.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So this package is a very -- is a significant one. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a significant expansion of the package that\xe2\x80\x99s poised to expire at the end of September. \xc2\xa0This will expand -- make trade adjustment assistance available for six years. \xc2\xa0It would nearly double the program in size. \xc2\xa0It would allow 17,500 workers, who over the last 18 months have had their eligibility denied, to allow them to have their applications reconsidered. \xc2\xa0And it would provide -- make available to workers 130 weeks of what\xe2\x80\x99s called trade readjustment allowance benefits. \xc2\xa0Essentially, that means -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re doing the math -- that means that that is enough assistance to go through a two-year training program; to go and get some really good skills that you know you can then use to go and get a good middle-class job.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So these kinds of programs we know make a real difference in the lives of middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make to Democrats. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- this is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But no TPA without TAA? \xc2\xa0I mean, just --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is not a situation where we have to persuade Democrats to hold their nose and vote for something. \xc2\xa0This is an opportunity for Democrats to support the expansion of a program that they previously have indicated they strongly support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a non-answer. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re answering that question.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to give a non-answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the President will not sign TPA without TAA? \xc2\xa0Both of these have to be passed and packaged together, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as a matter of legislative procedure, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. \xc2\xa0The House of Representatives can\xe2\x80\x99t just send -- based on their vote today -- they can\xe2\x80\x99t just send the TPA bill to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk and hope that the TAA bill follows. \xc2\xa0Procedurally that won\xe2\x80\x99t work. \xc2\xa0Again, this is why I would describe this as procedural snafu. \xc2\xa0We have a situation where we have got a clear bipartisan majority in the House; we just have to work our way through the procedures so that it can make its way to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And why did the President wait until the last minute to go up to Capitol Hill, to go schmooze lawmakers at the congressional baseball game last night? \xc2\xa0And what do you say to people in this town who believe that\xe2\x80\x99s just too little too late?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If that were all the President did, I would agree with them. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, the President held -- the President personally had dozens of conversations with Democrats in the House and in the Senate to make the case for this proposal. \xc2\xa0And those are conversations that took place over the course of months.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOften, in the course of the skeptical questions about whether trade could ever get done in the Congress, people would ask, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President trying to do to get it passed?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And I made reference to the fact that the President was regularly engaged in conversations. \xc2\xa0And that typically was small meetings that the President would convene with three or four members, sometimes in the private dining room off the Oval Office having these conversations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Meetings we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about that weren\xe2\x80\x99t read out to us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right, that weren\xe2\x80\x99t previously announced.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why weren\xe2\x80\x99t those announced? \xc2\xa0Why not tell the public that he\xe2\x80\x99s having these meetings?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, because the President wanted to have an opportunity to have a private conversation with them. \xc2\xa0And I think were some members of Congress who did come out and say that they had had conversations with the President about this. \xc2\xa0That was often in the context of announcing their support for the bill. \xc2\xa0There are other more high-profile settings where you saw the President make his case. \xc2\xa0For example, there were four members of Congress who flew with the President to Germany when he took his trip to the G7 just last weekend. \xc2\xa0It seems like a month ago.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But to jump ahead, when you see stories written over the next 48 hours that say that this vote that occurred on Friday contributed to the President\xe2\x80\x99s lame duck status; when White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest is quoted in those stories, he says what?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He says the President successfully -- (laughter) -- is it awkward for me to refer to myself in the third person? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I would do is I would simply observe that there is healthy skepticism across the United States Capitol, and across the country, about whether or not Democrats and Republicans would actually be able to work together in bipartisan fashion to pass Trade Promotion Authority. \xc2\xa0And because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and because of the effective leadership of Republicans on the other side of the aisle that were willing to coordinate and cooperate with the President and his team, the President succeeded in that priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is still a procedural snafu to work through, but that\xe2\x80\x99s in the same spirit that has contributed to our success in passing TPA through the Senate, TAA through the Senate, TPA through the House. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to use the same strategy to pass TAA through the House, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, when it comes to TAA and even TPP, many Democrats felt it was really a matter of survival for many middle-income Americans who could lose their jobs to globalization. \xc2\xa0What do you say about the issue of survival as you\'re trying to marry this globalization in trade with people that you\'re wanting to enhance TAA in case there is a job loss for some of these people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And this was the nature -- this was a significant part of the presentation that the President made to House Democrats today. \xc2\xa0It is impossible to completely insulate the United States of America and the American people from the broader economic forces of globalization. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just impossible to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so the question is: \xc2\xa0How are the leaders of this country going to prepare our economy and the American people to weather those forces? \xc2\xa0There are some who advocate trying to shut the United States out from the rest of the world. \xc2\xa0The President has zero confidence in that strategy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President believes that our economy and our people are best served if we actually try to engage the world, and engage the world in a way where we enter into agreements whereby they commit to respecting basic intellectual property laws, raising labor standards, adopting higher environmental standards, respecting and protecting basic human rights. \xc2\xa0That if we can get them to commit to doing all of that in exchange for doing business in the United States, well, what the United States is essentially doing is leveling the playing field, and we can go do business in all those countries, too. \xc2\xa0And when I say all those countries, we\'re talking about some of the most economically dynamic countries in the world. \xc2\xa0These are the countries that have some of the fastest-growing economies on the plant.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And giving American businesses and American workers the opportunity to do business in those countries with the more level playing field is tremendous opportunity. \xc2\xa0And that is the right way for us to respond to the challenging forces of a globalized economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When you say that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to insulate the American people from this globalization in trade deal that you\'re doing, when you\'re in their rooms calculating the positives and the negatives, realistically what is this White House expecting when the trade bill goes through -- the numbers of jobs and the numbers of people who could lose their jobs because of globalization over the next six years, as you said, with TAA?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You mean how soon do we expect this legislation to pass? \xc2\xa0Is that what you\'re asking?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- no. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking realistically, in numbers, when you calculate the positives of TPA and the losses of globalization, realistically over the next six years, when you have this trajectory if TAA were to come to place, how many people realistically in this nation are you looking at that could realistically not be insulated, lose their jobs because of TPA?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me see if we can get you some economic analysis from the CEA. \xc2\xa0What I would merely say to you is that the United States, our economy and our people will be much worse off if we just lock in the status quo, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. \xc2\xa0The President believes -- and there is some evidence to back this up -- that if we do enter into these trade agreements that seek to level the playing field with other countries, particularly those countries in the most economically vibrant regions in the world, that that will create jobs right here in the United States. \xc2\xa0That was the reason the President traveled to the Nike headquarter six or eight weeks ago -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Nike said.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNike is a company with a history of investing in other countries, taking advantage of the economic opportunity that exists in other countries. \xc2\xa0And what Nike said was they said, if you pass this TPP deal and we get other countries to start to raise their labor standards and raise their environmental standards, and respect basic intellectual property rights, that what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is we\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to invest in creating jobs right here in America. \xc2\xa0Because we know, right here in America, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best workers. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best colleges and universities. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the most clever innovators. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the most ambitious entrepreneurs. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an environment that Nike wants to be a part of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo they recognize that, by engaging in the world, we can actually expand economic opportunity right here at home.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And on another subject -- Cleveland. \xc2\xa0The judge finds that the police officers who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice, there is cause for murder charges. \xc2\xa0What does the White House feel about that after we watched this -- after the situation in Ferguson and in New York, and then there was Cleveland? \xc2\xa0What do you say to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding at this point, April, is that this is a case that\xe2\x80\x99s now in the hands of a local prosecutor. \xc2\xa0And that local prosecutor will take a look at the facts. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that individual will consider the ruling of the judge. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, this is a decision for the federal prosecutor -- for the local prosecutor to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Department of Justice has obviously been engaged with the city of Cleveland to help them implement some of the reforms that they felt were needed there. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to the specific case, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any direct comment on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did Leader Pelosi tell President Obama that she was not going to support TAA before she went to the House floor?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kristen, what I will tell you is that prior to addressing the House Democratic caucus on Capitol Hill today, the President did have an opportunity to huddle with the House Democratic leaders, not just Leader Pelosi, but with the other members of the Democratic leadership. \xc2\xa0They had a private conversation before the President addressed the broader Democratic caucus. \xc2\xa0And that was a private conversation that they had, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to talk about the details of that conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But just to clarify, was it his impression, based on that meeting, that Leader Pelosi was not going to support TAA? \xc2\xa0Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that they had an opportunity to discuss this at some length this morning, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to talk about the details of that conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And was he anticipating that he was going to support it leaving that meeting? \xc2\xa0We saw them come out. \xc2\xa0They seemed to be all smiles. \xc2\xa0What was his impression leaving that meeting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the reason they\xe2\x80\x99re all smiles is because that have a warm, constructive relationship that has yielded a lot of benefits for the American people. \xc2\xa0And there is so much of what the President has accomplished that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been possible without somebody like Leader Pelosi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of their conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me put it this way: \xc2\xa0Was he surprised by Leader Pelosi going out on the floor and opposing TAA?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President watched her specific floor speech. \xc2\xa0The President had an opportunity to speak to her before the caucus meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he watch the vote?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he did. \xc2\xa0He certainly is aware of it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You described his relationship with --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At the risk of underplaying it, he\xe2\x80\x99s -- (laughter).<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re describing his relationship with Democratic lawmakers as warm and constructive. \xc2\xa0I have to go back to this question and the perception that some of them had coming out of that meeting. \xc2\xa0Congressman DeFazio -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to read you his exact quote. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe President tried to both guilt people and then impugn their integrity, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a very effective tactic.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I know you were arguing just the opposite, that you felt as though the President\xe2\x80\x99s tactic was effective. \xc2\xa0But clearly his message didn\xe2\x80\x99t get through. \xc2\xa0Does he need to change his strategy and his message?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Now, Kristen, consider we succeeded in passing TPA through the United States Senate with bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0We succeeded in passing TAA through the Senate with strong bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0We succeeded in passing TPA through the House with strong bipartisan support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, ultimately, today you failed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear indication to me that our strategy is clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Overall, you failed, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t win today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kristen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\xe2\x80\x99s an accurate assessment of what happened. \xc2\xa0The fact is, six months ago, and I think even in the last couple of months, we could find questions from you, asking skeptically -- and rightfully so -- about the capacity of the United States Congress and the ability of the President to work with Republicans in the Congress to try to pass TPA. \xc2\xa0And yet that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happened today. \xc2\xa0There were also some skeptical questions about how much Democratic support the President would be able to build for this priority; that there are some who are saying, well, are you going to call it a win if you can only 15 or 18 Democrats? \xc2\xa0We got 28 Democrats to support it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo from that standpoint, I think that is -- I think if you consider the results, that\xe2\x80\x99s a strong endorsement of our strategy. \xc2\xa0But clearly, what I would concede is that our work is not done yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you worry that his message is not getting through when you hear that type of feedback from Democrats?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And more broadly, just to follow up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, he asked is this too little too late. \xc2\xa0Some Democrat lawmakers say if the President had begun to foster relations with them years ago, that he would have had more success on a key piece of legislation that he\xe2\x80\x99s fighting so hard for. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I find it hard to believe that the President\xe2\x80\x99s attendance at the 2014 congressional baseball game would have in any way contributed to the vote count today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, Josh, not just the 2014 baseball game --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the prospect that some have raised, right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- but having more outreach on a more consistent basis --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the prospect that some have raised -- that, oh, if the President had just gone to the congressional baseball game before, that this kind of thing wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But having a more robust outreach on a more consistent basis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0To be honest with you, Kristen, I think that the President takes much more seriously members of Congress and their concerns than some people -- than some analysts do when they\xe2\x80\x99re considering how they make decisions about significant policy issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, did the White House know in advance that there would be a vote on TPA even though TAA was defeated?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is I think there was some indication that that was a possibility today. \xc2\xa0But I think, again, just in the short period of time that I have been observing activity on the floor of the House of Representatives, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen until it happens. \xc2\xa0But there was some indication, based on private conversations we\xe2\x80\x99d had with Republican leaders, that that was a possibility.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, since TAA was defeated, were you surprised that TPA was passed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be blunt, no. \xc2\xa0There was confidence that there was a bipartisan majority that had been built to pass TPA through the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And at last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, did the President actually bring up trade in glad-handing members of Congress on the field?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t overhear any of the conversations that he may have had with members on the field. \xc2\xa0I think mostly they were there to have a good time. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he had a chance to twist any arms, but, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good illustration that goes back to what Kristen was asking. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there were any members of Congress who would say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to National\xe2\x80\x99s Park last night changed their vote on this issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was already a lid for the day when it was announced, or it was hinted that the President was going to the game. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us how he decided, you know, I ought to go to the game?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President did view it as an opportunity to get out of the White House, which is something that he looks for the chance to do periodically. \xc2\xa0But I do think that he also thought it would an opportunity for him to sort of show some solidarity with members of Congress, even as they were out having a good time on the baseball diamond; that he could also sort of demonstrate that he\xe2\x80\x99s paying close attention to the important work that they\xe2\x80\x99re considering on the floor of the House of Representatives these days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Clearly, it was a hastily made decision, no?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was, on relatively short notice. \xc2\xa0But thanks to the agility of your colleagues in the press corps, we got most members of the White House press pool into the van in time to go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Doug.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Doug. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Doug.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I apologize.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s all right, no problem. \xc2\xa0Changing subjects to the cyber intrusion, the cyber espionage at the Office of Personnel and Management. \xc2\xa0I think it was earlier in the week you said it was 4.1 former and present federal employees who were potentially subject to this intrusion. \xc2\xa0I think the AP reported today that the number may be much higher. \xc2\xa0So I think two people who had been briefed on the matter -- as high as 14 million. \xc2\xa0Can you confirm that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Doug, at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have additional details about the ongoing investigation into this particular matter. \xc2\xa0You will recall that our law enforcement professionals did make an announcement at the end of last week about their preliminary knowledge that they had accumulated so far about the scope of this particular intrusion. \xc2\xa0But that investigation continues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The thing that I mentioned yesterday in talking about this is that sometimes our investigators are reluctant to talk publicly in much detail about what exactly they have learned because it can give some helpful insight to our adversaries, frankly, about what kinds of techniques are used to investigate and mitigate and even deter these kinds of intrusions. \xc2\xa0So I know that our investigators are, however, committed to making sure that those who have been affected by this particular intrusion are advised as soon as possible, and that they get the resources and information that they need to make sure that they can protect themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple cybersecurity experts tell me that this is the biggest cyber intrusion since the Edward Snowden affair. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, just given the massive size and scope of the federal bureaucracy and the cumbersome nature of turning around an aircraft carrier this size, whether the federal government is nimble enough to address these kinds of attacks when they can be changed so quickly, yet the federal government cannot with its procurement policies have competitive bidding on protection for these kinds of things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Doug, you\'re right that this -- that protecting the computer networks of the federal government is a daunting challenge, and it does require the federal government to be nimble -- something that\'s difficult when you\'re talking about an organization that\'s this large.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are a number of steps that this administration has taken to try to address those concerns. \xc2\xa0We can get you a pretty good rundown of those things. \xc2\xa0But clearly, there\xe2\x80\x99s more that needs to get done. \xc2\xa0These are the kinds of challenges -- this challenge that\'s facing the federal government is not dissimilar from the challenge that\'s facing the private sector, and large organizations in the private sector, as well. \xc2\xa0And that\'s one of the reasons that we have been pretty forceful in calling on Congress to pass cybersecurity legislation that the President has already sent up to Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are some steps that we could implement that require congressional authorization that could make not just the federal government but also the private sector more nimble and more effective in communicating with one another to make sure that we\'re doing everything we can to protect the computer networks and the data of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me give you one example of that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this quickly, is one of the priorities when it comes to dealing with these matters -- and in being nimble -- is information sharing. \xc2\xa0That one of the things that we can do is if one private sector entity has been the victim of an intrusion or even an attempted intrusion, sharing information about how that intrusion was attempted with other industries and with the federal government can be an effective way of making sure that other computer networks, including the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s computer networks, can be shored up to protect against a similar intrusion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that\'s one of the reasons that we are aggressively advocating Congress to pass this piece of legislation, and it would have a tangible impact on the ability of this country to protect the data of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Since we know that the Chinese probably have access to background checks and security clearances now, they therefore know who American contacts are in China with Chinese people, friends, family, associates, confidants in that country. \xc2\xa0Do you think it might be necessary to remove people from embassy positions in China who have close contacts on the outside who are themselves Chinese?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Doug, we have not discussed publicly what we know right now about the extent of this cyber intrusion. \xc2\xa0We have acknowledged that, potentially, sensitive data about a substantial number of federal employees was breached, or is at least now at risk. \xc2\xa0But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked publicly about the details of that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that the State Department has made the decision to take any actions in response to this specific matter. \xc2\xa0But if they have, you should ask them about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And quickly, one last question on this. \xc2\xa0Would people as high as Cabinet-level officers have that data stored at OPM -- background check information, clearance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0I know that there is a substantial amount of data that is maintained at OPM. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more details about what\xe2\x80\x99s there. \xc2\xa0We will not at this point be able to discuss in much detail about which data or how much data may potentially be affected in this particular incident.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jerome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0A Muslim Brother delegation was in town this week. \xc2\xa0And I understand they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to meet either people from State or here at the White House. \xc2\xa0Have you decided to cut all ties with this organization?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0Jerome, there has been no change in our policy with respect to the Muslim Brotherhood. \xc2\xa0The Obama administration and the United States routinely engage with representatives from across the political spectrum in all countries around the world. \xc2\xa0And members of the Obama administration have in the past met with Muslim Brotherhood representatives including as recently as earlier this year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it is true that no one from the White House or from the administration met with the current delegation, but that does not reflect any change in our policy toward the Muslim Brotherhood.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why is that then?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\'t have a detailed explanation to share with you, other than to say that we\'re going to choose when is the appropriate time to meet with these foreign interlocutors. \xc2\xa0And we have obviously met with the Muslim Brotherhood in the past, as recently as early this year. \xc2\xa0But on this visit, no one from the administration will be meeting with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Olivier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on the OPM hack, Harry Reid has said that the Chinese were behind this hack. \xc2\xa0Do you dispute that characterization?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Olivier, we have declined to offer our own official assessment about who may be responsible for this particular intrusion. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t have any information to share with you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that long ago that the President made new policy by green-lighting the use of economic sanctions against people tied to cyber intrusions, such as this one, potentially -- though obviously it was announced before this. \xc2\xa0How close are you to announcing -- if you plan to announce -- retaliatory steps targeting either individuals or nation states at this point?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s correct, Olivier, the President did sign an executive order earlier this year authorizing the Secretary of Treasury to make some decisions about designating for sanctions individuals who may be responsible for specific cyber intrusions or just merely benefit from those cyber intrusions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In talking about sanctions in the past, you know that we have often said that it is not in our interest to telegraph in advance any decisions that we may be making related to sanctions, primarily because it gives those who may be targeted the opportunity to move around their assets to try to escape these sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much insight to share with you, unfortunately, about where we are in that decision-making process other than to confirm for you that this newly available option is one that is on the table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A few more on the same subject, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to keep it quick. \xc2\xa0First, how concerned are you that this is going to chase qualified people out of government, or dissuade qualified people from joining government if they worry that their confidential information -- and some of these forms get into a lot of detail, and they\xe2\x80\x99re very personal information -- if this is compromised? \xc2\xa0How concerned are you about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Olivier, I think the reason I\'m not particularly concerned about that matter is that this is a challenge that is facing the private sector as well. \xc2\xa0And I know that those individuals who are being recruited by private sector entities also have to turn over significant amounts of personal information.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the need and the strategy for protecting that information is something that both private sector experts and federal government experts grapple with. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President spent a lot of time encouraging those in the private sector to coordinate with federal government experts so that they can share knowledge and best practices and devise strategies that will bolster the defenses of both public and private computer systems.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So trying to facilitate that kind of coordination we believe will benefit everybody. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this is a significant challenge and one that is a priority for many private sector companies. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also a priority for the President and every federal government agency that he\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one for you. \xc2\xa0A lot of federal employees have received emails telling that their information was compromised and offering them support with credit monitoring. \xc2\xa0Have you received that message, and have you availed yourself of that service?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not received that message at this point. \xc2\xa0My understanding is that the notification process, though, is one that is a rolling one.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Toluse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Just one on OPM before I have another question on trade. \xc2\xa0On the OPM hack, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to give a number in terms of -- we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing as high as 14 million. \xc2\xa0But if you\xe2\x80\x99re not -- if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go that far, are you at least willing to say that during the investigation, the FBI has expanded beyond the initial estimates and that you actually believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s broader than what it was when you first announced?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Toluse, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details to share with you about the investigation at this point. \xc2\xa0That as our investigators at the FBI and DHS gather more information, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable -- if they reach a point where they\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable sharing more information, I\'m confident that they will. \xc2\xa0But that information will come from them first, not from me, because they\xe2\x80\x99ll be making the decisions consistent with what they believe is in the best interest of the ongoing investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the 4 million number that we heard last week, is that the number that you\xe2\x80\x99re sticking to? \xc2\xa0Is that a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that is the latest number that was announced by the Department of Homeland Security, I believe, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you beyond that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then also, last week you were asked about whether or not federal contractors were a part of this, and you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. \xc2\xa0Is there any update to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you an answer to that. \xc2\xa0The other thing you can do is actually contact OPM and see if they can get you an answer too. \xc2\xa0But if both of us try that, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you an answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on trade, the TAA issue came up actually I think back on Monday or Tuesday with the Medicare fix. \xc2\xa0And it seemed like Speaker Pelosi -- Leader Pelosi was on board. \xc2\xa0She worked out a deal with John Boehner to fix that and take that off the table, and then it ended up that she voted against it. \xc2\xa0Were you surprised that after being on board she switched -- seemed to come out against it? \xc2\xa0And should the White House have done more to attack the TAA issue since you knew about this much earlier in the week and the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up on the Hill until Friday to take on this issue specifically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Toluse, a couple things about that. \xc2\xa0The President has been engaged in having a number of telephone conversations and in-person conversations over the last several weeks on this issue. \xc2\xa0So I\'m not sure anybody can question the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to engaging on this issue to build important bipartisan support for a legislative priority of his. \xc2\xa0And I think there is tangible evidence to indicate that that strategy was successful because of the passage with a bipartisan majority of TPA legislation. \xc2\xa0We obviously have additional work to do on the TAA bill.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen we were discussing this earlier this week, I complimented both Leader Pelosi and Speaker Boehner for effectively coordinating to resolve some concerns that some Democrats had raised about the pay-for of the TAA bill. \xc2\xa0And in the days ahead -- again, I hope that Democrats and Republicans will summon a similar bipartisan spirit to build a bipartisan majority for this legislation that, again, in the past, has earned strong support from Democratic members of the House of Representatives -- unanimous support last time it was considered.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere also is ample reason for Republicans to consider voting for this piece of legislation. \xc2\xa0We saw a substantial number of Republicans vote for it today, including the Speaker of the House. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that House Republicans will continue to lend support to a program that the President believes is critically important to supporting middle-class families, particularly those that are dealing with the challenging forces of globalization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So does your strategy on trade sort of shift now to a new strategy specifically focused on TAA? \xc2\xa0And if so, what is the new tactic that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to use? \xc2\xa0Are you mostly going to focus on getting Democrats to I guess be fearful that this program is going to end in September? \xc2\xa0Or are you going to try to get Republicans to change their position and get the total package passed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what has served us well in this process so far in terms of successfully passing TPA through the Senate and passing TAA through the Senate in bipartisan fashion, again, passing TPA through the House in bipartisan fashion today -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that our strategy has worked.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we obviously have more work to do, but our strategy has been to make the case to both Democrats and Republicans about why they should support this legislation. \xc2\xa0Now, there are certain arguments that Republicans find more persuasive, and there are other arguments that Democrats find more persuasive. \xc2\xa0I actually would just submit that that means that there are a whole lot of reasons to support TPA. \xc2\xa0The same applies when it comes to TAA.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, this also is not about trying to scare people. \xc2\xa0This is actually about raising a legitimate concern. \xc2\xa0The fact is, this is a piece of legislation, a program that previously was supported by every single Democrat in the House of Representatives that is set to expire at the end of September. \xc2\xa0And what the President has advocated doing is not just preventing the lapse of that program; the President has actually put forward a specific proposal with a specific pay-for that was worked out between Leader Pelosi and Speaker Boehner to significantly expand that program in a way that would double the amount of money that\xe2\x80\x99s available every year, and in a way that would allow 17,000 people who over the last 18 months have previously seen their applications rejected, to allow them to have their applications reconsidered. \xc2\xa0These are 17,000 workers who are in need right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if the House will pass this bill, we can set about the work of trying to consider their eligibility again, under a different set of circumstances. \xc2\xa0That is going to open up access to these important benefits to many more people, and that is entirely consistent with the kind of progressive values that the President has long championed and that we know are strongly supported by members of -- Democratic members of the House of Representatives, and even some Republicans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So a little bit to follow up on that. \xc2\xa0When Leader Pelosi was on the floor, she was talking about trying to get a better deal for workers. \xc2\xa0Has she asked you, or is seeking more money, or a greater package? \xc2\xa0Is there something you can offer her?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific requests that Leader Pelosi may have made, but again, this has been part of the conversations that she\xe2\x80\x99s had with Speaker Boehner. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there may be some requests that have been made of the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, I think the case that we would make would be focused on the amount of benefits that are included here. \xc2\xa0And again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the letter from Secretary Perez that he sent to the Hill yesterday, the detailing, the extensive assistance that would be offered in this legislation, and explaining how this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a renewal of a previously passed package, but actually is a significant expansion of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I just wanted to bring your attention to something that Congressman Jim Himes said; he\xe2\x80\x99s one of your supporters on trade. \xc2\xa0He said today\xe2\x80\x99s vote on TAA \xe2\x80\x9chobbled the Democratic President.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how you square the claim that the strategy is working when even your allies are saying -- or suggesting that the President\xe2\x80\x99s powers of persuasion are perhaps diminished here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, all I would do -- and I would say this to Congressman Himes too -- is I would just encourage him to consider the track record here; that over the last month, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the Senate came together and beat the odds and built a bipartisan majority to pass TPA. \xc2\xa0The Senate came together, built a bipartisan majority to pass TAA. \xc2\xa0Just today, the House of Representatives came together, built a bipartisan majority, even in the face of some pretty intense skepticism inside the Beltway, and passed TPA.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe remaining stumbling block, one that I acknowledge remains, is when it comes to trade adjustment assistance. \xc2\xa0But I think as I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a number of times here already today, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very strong case to make to Democrats about how middle-class families all across the country would benefit significantly from the proposed expansion of trade adjustment assistance. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make the case that they should support it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep doing that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSarah.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I think after today\xe2\x80\x99s vote and floor statements it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that all the current leaders of the Democratic Party have come out and taken a position on trade. \xc2\xa0Hillary Clinton is the frontrunner right now to be the future leader of the Democratic Party. \xc2\xa0She would benefit from fast-track authority if she became President. \xc2\xa0How would it affect things in the House if she came out and took a position? \xc2\xa0And is President Obama satisfied with the leadership being shown right now from one of his potential successors?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We would be very concerned about the position of Secretary Clinton if she had a vote in the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0I assure you that if she did, she would be subject to a pretty aggressive lobbying campaign by the President on down. \xc2\xa0And we would be optimistic about the persuasive case we would be able to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, however, she does not have a vote in the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s doing what she\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be doing right now, which is focused on running a presidential campaign. \xc2\xa0And --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99d be influential? \xc2\xa0Sorry to cut you off. \xc2\xa0But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s be influential to these House members? \xc2\xa0She would potentially be at the top of the ticket in the reelections that they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it is entirely possible that -- she is obviously a significant figure in the Democratic Party, and people care a lot about what she has to say. \xc2\xa0But she\xe2\x80\x99s focused on running her campaign right now, and is not focused on whipping votes in the House of Representatives, one way or the other. \xc2\xa0And that means that she\xe2\x80\x99s got her priorities straight right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As others have mentioned, there is this perception that throughout the President\xe2\x80\x99s term, that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really engaged very much with members of Congress, and you have contested that perception. \xc2\xa0But why is that so widespread if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the case?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, frankly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I think that what the President has pursued is a strategy that has sought to engage members of Congress on important legislative priorities. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been on full display not just in the last 24 hours or so, but over the last several weeks, particularly on this particular trade issue. \xc2\xa0And it served us very well in terms of the success we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in passing these legislative priorities through the Senate. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some additional work to do in the House, but we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the important progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made so far.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Fred, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Something that has come up in the course of the debate is something that Paul Ryan had addressed this week, is whether TPA might down the road allow the President to implement climate rules or immigration rules. \xc2\xa0One Republican during the House debate said that his concerns about that were satisfied. \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask, from the White House perspective, would the White House or would the administration ever consider using future trade deals if TPA is put into place for climate or immigration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding, Fred, is there\xe2\x80\x99s actually specific language that\xe2\x80\x99s included in the legislation that prohibits that. \xc2\xa0This, I think, is a pretty good example of where there are significant disagreements between Democrats and -- between Republicans and this President. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we believe that immigration reform is a priority because of the economic benefits it would shower on our economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear that dealing with climate change is a top priority. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, the President has sought very aggressively to make progress in those areas, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t need TPA to do it. \xc2\xa0So the President is going to continue to advocate dealing with the causes of climate change, and the President is going to continue to implement many of the executive actions that he announced at the end of last year to reform our broken immigration system. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s do the week ahead.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s TWA.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR.
