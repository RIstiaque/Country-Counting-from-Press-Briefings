EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just want to mention a couple of things before I get started here.\xc2\xa0 First, as you all know, we had an employment report today that showed private sector payrolls increasing by 268,000 in April, which makes 14 consecutive months of private sector employment growth.\xc2\xa0 During that period, the economy added 2.1 million private sector jobs, including more than 800,000 jobs since the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is obviously good news.\xc2\xa0 The February number was revised upwards to 261,000 private sector jobs created, and the March number was estimated upward to 231,000 -- very, very solid; an average of approximately a quarter of a million private sector jobs created each month for three straight months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re pleased about that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have a lot more work to do.\xc2\xa0 The recession cost the American labor force 8 million jobs and we\'re still digging ourselves out of that hole.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNext I\'d like to just remind you about where we\'re going today.\xc2\xa0 The President will first visit Allison Transmission, which is a leader in hybrid technology and the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest manufacturer of fully automatic transmissions for medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, tactical military vehicles, and hybrid compulsion systems.\xc2\xa0 This visit is meant to highlight the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to diversifying our energy requirements, to reduce our dependence on imported oil, and to ensure that we are leaders in clean energy technology in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, I just wanted to note that when we go to Fort Campbell today, the President and Vice President will be visiting with members of the 101st Airborne Division, which, if you don\'t know, has such a remarkable history, beginning in World War II, where they were the first allied forces to set foot on occupied France territory; fought valiantly through World War II; were a vital division during the Cold War, Vietnam, Operation Desert Storm and then obviously in the Iraq war, and most recently in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Extraordinary service, extraordinary sacrifice.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is less known is that it was elements of the 101st Airborne Division who were sent by President Eisenhower to Little Rock to ensure that the \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Rock Nine\xe2\x80\x9d attended Little Rock Central High School.\xc2\xa0 It was also elements of the 101st that were sent to help make sure that James Meredith was able to attend as the first African American at the University of Mississippi.\xc2\xa0 So it is a noble, noble history.\xc2\xa0 And both the President and Vice President look forward to that visit.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President has said he doesn\'t want to spike the ball.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking to troops.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t he expect a celebratory mood there in the wake of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xc2\xa0 And does that kind of go against that mood that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to -- a non-gloating mood?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President spiking the ball or gloating when he speaks to troops returning from Afghanistan today.\xc2\xa0 The point he will make is that while the successful mission against Osama bin Laden was an historic and singular event, it does not by any means mean that we are finished with the war against al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 The fight goes on.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one of the reasons why the President refocused our resources and attention on the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, increased our commitment there in terms of troops -- which these troops represent -- is because he believed very strongly that al Qaeda central was the number one target -- should be the number one target of that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s going to speak to these troops to thank them for their service.\xc2\xa0 They have fought valiantly and incurred significant casualties in that effort.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no intent to gloat at all in that regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he meeting with members of the teams that carried out the operation to get Osama bin Laden?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that he is meeting with special operators -- some special operators who were involved in that, but that is all I can say.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the bin Laden operation, Al Arabia is reporting that al Qaeda is now -- may not come as a shock -- threatening to attack the U.S. in retaliation for killing bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of that?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s his thinking on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are aware of it, seen the reports.\xc2\xa0 What it does do, obviously, is acknowledge the obvious, which is that Osama bin Laden was killed on Sunday night by U.S. forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any more concern now that there\xe2\x80\x99s been --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re being extremely vigilant.\xc2\xa0 You can ask questions of the Department of Homeland Security as well, but the -- we\xe2\x80\x99re quite aware of the potential for activity and are highly vigilant on that matter for that reason.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things we saw I think last night was the notice that DHS put out with regard to the information collected about the consideration at least of a terrorist plot against American railways back in February of 2010.\xc2\xa0 The fact that the world\xe2\x80\x99s most wanted terrorist might have been considering further terror plots against the United States is not a surprise, but it reminds us, of course, that we need to remain ever vigilant.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you at least tell us whether this group of special operators that you referred to will include Navy SEALs or helicopter pilots --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say anything more about that.\xc2\xa0 It is extremely important that I say nothing more.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re done with the bin Laden questions, or are you not?\xc2\xa0 On another matter, the Republican congressional leaders appear to be backing away from attempting to pass their Medicare plan prior to the 2012 election it\xe2\x80\x99s widely reported today.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say simply that the talks that the Vice President led yesterday, the initial meeting of the members of Congress and team from the administration, was productive.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing if those who are participating in those negotiations understand that in order to achieve compromise, we need to find common ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe obviously have -- the President has laid out his plan, and there are elements of stark contrast with the House Republican\xe2\x80\x99s budget that passed.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for now is where we can find some common ground to achieve a goal that Republicans and Democrats share, which is reducing the debt significantly, getting our fiscal house in order and, as the President sees it, while making sure that we protect the investments we need to protect in order to continue to grow the economy, continue to create jobs and educate our children.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any reaction to the report today that CEO pay is up 25 percent over last year\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him react to that, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us anything about the President\xe2\x80\x99s immigration speech next week and any other events from the week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the speech will reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to find a bipartisan way to create a bipartisan -- rather comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 As I think I said earlier this week, the fact that we were not able to achieve that in the first two years only means that we need to refocus our efforts and try to find that compromise.\xc2\xa0 In the past, obviously there has been Republican support for the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that is necessary and we hope that there will be again in the future.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- rest of the week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do have that, if you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you field more questions after?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you want to ask those questions first, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In April of 2008, President Obama -- or then candidate Obama appeared at a gas station in Indiana -- gas was at $3.60 a gallon -- said we need to vote for change, a new set of policies. He\xe2\x80\x99s returning to Indiana now with gas well over $4.00 a gallon. What does it say about the success he has had over the last three years in dealing with the fuel issue, the gas issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak quite a lot lately about the impact of high gas prices on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 pocketbooks and wallets.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 We do note the steep drop in oil prices in the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 And I would also note that one of the things the Attorney General task force will be looking at is coordinating with state attorneys general to make sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a what I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard described as a \xe2\x80\x9crockets-and-parachutes phenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d where prices at the pump rocket up when oil prices rocket up, and yet they come down in a parachute fashion when oil prices go down.\xc2\xa0 So we want to make sure that a drop in oil prices is appropriately reflected in a drop in gas prices at the pump.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe gas prices will drop in the coming months?\xc2\xa0 The futures market seem to be indicating they will.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t predict markets here, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen a drop.\xc2\xa0 We have -- but they go up and down.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has said many times that there are no silver bullet solutions here, no short-term solutions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he is committed to -- while we are doing the things in the short term that we hope can provide some relief, the big challenge is the long-term solution that weans us off our dependence on foreign oil, that diversifies our energy supply, that allows us to build clean energy industries in the United States that both enhance our national security and provide quality jobs in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s been his commitment; you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him speak about that many times.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him speak about it again today in Indiana.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about all the Monday morning quarterbacking on the Osama bin Laden operation?\xc2\xa0 Does he think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful -- all the criticism and the questioning about how it went down?\xc2\xa0 Does it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard much criticism about how it went down.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard is a pretty universal acclamation of the fact that a remarkable team of U.S. personnel conducted one of the most -- one of the riskiest operations imaginable flawlessly, and limited collateral damage and civilian casualties, achieved their goal of bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, and returned safely every single American.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that is what most people have focused on, appropriately, because it was a remarkable achievement that was the product of years of intelligence work, years of training in the case of the personnel involved in the actual mission, and some very bold decision-making by the President and others to bring this about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how did he feel about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s events in New York?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He felt very good about it.\xc2\xa0 I think he -- the meetings with firefighters, with the police, with families and loved ones of victims were powerful events.\xc2\xa0 And I think he understands that this is a bittersweet moment, especially for those who lost loved ones in 9/11, both in New York, in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 And he was very glad he made the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President won Indiana by less than 30,000 votes in \xe2\x80\x9908.\xc2\xa0 Does he think that it\xe2\x80\x99s as tough or even tougher political environment right now for him to get support for his agenda or even win reelection?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a long time before next year\xe2\x80\x99s election, and he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the things that a President needs to be focused on -- our national security -- his focus on that I think has been quite evident in the last several days; and the economy, which is what he\xe2\x80\x99ll be focusing on today in Indiana.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that the President firmly believes that making the right policy decisions tends to be beneficial come political season, but for him, at least, political season is a long way off.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we\xe2\x80\x99re flying into another swing state.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is that this -- Allison Transmission is, as I just read to you, a major manufacturer of the kind of the technology that the President believes is going to help us win the future in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 So I think we go where the action is, and in this case, this company is where the action is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President watch the Fox News Republican debate last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I think there was some basketball on last night -- maybe there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, maybe that\'s tonight -- so I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I think the Bulls are playing tonight, is that right?\xc2\xa0 Well, come on, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.\xc2\xa0 Okay, I can do the week ahead if you don\'t have any more questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will meet with heads of the Chinese Strategic Economic Dialogue delegation at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will travel, as you know, to the El Paso, Texas area to deliver a speech on comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He will then travel to Austin, Texas, before returning to Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will participate in a CBS Town Hall at the Newseum.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President and the First Lady will host a celebration of American poetry and prose by welcoming accomplished poets, musicians and artists, as well as students, from across the country to the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will deliver remarks at the National Hispanic Prayer Breakfast.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd on Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The town hall is Wednesday, not Thursday?\xc2\xa0 Initially it was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct, it\xe2\x80\x99s Wednesday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:52 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
