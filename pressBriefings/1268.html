GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of campaign-related questions.\xc2\xa0 Two weeks from Election Day.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s appearances this week and next week, are we going to hear anything new in his message, or has he really solidified the message going forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to hear the President make a very strong and affirmative case for continuing to move the country forward and the perils of what it means to go back.\xc2\xa0 That\'s I think been the basis of his message for quite a while.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to hear that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\'re not going to see him try to roll out another message?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, looking at this Western swing, Boxer and Reid and Murray -- those are candidates that the President has been campaigning for, pretty frequently the First Lady is, Biden has.\xc2\xa0 What is it about those three races that has the White House so interested?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re all important races.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re important votes in the Senate; they\xe2\x80\x99re important races.\xc2\xa0 The President knows each one of them from his work and their work in the Senate and is anxious to go out and campaign for all three of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel like he can be more effective in those states than in states like Arkansas or West Virginia?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President, if you look at -- has campaigned in states throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 Just this past weekend we were in Ohio.\xc2\xa0 I think people tend to forget that before Governor Patrick there was 16 years of Republican governors in the state of Massachusetts -- not exactly easy gubernatorial territory, at least in the recent past, for Democrats. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the President is going to go and hit a lot of places; the Vice President, the First Lady, they\xe2\x80\x99ll all hit important races as we head into -- head to the finish of the campaign season.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us about his schedule for next week, what states he\'ll be hitting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not yet.\xc2\xa0 Not yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the White House concerned that some banks are lifting their foreclosure freezes too soon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you saw in the statement that I put out, there is an ongoing process through FHA -- started before this round of stories -- where we had concerns and wanted to ensure that services are complying fully with the laws of this country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTomorrow, at HUD, there\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting of regulators, including Secretary Donovan, Secretary Geithner, Tom Perrelli from the Justice Department -- to talk through sort of where we are on our look at this process.\xc2\xa0 And that process, again, as I said, is -- will continue over the course of the next several weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned your statement this morning.\xc2\xa0 Was that -- the reason for your sending that fueled by any concern about this lifting of freezes happening too quickly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we are -- our concern has been in ensuring that the process adequately complies with the law.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what led FHA to get involved in this.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s led the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to be involved in this process, as well as our support for 50 state attorneys general ensuring, again, compliance with the law.\xc2\xa0 That is -- obviously that\'s tremendously important in this process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe have talked about, over the past week or so, the danger that we see in, though, halting the entire housing market and the danger that it would provide -- or potentially provide writ large and its effect on the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s still not clear to me if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- are they lifting these freezes too soon, or is that not a concern?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that is a -- we are looking at their process in order to determine their compliance with the law.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they have certain requirements under the law that have to be met, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re not meeting those requirements they certainly can face fines from us and they can face legal action from homeowners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President discuss this with Secretary Geithner in their meeting today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if this came up specifically.\xc2\xa0 My guess is it likely did.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s economic daily briefing centered on this last week and there have certainly been meetings with Secretary Donovan and others around this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking to any of his friends and contacts in the banking industry about this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a new ABC News/Yahoo News poll, 55 percent of the American people say the Tea Party candidates can effectively bring about major changes in the way government operates.\xc2\xa0 How did the President and the Democrats lose the mantle of change?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you\'re talking about repealing the minimum wage that would be significant change.\xc2\xa0 I think if you\'re talking about questioning the validity of whether Social Security should happen, or whether there should be a Department of Education -- I think that all qualifies significant change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I said \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively bring about major change\xe2\x80\x9d --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That would effectively bring about major change. Jake, I\'d have to look more closely at what the poll says.\xc2\xa0 This is not necessarily in relation to the Tea Party, but I think there continues to be a frustration with the pace of our economic recovery, based largely on the fact that, as I\'ve said before, the hole that we\xe2\x80\x99re in is huge.\xc2\xa0 The number of jobs that we lost\xc2\xa0 -- 8 million or so jobs -- the number of jobs we lost leading up to the last election is a significant amount.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Later this week, the administration is going to release a report on women in the economy, at the same time President Obama will be campaigning for two embattled women senators -- Murray and Boxer.\xc2\xa0 Is there a relation between the two?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think obviously we are -- the President has been focused throughout this administration on our economic recovery, on ensuring that businesses have the credit they need to expand.\xc2\xa0 I think this is just a continuation of that concern and demonstrating what can and should be done to fix our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At these monthly AfPak meetings -- and the President will have one again tomorrow -- is this a chance to tweak the strategy in that region, or is it more of a comprehensive update for the President? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hesitate to say what the meeting would involve since the meeting is tomorrow -- in terms of its update.\xc2\xa0 I think the President gets from -- both a military and diplomatic update on a weekly basis from that region of the world, and as you said, a monthly secure video teleconference with many of the same players, to go about the developments in that region and to discuss where we are in several of our goals, including -- and I\'m sure the President will get, as he does, a regular update on where we are in our goals at training a Afghan national security force, both a police and an army.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I\'d have a better sense of the tweaking part of that question after tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do these meetings -- since he does have these weekly updates as well, I\'m trying to get a sense of what kind of weight is given to these meetings that he has monthly.\xc2\xa0 Is it broader?\xc2\xa0 Is it more comprehensive?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this, Dan, without getting into a lot of specifics for a highly classified meeting, there are -- obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a broader perspective and then there\xe2\x80\x99s granularity as you go through and as commanders and our diplomatic representatives go through developments on the ground in different parts of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President, as I said, gets that weekly -- gets a fairly thick weekly update as well as this monthly teleconference.\xc2\xa0 And depending on the range of issues that are confronting the situation, again, it can be very granular, it can be -- I\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate that at some point it would be very granular, and at some points you\xe2\x80\x99d be much more at 30,000 feet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House satisfied with what Pakistan is doing to go after the insurgency in its own country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a Pakistani delegation here to continue the regular strategic dialogues that were begun in the spring of 2009.\xc2\xa0 I think we see an unprecedented level of cooperation from the Pakistanis in taking on insurgents, because we understand, unlike in the past, it\xe2\x80\x99s now in our mutual well-being to do so. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat having been said, then, throughout this process and throughout these meetings this week, there will be opportunities for us to detail for the Pakistanis what more must be done. And that was clear in the report that was sent to Congress and that\'s been clear in our statements about our relationship with Pakistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more question, on Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I know last week you talked about how he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to go to some of these areas with a much smaller footprint than the President would if he traveled.\xc2\xa0 But when you look at what his effectiveness might be for the midterm elections, how do you rate that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he is an effective voice for the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s an effective voice for the steps that this administration has had to take to rescue the economy, to put ourselves back on a stable financial footing.\xc2\xa0 Look, he\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous advocate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what prompted the statement on foreclosures today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We got a lot of interest off of what was going on with the process around Bank of America. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President hearing from Speaker Pelosi or Majority Leader Reid saying what about a moratorium nationally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we have -- there have obviously, Mark, been calls to do -- to freeze the process.\xc2\xa0 Again, our concern has been what that effect is for the housing market in a broader sense.\xc2\xa0 Take a state like Florida.\xc2\xa0 About a little more than a third of the housing transactions that are going on right now are individuals who are purchasing long-foreclosed, previously foreclosed homes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s in many places what is beginning to spur a housing recovery in places that have been hit extremely hard with the housing crisis and the great dip in housing prices, which obviously leads to people being underwater in their mortgage and the economy, writ large, in its ability -- in their ability to make those payments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo our concern with that moratorium is that a process that has followed all aspects of the law and is in the midst of a contract to purchase that from somebody else, that process is frozen, too.\xc2\xa0 We believe that, as I said in the statement, all services must comply with the law; they\xe2\x80\x99ll be held accountable if they don\'t.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we see the downsides of what a moratorium could do to the larger housing market.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the timing of the Hispanic education announcement today, coming two weeks before the midterms?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything political in that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, look, this is a renewal of an executive order on -- the dropout rate in the Latino community is something that\'s been talked about for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And our efforts to ensure that we\'re doing all that we can as efficiently and effectively to address it and the other educational issues are done because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, not because of the political calendar. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what does it mean to the President, to the White House agenda, to retain control -- Democratic control in the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that we are -- I think we have a common -- we have a sense of what has to happen over the course of the next couple years.\xc2\xa0 We have to continue our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 The President outlined in the past month or so ideas for cutting taxes on businesses as it relates to expensing and new purchases, our investments in construction and infrastructure that are tremendously important to getting things going. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe understand that we have to take a look and deal with our midterm and long-term financial picture.\xc2\xa0 We have to implement the important reforms in both health care and in Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 That is going to happen regardless of -- needs to happen regardless of the makeup of either body in the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You took some heat in July for a prediction about the election --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a prediction in July.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess you suggested the possibility that the Republicans could take control.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s not a change of heart in terms of your analysis?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look back in the days after that, I said the same thing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President surprised that some of these Western races are tight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- again, I think we\'re -- I said this on Sunday as well -- I think the political environment mainly is driven because of our economic environment.\xc2\xa0 We\'re at 9.6 unemployment.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen 8 million people lose their jobs. We\'ve been dealing with a housing crisis for several years -- all of which we\'re making progress on.\xc2\xa0 The housing market largely stabilized; nine months of private sector job growth.\xc2\xa0 We\'re moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message out on the campaign trail because that\'s what we see as the facts on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Kentucky Senate race has gotten kind of nasty over a campaign ad about Rand Paul\xe2\x80\x99s religion when he was in college. Does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to move on from digging into people\xe2\x80\x99s religion, particularly in their youth?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not talked to him -- I\'ve not seen the ad; I\'ve not talked to the President about the ad. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys have proposed a $250 emergency payment to seniors because there\xe2\x80\x99s no cost of living adjustment to this year from Social Security.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering -- I mean, the reason Social Security didn\xe2\x80\x99t enact another COLA is because the cost of living didn\xe2\x80\x99t go up, so I just wonder how you justify spending -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'ve seen an economy that has seen the savings of seniors, as a result of investments, change dramatically. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is $250 going to help with that, though?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it did when we did it in the Recovery Act, just like I think it did with Make Work Pay, and I think would make a difference in the lives of seniors now, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the Making Work Pay tax cut, which obviously was about a third of the stimulus for these tax cuts --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right -- Making Work Pay was, if my math is correct, about $40 [billion] of the $290 billion or so in tax cuts, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you got these tax cuts in the stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Our poll, for example, continually shows people don\'t think health care is a good idea.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you feel any responsibility that Democrats are fighting so hard in these races and a lot of them, frankly, losing because of a failure to communicate on some of these policies, in particular, a lot of people not even knowing, for example, or realizing that they got a tax cut.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, because in some of these places you may have states and localities that have raised property taxes or raised different taxes in order to deal with budget gaps and budget deficits.\xc2\xa0 In terms of Making Work Pay -- we modeled Making Work Pay differently than tax cuts that had been done previously where one check was mailed out.\xc2\xa0 And when people get one check, they realize this is all we\xe2\x80\x99re getting.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of that, it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to get that money back into the economy.\xc2\xa0 If people get it spread out in a consistent way -- and we know from economic data that people tend to spend that money -- that was the point of that tax cut. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could that have been explained better?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a political question as opposed to the substantive reasons why you designed it that way. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we did it based on the substance of wanting to get the economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 Look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen just in the last couple of days a fairly prominent Republican pollster -- you mentioned health care -- discuss why it\xe2\x80\x99s not such a good idea to talk about repealing health care reform.\xc2\xa0 The seniors that got checks to start beginning to close the doughnut hole, something that was left as part of the prescription drug act that was passed in the early 2000s; that people up to 26 can stay on their parent\xe2\x80\x99s insurance; that for the first time they\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions -- families are making decisions that are not at the mercy of a child that\xe2\x80\x99s sick, getting kicked off of their own health care -- I think those are issues that make a real difference in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken numerous times about the Republican failures to reach -- to work with you on various issues.\xc2\xa0 Given\xc2\xa0 -- looking ahead to next year, are you considering at all what the White House -- if the White House needs a different approach in working with Republicans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we will continue to reach out to those on the other side of the aisle to get things done on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 We will -- I did see I think it was an ABC poll that demonstrated that the President -- the American people view the President as having, by about a two-to-one margin, a willingness to work with others to solve problems.\xc2\xa0 The same poll shows that by a two-to-one margin, Republicans in Congress are not seen that way.\xc2\xa0 So I think the actions of the Republican Party in deciding not to be part of helping on economic recovery -- despite the fact that they have on occasion asked to be part of the spending on economic recovery -- not doing anything on Wall Street reform and things like that, I think regardless of the outcome of the elections, people are going to -- voters will expect that the two parties will work together to solve their problems.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they expected after 2006, after 2008.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s, I think, what they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to expect after 2010.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve just explained how you guys have done such a good job at that.\xc2\xa0 So my question is whether given voter expectations, you think that you should continue approaching it the same way that you have or whether the White House needs to change anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we will continue to reach out to the other side of the aisle to solve the problems that the American people most want us to address.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask Mitch McConnell, who stated quite clearly that the strategy was not to cooperate and to say no.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask John Boehner, who -- as I have used the example before -- put out the statement opposing the stimulus, as the President was about to load the motorcade to go to Capitol Hill to talk to the Republican Caucus about the Recovery Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick thing, coming off that.\xc2\xa0 How do you see this changing with this influx of -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that Republicans are going to win seats and a lot of them are going to be Tea Party candidates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get in the business of what the makeup is.\xc2\xa0 I think that even as you look at voter preferences, looking underneath the numbers, people are -- people want the two sides to work together.\xc2\xa0 They want us to address the issues that they face. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou look back at, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, 1994, and if you look at the standing -- just look at the standing of the Republican Party leading into 1994 and leading into 2010, then you have a fairly stark difference in how the party is viewed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s because the Republican Party has through its political strategy not offered a series of alternative ideas.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve just said no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get better?\xc2\xa0 You have the President\xe2\x80\x99s re-elect in 2012 -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do, because I think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you have a lot of moderate -- or the Republican senators who are dealmakers are going to be up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the message from voters will be that we want people to solve problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say that again and again, but you -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked this question to you before and you don\xe2\x80\x99t take any responsibility for any of the problems.\xc2\xa0 You think it\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred percent on the Republican side.\xc2\xa0 So how is that solving problems in Washington?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 I think when you asked me this question last week, I said, I am not up here to say we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a hundred percent of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done perfectly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is something that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t done right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, Laura, this is -- there are two lanes between here and the Capitol, one that goes this way and one that goes that way.\xc2\xa0 When we were loading up the motorcade to go that way, the statement was coming this way.\xc2\xa0 I think it was with The New York Times, Mitch McConnell said, our strategy was to simply say no to everything. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAm I surprised that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been massive political cooperation when the leaders of both parties [sic] have told newspaper reporters that their strategy is to say no to everything? No.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not that na\xc3\xafve.\xc2\xa0 I can read.\xc2\xa0 That was their strategy and it\xe2\x80\x99s been pulled off very effectively.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why people don\xe2\x80\x99t have a great reverence for that political party.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a few minutes ago you said that you have a sense of what has to happen in the future here.\xc2\xa0 To what extent have you all been planning for the various midterm course correction scenarios that are going to happen in a couple of weeks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In what way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, to what extent has the White House been gaming, been planning how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to respond if the Republicans take control of the House, if they make big gains in the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not been and I don\'t know of a massive number of meetings on that.\xc2\xa0 I think, Peter, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on what we have to do at hand.\xc2\xa0 There will be time for that later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait until --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there\'s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if there aren\xe2\x80\x99t plenty of things to do in the next two weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the point of having a trigger for cost-of-living increases for Social Security if every time that trigger isn\xe2\x80\x99t met the money just goes out anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, take into account the economic situation that we\xe2\x80\x99re in and understand, as I said earlier, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what happens and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what has happened to people\xe2\x80\x99s life savings, to their investments, and to the struggles that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in this economy.\xc2\xa0 Our belief was that this is still something that is needed, and that\'s why it was proposed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How closely is the administration involved in these regulatory reviews for foreclosures, as far as if something arises that might need a policy remedy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had fairly regular meetings here.\xc2\xa0 We have -- like I said, the President spent time specifically on this within the past week, even as FHA has several weeks ago begun looking into that process.\xc2\xa0 We will -- as these evaluation process, these investigations conclude, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what those show. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, I would be remiss if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that some of this will ultimately fall under the role of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an office that if we roll back Wall Street reform, won\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s important as we move forward, in ensuring that we have a voice that\'s on the side of consumers in this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions.\xc2\xa0 Twice in recent weeks, the President has quoted from the Declaration of Independence and has omitted the Declaration\xe2\x80\x99s reference to rights \xe2\x80\x9cendowed by their Creator.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why did he omit this part of the declaration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the comments, Lester, but I can assure you the President believes in the Declaration of Independence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his interview with Rolling Stone, the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you a subscriber, Lester?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thought he might be slightly --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his interview with Rolling Stone, the President called FOX News \xe2\x80\x9cdestructive to the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And my question:\xc2\xa0 Does he also believe that talk radio is destructive to the country, or is it only FOX News?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember the exact quote of the President\xe2\x80\x99s, Lester, but speech is obviously important in this country but facts involved in that speech are equally important as we enter into these political debates.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what his objection largely has been.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A federal judge in California has made it clear she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to -- probably -- uphold the stay of the injunction of "don\'t ask, don\'t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and the President said recently that "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" will end on his watch.\xc2\xa0 Is he, or will he, put pressure on Harry Reid -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to push for a vote during a lame duck session, one.\xc2\xa0 And two, depending on what happens after the midterms, how does the President see ending "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" if he has diminished majorities or no Democratic control?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, in terms of -- the process obviously with the judge will render on her own ruling.\xc2\xa0 That then likely goes to a three-judge panel to consider.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re certainly monitoring developments, as is the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President believes that the policy will end under his watch precisely because in the defense authorization bill pending in the Senate is a provision that would repeal what the President believes is unjust, what the President believes is discriminatory.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s passed the House.\xc2\xa0 The President will push for defense authorization to be passed containing that provision when the Senate comes back for the lame duck. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe have obviously a lot of important business in that legislation.\xc2\xa0 The repeal of "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" is certainly one of those aspects.\xc2\xa0 My sense is if you can get through a filibuster -- and again, everything takes 60 votes these days -- that there are a majority of U.S. senators that believe, as the President does, that this policy isn\xe2\x80\x99t right and that it harms our national security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the President will work during the lame duck to ensure that that bill is passed and that what\xe2\x80\x99s passed the House and what\xe2\x80\x99s passed in the Senate can end up on his desk for his signature.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think if we can get passed the procedural hurdles, that a majority of the U.S. Senate believes as the President does that it is time for this policy to change. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe courts have -- the courts in a number of different instances out West have determined that the lifespan of this policy is coming to its natural end.\xc2\xa0 I think that that was recognized in the House.\xc2\xa0 I think it will be recognized in the Senate and the bill -- the law will be repealed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?\xc2\xa0 If the President believes that, then why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he repeal it now?\xc2\xa0 Is he just waiting until after the election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we can\'t repeal it now because, one, the Senate is not here.\xc2\xa0 Remember, the law that was passed in the early \xe2\x80\x9890s does not give the power to repeal the law to the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a congressional action that can only be durably repealed through another legislative action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think the President was asked last Thursday at the town hall, why not simply sign an executive order like Harry Truman.\xc2\xa0 The law that was passed, I guess in 1993, does not afford for executive action to remove the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, where does the Justice Department stand on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as we said last week, we believe the law should be repealed and we believe that, as the Pentagon studies a process for an orderly transition, that we think will come to pass in repeal of the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the judge nullify the law?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then there is no law anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the earlier answer that I gave, which is we believe that a process has to be put in process for that orderly transition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the Justice Department is officially appealing the case, is it necessarily true that the President believes that "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" is a constitutional law?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I have enumerated for you the belief -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that it\xe2\x80\x99s unjust, it\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory, and that it harms our national security.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve never enumerated for us his belief on the constitutionality of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m confused, though.\xc2\xa0 If it does end up in Congress under a filibuster, would you guys force a filibuster?\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99ve never done that before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Force a filibuster?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where you actually -- you were saying that if it goes\xc2\xa0 -- if you can get through a filibuster, a Republican filibuster in Congress.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve never actually forced a filibuster before.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve never vetoed or called the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 bluff on anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe I\'m confused at what you\'re --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have 60 votes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President will work to try to get 60 votes --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t would he force a -- will you force the Republicans to filibuster it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The final passage of the bill?\xc2\xa0 Again, there has to be a vote to take -- it\xe2\x80\x99s in the underlying bill.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the base bill.\xc2\xa0 I think you can go back and find Republican quotes about the harm of not passing a defense authorization bill in the past and ensuring that we have the necessary resources for our military to do what it needs to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, on the West Coast swing, I know you said that the White House is focused on the task at hand, not on looking at what happens after the elections.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your wish list then for the next few days as you go out on this West Coast swing?\xc2\xa0 What does President Obama hope to accomplish?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he hopes to accomplish what he did over the weekend in Boston and in Ohio, in reminding -- reminding voters what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake, who has their best interest in mind, the steps that have been taken to get us out of the economic hole that we found ourselves in, and to continue to move forward on those policy decisions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s I think been the basis for what he has talked to voters about over the past couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I expect that that will continue tomorrow and throughout the trip out West. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the Afghan-Pakistan meeting tomorrow, is President Karzai going to be part of that teleconference?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He has never been a part of those monthly meetings, no.\xc2\xa0 I think on the guidance we\xe2\x80\x99ll put out the participants.\xc2\xa0 And they generally include -- they look a lot -- the roster looks a lot like the Afghan policy review meetings of last fall. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to what extent is there going to be an assessment of the peace feelers for the Taliban that we\'ve been hearing about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Reconciliation, led by the Afghans, has been a topic of many of the past meetings.\xc2\xa0 I expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get an update from General Petraeus, Ambassador Eikenberry, and others, on where they see the progress on those talks and their hopes for seeing that progress continue.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate, as in the past, that will be a big topic tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The New York Times has a story today that starts out with, what if a President cut Americans\xe2\x80\x99 income taxes by $116 billion and nobody noticed?\xc2\xa0 They had a poll last month that said that fewer than one-in-10 Americans knew that this administration had lowered taxes.\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the administration been able to effectively communicate that?\xc2\xa0 And, as you said, the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t changing his message.\xc2\xa0 Why not? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m apparently failing in effectively being able to communicate that because I got that question like two rows ago.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So apparently, it\xe2\x80\x99s me.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t get the same answer through about nine different people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll try one more time to underscore my personal ineffectiveness at communicating through an entire row of people that we\xe2\x80\x99re in an economic situation that is unprecedented; that as the federal government cut taxes and we saw the economic impact of the Making Work Pay tax cut into the paychecks of individuals, families that went on to spend that money and increase consumer demand and increase economic growth.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t making a value decision on their entire financial outlook, or whether or not the state or the locality that they live in had to raise taxes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe could have mailed checks in bulk, meaning -- when I mean \xe2\x80\x9cin bulk,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the entire amount out.\xc2\xa0 But economists found that when that happened in the past administration, most people tended to save and not spend that money.\xc2\xa0 Our hope was to get that money into the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what has happened as a result of dividing that tax cut up and putting it into people\xe2\x80\x99s paychecks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s car/ditch/Slurpee metaphor that he has been using -- (laughter)\xc2\xa0 -- he says that the idea here is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would mention that, as Mark appropriately pointed out, it now includes lattes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the Republicans can ride along in the car, but they have to sit in the backseat.\xc2\xa0 Is that language about firing up the base?\xc2\xa0 Or does the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We really mean they should sit in the back.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or does the President believe that the Republicans --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Somebody else called \xe2\x80\x9cshotgun\xe2\x80\x9d and -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a generational thing.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got it. (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Only because that was in last week\xe2\x80\x99s Rolling Stone.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGo ahead.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Peter. Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You funny man.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I try.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here all weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President talked about the importance of reaching across the aisle and you mentioned it today.\xc2\xa0 Is that kind of language conducive, though, to a constructive bipartisan relationship, when the President says they can come along, but they got to sit in the backseat?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Peter, I think the President has -- as I said earlier, I think the President has, on issues big and small, tried to work with and tried to offer opportunities for Republicans to work with Democrats in coming up with solutions for them. We\xe2\x80\x99re in a campaign season now.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually think the President thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re drinking a lot of Slurpees -- sorry.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President uses it as a metaphor for the role that Republicans have thus far played. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that regardless of the outcome, Republicans seek to participate in representative democracy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the voters demand.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ll hope to see, regardless of the outcome of this election. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGeorge.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign message, though, does seem to be directed at Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Have you reached a conclusion that this is a base election and the message should be directed at the base of the Democrats and not to independents at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we are a point in the election where we normally get to -- in every election where individuals are talking to their voters and trying to get them fired up and trying to get them out.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is working on doing.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d say -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who was on the trip on Sunday -- that seemed like a pretty big crowd to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is doing another backyard chat in Seattle.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how much have these backyard talks with, you know, everyday voters influenced his agenda.\xc2\xa0 Is it changing like how he thinks or, you know --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this is from -- dating back more than six years, the President has done some form of -- I think you can call this roughly a town hall meeting, where you hear directly from, the concerns of, and the interests of voters in America. He\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly continue to do that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think we hear the importance of cutting taxes on small businesses.\xc2\xa0 We hear the importance of continuing our education reforms.\xc2\xa0 We hear a lot of issues that are not just important to the American people but important to this administration.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to pursue policies to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re making good on the promises that the President made just a few years ago running. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the midterms.\xc2\xa0 What constitutes a win and/or loss for the Democratic Party on November 2nd?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to play predictor, April.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to talk about what the results are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m really not asking you to play predictor.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you to define it, because the way I understand it, there\xe2\x80\x99s a historic effort in this midterm election season through the Democratic Party to push for the base to get out to vote.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, in years past it had not been done.\xc2\xa0 At least, the last 12 years it had not been done.\xc2\xa0 And with that push, this historic push, there will be at least some -- there will be better than normal anticipation that the numbers will be higher than they were in the past. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to predict -- but if there will be a little bit more movement than before at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the efforts of the campaign committees and the DNC particularly at helping to fund those campaign committees has reached a level of help that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been seen certainly by those committees in any sort of recent memory. The amount of technology that\xe2\x80\x99s being used, the funds that go from the DNC, or leftover funds from the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, directly to the campaign committees that ultimately help campaigns is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 We are -- the Democratic Party is working every day to increase enthusiasm and, therefore, increase turnout as we get closer to election. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on that note, do you expect that your base in certain communities, particularly where there are more African Americans, more youth, and maybe independents, that you will see a higher than normal --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as compared to 2008?\xc2\xa0 Look, I will say this, that there rarely are instances in which -- the composition and the enthusiasm in a presidential year is obviously always different in an off-year election, by definition. They\xe2\x80\x99re different in special elections.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s our hope to take in these races a winning coalition and put them together for the Democratic candidate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that these -- again, the composition and the level -- we are not going to have as many people vote in 2010 as we had in a presidential election simply by definition of the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re off-year elections. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tStephen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President agree with David Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s contention last night in their phone call that the UK would still have a first-rate military after the defense cuts?\xc2\xa0 I noticed that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that he did during the readout you put out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check the readout.\xc2\xa0 But I think that our view is that -- certainly that the level of help and cooperation that we get and the sacrifice of that country in places like Afghanistan is certainly -- is vital and important to our coalition, and that they will indeed continue to have a first-rate military.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up, Robert?\xc2\xa0 Since that call, today Briton announced the defense budget would fall 8 percent.\xc2\xa0 Is the President still confident, knowing that now that troops, planes, tanks, et cetera will be cut by that kind of figure?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that some discussions prior to that phone call have led us to believe that indeed the readiness and the capability of the British military would continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In this busy campaign season, how is the President preparing for his trip to India next month?\xc2\xa0 And what does he wants to achieve during his trip there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to go through some of the briefings on this in the days upcoming -- but look, obviously, this is an important relationship.\xc2\xa0 It was the first state dinner that was held here.\xc2\xa0 I think that gives you the degree of understanding in terms of the significance that this government and this administration puts on that relationship.\xc2\xa0 We will have -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an important economic relationship.\xc2\xa0 It is -- which, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to go through.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the President is involved in fairly regular meetings with the national security team to ensure a successful visit not long after the elections.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important trip.\xc2\xa0 We understand -- look, just from a viewpoint economically, we understand that -- we understand what we have to do to create jobs, to grow our exports, to ensure that it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall on American consumers to drive world demand. That\'s a lot of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about on that trip, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll hopefully have some tangible results from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:08 P.M.
