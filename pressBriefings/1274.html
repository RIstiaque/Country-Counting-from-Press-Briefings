GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, we\xe2\x80\x99re missing a few folks, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll be on their way.\xc2\xa0 Let me just do a quick week ahead and then I can answer your questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, the President will attend a meeting of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Recovery Advisory Board here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will join Dr. Jill Biden at the first ever White House Summit on Community Colleges.\xc2\xa0 This event will highlight the critical role that community colleges play in developing America\xe2\x80\x99s workforce and reaching our educational goals.\xc2\xa0 The President will join Dr. Biden at the open -- at the opening session.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLater, the President and the First Lady will host a diplomatic corps reception here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And in the evening, the President will address the 2010 Fortune Magazine Most Powerful Women\xe2\x80\x99s Summit in the Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C., to talk about the impact of women in business, on the economy, and the steps we can take together to ensure that America remains competitive over the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will award Staff Sergeant Robert J. Miller of the U.S. Army the Medal of Honor.\xc2\xa0 Staff Sergeant Miller will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for his heroic actions in Afghanistan on January 25th, 2008.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will also attend that event.\xc2\xa0 Later, the President will travel to New Jersey to attend a DNC dinner.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will travel to Prince George\xe2\x80\x99s County, Maryland, to attend an event for Maryland Governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, and later travel to Chicago to attend an event for Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to overnight in Chicago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To be determined.\xc2\xa0 Working on that.\xc2\xa0 That was -- we were going back and forth on that just as I came out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the likely timeline for a permanent chief of staff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me give you a little bit of a broad answer to -- look, Pete Rouse and the President have talked through Pete\xe2\x80\x99s new assignment and both come to an agreement on being chief of staff on an interim basis.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that this is the best thing right now for our staff organization.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we had a pretty short runway with the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Chicago and ultimately Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe were in the midst of, and Pete was in charge of, looking through a two-year organizational review that, again, was in place before Rahm made any of his decisions and before the mayor announced his decision not to seek reelection; that, again, part of the normal course of turnover here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I would expect that nothing is likely to be decided on chief of staff for several months.\xc2\xa0 Pete is -- as I discussed yesterday and I think many of you all have written, Pete enjoys the complete trust of the President.\xc2\xa0 Pete has an important strategic sense that has been -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s used on Capitol Hill as chief of staff to Senator Daschle, as both the minority leader and the majority leader.\xc2\xa0 He has a keen organizational sense that will be invaluable here as we embark on new challenges based on that two-year organizational plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he not want to be permanent chief of staff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\'s something I think that he and the President are going to have to work through.\xc2\xa0 But the President is pleased with Pete agreeing to do this.\xc2\xa0 And I think they\'re both looking forward to the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President going to campaign for Rahm in Chicago or have any --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe any -- I don\'t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I mean, obviously, the President was -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard what the President said over the past several weeks and what the President said today about Rahm and his next endeavors.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President consider Pete Rouse as on a short list of candidates for a permanent replacement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there -- does such a short list exist right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Pete is in -- Pete is, again, as I mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s a reorganizational process that -- part of the natural process with turnover here that Pete\xe2\x80\x99s heading.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, simply because Pete has the -- is the chief of staff, but only on an interim basis now, does certainly not -- certainly does not preclude him being a permanent chief of staff at a later date.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s a completely different subject -- Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The main Shiite block in the Iraqi parliament has picked Maliki as the nominee for -- as their nominee for prime minister, which means he\xe2\x80\x99s on the way to controlling enough seats to form a new government.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to this development, which seems to open the way to a break in the deadlock in the forming of that government?\xc2\xa0 And would there be a concern if there was not a Sunni representation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously, we are -- this is a matter for a very young democracy to figure out.\xc2\xa0 But as -- we were talking about this earlier today and as somebody said, politics is breaking out in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- this is what young democracies go through to form a government, a representative government of the people.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we are helping and assisting in any way we can with this process, but these are decisions that have to be made by the Iraqis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the administration want to see, as it has said before, a broad-based Iraqi --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think the -- a government that represents everybody is what -- is what everybody here is focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden has a new tape out.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one in which he calls on Muslims to give charity to victims of the Pakistani floods.\xc2\xa0 This new approach, this new kind of message that he\xe2\x80\x99s been putting out, comes at the same time that officials are worried about a Mumbai-style attack being plotted by al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if you guys had any comment on the new tape, any comment on his new propaganda effort?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specifically on the tape.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our government and -- has done quite a bit in terms of aid and help in what were obviously very tragic events and tragic floods in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We understand that that is an important part of our bilateral relationship, ensuring that assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into threats and what have you, except to say that obviously the President is updated and has been an active participant in meetings -- is an active participant in meetings every week dealing with whatever information we have and insists on that information being shared and ensuring that every department has whatever it may or may not need to deal with the crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on Pete Rouse.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, first of all, if you could talk about his -- or explain why he\xe2\x80\x99s a registered voter in Alaska.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not a registered voter --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a registered voter in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he did vote absentee ballot in Alaska in 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.\xc2\xa0 I know -- talking to Pete yesterday, he voted, I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who he voted for, but he voted in the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s race here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And Governor Palin -- former Governor Palin has insinuated that Rouse -- she suspected Rouse was part of a plot against her.\xc2\xa0 She wrote about this in her book.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s tweeted about -- tweeted suggestions about this recently.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if you guys have any comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly silly accusation that is baseless.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he had nothing to do with any of the -- okay, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could follow up on the bin Laden tape, does the administration believe that the tape is authentic, that that is a message from bin Laden?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am responding to the reports that it is.\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I have not seen the back and forth on authentification.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what does the administration think about the fact that this is not a message calling for jihad, but rather talking about the need for relief, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s famine or poverty or the Pakistani people that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re -- and this is not addressed at one person.\xc2\xa0 But as we have said, and as the President has said on multiple occasions, I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is lost on the greater Muslim world that those that have perverted that great religion have harmed and killed more of their own religion than of anybody else.\xc2\xa0 I think that speaks volumes and maybe their new tack speaks volumes of the fact that they are very much losing the battle for hearts and minds among the Muslim people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on Iraq, the Washington Post reports it\xe2\x80\x99s 208 days that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a coalition -- have not been able to get a coalition government together.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that there is going to be a threshold, a timetable in which the Iraqi people are going to give up on the process, are going to feel as if this is -- the election wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because -- look, obviously there is a functioning caretaking government that makes governmental decisions.\xc2\xa0 But look, this is -- these are the pushes and pulls that a young democracy goes through.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody is under the illusion that democracy is just an election.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, not only is there an election, you get to formation, but there is formation and then there is government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this, I think, is just what young democracies go through.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have spent quite a bit of time, and the Vice President in particular, in doing what we can to assist that process, understanding that the Iraqis and the Iraqis alone need to make these big decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Pakistan more broadly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the recent missile strike that has caused so much difficulty.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the floods that have caused so much instability.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got reports that the military may try to install a new President.\xc2\xa0 Are we at a point of -- are we at a point or near a point of crisis in Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 Is the administration ready to sound the alarm here, or are these reports overblown?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I would say, Chip, that obviously we are all understanding of -- Pakistan is located in a dangerous neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 Obviously everybody understands the concerns that we have and now the concerns that the Pakistanis have in dealing with extremists in lawless areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tPakistan is an important strategic partner and a key ally to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the government of Pakistan is committed to democracy and to the preservation of civilian leadership, obviously which we believe is tremendously important.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, you mentioned a series of events.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work with our ally in ensuring we can do whatever is possible to assist them in their fight against those extremists that, again, not just threaten us, but threaten the existence of their own government in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the administration sent any signals to Pakistan about these reports that the military may try --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see what specifically --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to potentially engineer a coup, putting another --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I know that Ambassador Patterson, who the President receives weekly updates and is involved in all of the Situation Room discussions around the Afghanistan/Pakistan -- not just the review, but the monthly meetings.\xc2\xa0 Let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that she or the State Department have in terms of specific recent dialogue with the Pakistanis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Pete Rouse, is he actually going to move into Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Sounds pretty permanent to me.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sweet office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he could stay in his office and use that as a conference room.\xc2\xa0 But by moving there, is that sending a signal that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99d be a palatial conference room, but -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be around a while?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look -- you know, Pete -- look, Pete may just -- regardless of whether the timeline is for several months or several years, Pete is the chief of staff.\xc2\xa0 He has -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with Pete since 2004.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve known him longer than that.\xc2\xa0 There isn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody in here that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have tremendous amount of respect for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would tell you, one of the great testaments to Pete, if I can share a little aside of who he is as a person, I went to see Pete right before this on a couple of questions I had.\xc2\xa0 And there were younger staffers that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily always be seated in the chief of staff\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not to -- that\'s not a knock on any chief of staff, it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a busy job.</p>\n<p>\n\tPete prides himself on the mentoring of young staff.\xc2\xa0 And I remember as -- when Pete and I worked together in then-Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s office in early 2005, there was a steady stream of these young staffers coming in and out of his office, because he\xe2\x80\x99d committed in a big Senate operation in Senator Daschle\xe2\x80\x99s office, who\xe2\x80\x99d lost reelection, to do everything he could to find every kid that worked for him the next job.</p>\n<p>\n\tPete is selfless.\xc2\xa0 Pete is -- in everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever dealt with him on, has always put the organization ahead of himself.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that the President reveres in him -- his loyalty to him.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why he enjoys the President\xe2\x80\x99s complete trust.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you went in to him to ask a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Could you share those questions and answers with us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wanted to -- I knew I was going to get asked about some reorganization, some timeline stuff, and I wanted to make sure that I understood it as he understood it.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had that ability with Rahm; I\'ll always have that ability with Pete.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I think what Pete -- Pete is a -- Pete, as I said, is just -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a great respect for Pete amongst the people that have worked here.\xc2\xa0 And I think part of that is, Pete\xe2\x80\x99s in those morning meetings; Pete is in a senior advisors -- every senior advisors meetings that\xe2\x80\x99s in the Oval Office; Pete is -- has been intimately involved in strategic decisions dealing with Congress in order to get big pieces of legislation through.\xc2\xa0 Pete has been, as you heard the President discuss -- we joke that Pete has -- Pete gets the file on Friday of the problem that nobody wanted and sort of it\xe2\x80\x99s lunchtime on Friday and Pete has three hours before the close of business to solve it.\xc2\xa0 And we joke that, \xe2\x80\x9cPete, it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday.\xc2\xa0 Clear your afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Pete has been somebody who --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What problems?\xc2\xa0 What does he solve?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just different bureaucratic problems, different -- just different -- the back-and-forth of governing.\xc2\xa0 But Pete is somebody who is trusted to handle anything and everything, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s got everything.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to remain behind the scenes, or do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to come out and be on the Sunday talk shows and that kind of stuff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will tell you what I told somebody yesterday who wanted an interview with Pete.\xc2\xa0 I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got good news and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got bad news.\xc2\xa0 I said the bad news is Pete won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing an interview with you.\xc2\xa0 I said the good news is he won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing an interview with anybody else.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So you won\xe2\x80\x99t get scooped.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, Pete is -- Pete\xe2\x80\x99s a behind-the-scenes guy.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate, in all honesty, that that changes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way he\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the way he\xe2\x80\x99s been for decades of government service.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are we safe in assuming that the President is hoping Pete will like the job more than Pete thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll like the job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good way of phrasing it.\xc2\xa0 No, look, Pete is -- again, the President has had several occasions to talk to Pete about this over the last little bit, and Pete is -- Pete may not come out and say it, but I think Pete is excited about this and I think Pete is, given his strategic sense and his organizational sense and his trust -- the trust the President has in him, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly situated and capable of doing a great job.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll all help him make sure that happens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that part of today\xe2\x80\x99s event was a public endorsement of Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for mayor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, the President -- well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well known how the President feels about Rahm and how he feels about his ability to make some tough decisions and govern a city like Chicago that\'s going to have some tough decisions to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it was testament to the service that Rahm has provided the President, that he\xe2\x80\x99s provided us, and has provided this country, in serving this President, that I think he deserved everything that was said today.\xc2\xa0 We have -- as I said before, we begin each day and we end each day, as the President does, with -- usually in his office.\xc2\xa0 And he has been a tireless advocate for this President and in getting done what this President wants to get done.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have no information on political endorsements, but I think you know how the President feels about Rahm and his ability to do the job of mayor of Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any concern about alienating other longtime friends, supporters in Chicago who want that job, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people who have gotten dressed over the past several weeks and looked in the mirror and saw the mayor.\xc2\xa0 But look, again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s words were fitting of the service that Rahm has provided to him, to the staff and to the country over a pretty tumultuous 20 months.\xc2\xa0 Rahm gave up -- Rahm did not come to this -- some of us, we were on the campaign, and the next thing we were likely to do is to come here.\xc2\xa0 Rahm wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on that track.\xc2\xa0 Rahm had to give up and sacrifice a lot -- as you heard the President discuss today -- not just personally but obviously what his family had to give up.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President is remarkably grateful for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick one on another topic.\xc2\xa0 You got a stimulus report coming out today.\xc2\xa0 For TV folks, can you talk a little bit about what the report suggests to you, and what you draw from it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the report is going to discuss a couple of things -- first and foremost that -- and the President was briefed on this at the economic daily briefing yesterday, along with a report on AIG and TARP -- and that is we have -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve met the legal deadlines that are set out in the law, that Congress set out in the law.\xc2\xa0 We met our own deadline for ensuring that the money that was appropriated was gotten into the economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on track to create the jobs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said that, CBO has said that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss a little bit about the importance of what the Recovery Act has meant to increase economic growth, to job growth, and I think also two other things.\xc2\xa0 One, that -- I think the number was 0.2 percent of their -- if you look at the number of projects and the number of complaints, it\xe2\x80\x99s about 0.2 percent.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that amount of funding has ever been spent with less complaint than what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think there is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a practical impact as well in what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that Republicans proposed in their pledge.\xc2\xa0 It guarantees rolling back what is left to be spent in the Recovery Act will stop important projects dead in their tracks, like clean energy projects.\xc2\xa0 It will stop tax relief for 110 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 And for folks that talk about not wanting to raise taxes, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what that pledge would do and make some -- make some tough cuts in programs like education that we know are so incredibly vital for preparing the students of today for the jobs of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the stimulus been a success?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the American public seem to grasp that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the stimulus has been a success.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s created jobs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s created economic growth.\xc2\xa0 It has turned our economy from one -- as you heard the President discuss today in the -- close to slipping into the brink of another Great Depression into one that is moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think there is no doubt that people are -- and are right to be -- continually frustrated by the fact that our economic progress, though headed in the right direction, is not fast enough.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do what we can to strengthen that recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did Rahm tell the President he was leaving?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- what\xe2\x80\x99s today, Friday?\xc2\xa0 I believe he told him officially on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, they have -- this is a -- Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s next steps and his decision is something that obviously he and the President have talked about since the mayor surprised everybody, including the President and Rahm, in making his announcement not to seek reelection.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite effusive about Pete Rouse.\xc2\xa0 But to those who would say this is a White House that fears outsiders and is too insular and the choice of Pete Rouse just demonstrates that, what\xe2\x80\x99s your response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact date in which Mayor Daley said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t running for reelection, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an awful short period of time to bring somebody in midstream to do that job.\xc2\xa0 I think Pete will take over some functions that Rahm has had.\xc2\xa0 But Pete has had overlapping functionability in the chief of staff\xe2\x80\x99s job for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 I mean, to get to Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s office, you walk into a set of offices where, if you turn one direction, you end up in Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s, and in the other direction, you end up in Pete\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 So I think that Pete is well suited for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a government study revealed today about human experiments done on Guatemalan citizens in the 1940s.\xc2\xa0 Secretaries Clinton and Sebelius have apologized.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his reaction, and will he add his apology to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has been briefed.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is shocking.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s tragic.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s reprehensible.\xc2\xa0 These are -- I know there was a call, a briefing call that was done on this out of the Department of State.\xc2\xa0 This is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s tragic, and the United States, by all means, apologizes to all those that were impacted by this.\xc2\xa0 The President is slated to call the leader of Guatemala later today and personally express that apology.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It happened in the 1940s, but does it hurt America now to have a story like this come out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it -- obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s tragic and has impacted many.\xc2\xa0 But I think we have dealt with it in a way that --- we were brought this information and acted on this information.\xc2\xa0 I think the apology is one that is well deserved.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us anything more about the meeting with the President\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Recovery Advisory Board on Monday?\xc2\xa0 Is there any particular subject there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that with me, Jonathan, but I will shoot it out to you as soon as I get back.\xc2\xa0 I think -- it was on my desk but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it with me.\xc2\xa0 I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be talking a little bit about some of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear on community colleges dealing with the challenge of creating a skilled workforce.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Giannoulias fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to say anything about this Green Party candidate who is getting something like 6 to 8 percent of the vote in Illinois?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that he can do about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will find out the answer to get you one of those.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know off the top of my head, Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President met yesterday with Democratic leaders.\xc2\xa0 Does he think there\xe2\x80\x99s any point in calling Republican leaders here for a similar meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was talking with, as you mentioned, Democratic leaders to talk about certainly the next few weeks as we head into an important election, but also what still remains on the calendar -- and I mentioned some of that yesterday -- that has to get done.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings on a planning schedule with Republicans between now and then.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that there will be -- there may well be meetings before we head into session in mid-November.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bridge-burning going on between the White House and Republican leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, with the words President Obama uses in his fundraising speeches and his political speeches, denouncing the Republicans as obstructionist, holding back recovery, holding issues hostage.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those are all things, Mark, that the Republicans have bragged about.\xc2\xa0 I hope that -- I hope the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give it a bad name by mentioning what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell bragged about saying no.\xc2\xa0 John Boehner helped a lobbyist author a pledge that would roll back the Recovery Act and raise people\xe2\x80\x99s taxes.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is just -- the President is in many ways reiterating exactly what Republicans have said themselves on the stump.\xc2\xa0 They want to stop everything from happening.\xc2\xa0 They want to roll back things like Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 They want to roll back the protections that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen put into place as part of health care reform.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same message that Republicans have, and that is, they\'re bragging about slowing everything down and we\xe2\x80\x99re mentioning that that\'s what they\'re doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they\'re drinking Slurpees.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to find the Slurpee answer.\xc2\xa0 I know this one has lodged close to your heart, and I will -- (laughter) -- like I said, I tried my best to get him off the tater tots, I get it, and now I got to address Slurpees.\xc2\xa0 And that might just brighten the President\xe2\x80\x99s day to go talk about that this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pete Rouse was charged with closing Guantanamo and that\'s one area where the President has said the administration has fallen short.\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it been accomplished, and will he continue to focus on it?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the latest?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was one of the projects that Pete was given.\xc2\xa0 I think it was safe to say that there was -- there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as strong a process around seeing that come to fruition as there needed to be.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s generally the type of things that Pete fixes the best.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, it is -- we always knew this was going to be hard.\xc2\xa0 And we have met resistance even among Republicans that, before the President decided that we would close it, actually supported closing it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Pete will have this directly in his portfolio given the fact that now Pete has a little bit in every portfolio.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Pete was brought in to create and ensure that we had a good process around that.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been -- it\xe2\x80\x99s worked much better since.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a lot of regret about not being able to finish that task?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t -- the door is not closed on finishing that task.\xc2\xa0 That is -- if you ask counterterrorism experts, if you ask our commanders in the field, they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that that is -- that Guantanamo Bay prison is a recruiting call that echoes around the world for extremism.\xc2\xa0 It is used in recruiting new individuals to that effort, and the President remains committed to ensuring that they will soon not be able to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And counterterrorism officials say they believe Osama bin Laden was involved in this latest terror plot on European cities.\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, not anything that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to discuss publicly.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I think you said the President was briefed on TARP as well as the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Geithner gave a speech to some Treasury employees a couple of weeks ago about TARP and how history would view it, compared to how it\xe2\x80\x99s viewed by the public today.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on how TARP\xe2\x80\x99s going to be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I talked about yesterday, and I have not -- I did not look at stock prices today, but if you take AIG converting into common shares of stock, selling that stock would net this government, as of yesterday morning, a $20 billion profit on its investment in AIG.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, that is -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not walking way out on a limb to say that was not the conventional wisdom.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Most people, I think, in their accounting of the Troubled Asset Relief Program was that -- that that money was gone.\xc2\xa0 The briefing the President received reiterated that financial institutions -- the investment made through TARP in the financial institutions is likely to yield a profit, and that what we estimated TARP would cost last August, we\xe2\x80\x99re at roughly one-tenth of that cost today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I will say -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a minute to brag -- this is not an accident.\xc2\xa0 I think if you take some of the steps that were taken today at AIG or some of the steps that were taken at places like GM and Chrysler, this was not -- and this was -- this created a bit of a stir, but this was not money to meet a balance sheet for money\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xc2\xa0 This required some very, very tough cultural changes inside the company, management changes inside of a company.\xc2\xa0 And it changed the way these companies were operating, because they were not operating in a way that provided assurance to anybody that they\xe2\x80\x99d be here for long.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd instead of handing out money and perpetuating a series of bad practices, for instance in the auto companies, we made investments to ensure the jobs of millions of those who work not only in auto facilities, but in auto part manufacturing, that if you visit an auto plant or are normally situated fairly close to those plants -- to save those jobs, but to ensure that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t just handing out a check that in three months they\xe2\x80\x99d need to come back for another; that we\xe2\x80\x99d institute the type of management changes that now find companies back making a profit again and that are much healthier than when the President assumed office 20 months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is TARP such a political poison?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that people know a lot of what I just said.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll help tell it.\xc2\xa0 I hope -- I hope everyone will too, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the conventional wisdom.\xc2\xa0 AIG alone was -- like I said, that -- most people put on the tally sheet, just put $180 billion in that column over there, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll never see that back.\xc2\xa0 Now, we know we\xe2\x80\x99re -- again, it will take some time to sell the common stock; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s all going to get sold tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty big chunk of money.\xc2\xa0 But I think we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to end that with a profit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI saw a release before I came out here on shares of Citigroup that netted a profit.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken important steps to ensure the management changes, but also to create an economy where companies like that can function and make a profit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That AIG and Citigroup are doing well, does that suggest that they would have done well anyway, that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need necessarily to be bailed out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand that GM and Chrysler, without government help, you\xe2\x80\x99d buy -- you\xe2\x80\x99d go see a new GM and a Chrysler somewhere in the Smithsonian.\xc2\xa0 AIG, again, was a very successful insurance company that somebody had the bright idea of attaching a hedge fund on top of, which turned out to be a $180 billion bad decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I do not think that, left completely to their own devices, these companies would have seen -- necessarily seen a turnaround.\xc2\xa0 I think there were some important management decisions that we impacted because of that investment.\xc2\xa0 And because of that, we see companies that are moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 You see taxpayers that will recoup their money and then some.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important story for everybody to understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just -- going back to Rouse a little bit -- could you talk a little bit about how you see the White House changing with Rouse in place in terms of strategy or culture or atmosphere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, as the President mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s a personality difference in Pete and Rahm.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the understatement of the day.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat having been said, look, again, Pete is -- Pete\xe2\x80\x99s been very involved in this organization and with this President since late 2004.\xc2\xa0 Pete was -- I remember having dinner with Pete and then Senator-elect Obama, and the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s two lists for chief of staff in my Senate office.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the only name on one list and there\xe2\x80\x99s a bunch of names on the second list.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tPete was an important -- has been an important part of this for more than six years.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in a lot that\xe2\x80\x99s -- almost everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happened here -- the strategic, the tactical.\xc2\xa0 So I think in many ways you\xe2\x80\x99ll see important continuity over the next several months, which is important to the functioning of how this place works.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another Rouse question, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In thinking about the shape of the White House and personnel decisions, does the election play a role?\xc2\xa0 Will the outcome of the elections kind of determine what kind of people he\xe2\x80\x99d want to bring into the White House, including the new chief of staff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It certainly could.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to divine three or four or five weeks away.\xc2\xa0 Again, as we discussed yesterday, there was -- there is always natural turnover in an administration.\xc2\xa0 We were seeing that natural turnover.\xc2\xa0 And Pete was charged with organizing for the next two years, regardless of an outcome in an election, what has to be put in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have no doubt that many -- some of the decisions about that staff reorganization will take into account what happens -- ultimately happen in an election, even as we begin now to identify a cast of people that can fill Dr. Summers\xe2\x80\x99 job at NEC or other jobs around the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is a lot of people in Washington, Republicans and Democrats, are saying that the White House needs a new face, and will it need one even more so to deal with what is likely to be a strengthened Republican presence, if not a Republican majority on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Pete doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really provide that new face.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s, as you just said, continuity.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but I don\'t -- I guess -- well, I don\'t know if you can break down --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you address that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if you can break down sort of what you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Is that mainly on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 Because, look, Pete is -- Pete\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly well known quantity up there.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of people on the Democratic and Republican side have dealt with Pete for -- dealt with him as the chief of staff for Senator Daschle for 10 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those that are still there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those that are still there, but there\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are a decent amount that are still there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, Pete was on -- Pete was a Senate staffer through part of 2007, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not that long ago that he was up there.\xc2\xa0 Again, look, we will -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got several weeks to go before an election.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, without knowing the results, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to divine what the message might be, so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the expectation, though, that a decision on chief of staff will -- on a permanent chief of staff will be made once the election is over?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that that will be made in any way prior to the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does Pete have a set time for which he is -- plans to serve as interim as far as --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a timeframe in mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- I don\'t anticipate anything happening -- I don\'t think anything happens there for the next several months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Pete Rouse have a meeting with the congressional leaders yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that, but I can check.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be part of his portfolio?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what did the President tell the leaders, in terms of holding down the tax rates on the middle class -- what he calls the middle class extension?\xc2\xa0 Did he make it clear that he wants that, even if he has to give on something else?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the meeting yesterday.\xc2\xa0 It was during the briefing.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I mean, obviously the President reiterated, and I will double-check on the tax question, but reiterated his position on ensuring that the middle-class tax cuts not expire, but that the cost of having that happen isn\xe2\x80\x99t $700 billion in tax cuts for people who don\'t need it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is the administration prepared to do after the election to make sure that that happens?\xc2\xa0 Is there any danger that Congress will not act to extend the current tax cut?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that may be a better question for Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I think that this President -- I think his position is fairly well known.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some time to deal with that in mid-November when the Senate and the House come back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I mentioned yesterday, and I think the readout said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- there are a number of issues that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to deal with.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got children\xe2\x80\x99s nutrition; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got obviously the tax stuff; there is a very important START treaty that needs to get -- that\'s passed through the committee with important bipartisan support, and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see it -- and expect it -- that it will be passed by the full Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried about the lame-duck session?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Worried how?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Worried in that he might not have the same political dynamics -- he\xe2\x80\x99s got the same members of Congress, but depending on the outcome of the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, tell me what it feels like that morning and I can probably answer that question, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to do that in more than a month before that.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, at this United Nations meeting last week, the Prime Minister of India was not among the world leaders because he was preparing for the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to India.\xc2\xa0 What India is expecting from the United States or from President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s visit to India?\xc2\xa0 Is that India\xe2\x80\x99s seat on the United Nations Security Council -- that India deserves to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracy on the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 But what does you think United States\xe2\x80\x99 or President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s expectation from India, as far as war in Afghanistan and also situation in the region?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously that\'s kind of a series of broad questions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on the Security Council stuff, Goyal.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I anticipate that the world economy and our bilateral business relationships with India will be an important aspect of that trip.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd from a security standpoint, obviously Afghanistan and Pakistan and how that is all interrelated in that area of Asia, particularly with India, will be a big focus of what the President discusses with the prime minister then.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as the Osama bin Laden status is concerned and situation in Pakistan, we have not seen anything in the last couple of years, videotapes from him anymore, only the audio tapes once in awhile.\xc2\xa0 And also, the situation in Pakistan is really quite bad because the flood came in a messy way; so did the corruption.\xc2\xa0 And the people of Pakistan are now fed up with the present government and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I doubt they\xe2\x80\x99ll be comforted in getting the aid that is necessary from somebody that is not showing their face to the world.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be comforted by the relationship, the bilateral relationship they have with this country, that has no problem standing up here or standing up anywhere in the world and pledging our commitment and assistance to help its people in a tragic time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGlenn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you mentioned that there was a short runway for Rahm to depart the White House.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be involved on a continuing basis in any decisions, consulting with the President?\xc2\xa0 And will he retain his security clearance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to the second one.\xc2\xa0 But I can -- I will try to find out that question.\xc2\xa0 Look, in terms of -- look, I think the President will always listen and -- listen to the insightful and candid opinions that Rahm has shared with the President and with staff here for 20 months, as you heard him say.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, Rahm is going on to what is charitably a fairly busy endeavor, it appears, next.\xc2\xa0 So my guess is that his focus will be on that, as it should be. The President has -- I don\'t want to take anything away from what the President said in terms of the friendship that he shares with Rahm and what he\xe2\x80\x99s meant to the staff and what he\xe2\x80\x99s meant to this President in getting things done.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will check on security.\xc2\xa0 I honestly have no idea how that works.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned that the -- you mentioned that Pete is going to take over Rahm\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 Does he inherit that people-tracking system?\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t Rahm have like a staff-tracking system that he --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It usually involved yelling, but I don\'t know what -- (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is so and so?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that was a fancy intercom that Rahm had installed or whether it was -- no, I will --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was electronic implants involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they take the chip out of you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve neither a bracelet on my ankle or on my wrist that would denote my current location.\xc2\xa0 But, look, we -- as I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a group of us that start every day in that office, regardless of who that person is.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be there Monday morning at 7:30 a.m., as we have every day for the past 20 months.\xc2\xa0 And, you know, we --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Rahm finishing his day today?\xc2\xa0 In other words, is today his last day?\xc2\xa0 Or is it Sunday?\xc2\xa0 Or what is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I believe today is his last day.\xc2\xa0 And I think there will be some -- a little celebration for him later today up in the residence before he goes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cooking the fish?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The fish was Austan\xe2\x80\x99s idea.\xc2\xa0 It was -- it stunk.\xc2\xa0 But it was quite a funny way to -- for two people from Chicago to say good-bye.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is it now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the special at the mess.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 On the menu it said -- I think it said --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fresh.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it said -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not responsible for this joke; I\xe2\x80\x99ll give credit to Jon Favreau -- it was supposed to be \xe2\x80\x9cEast Meets West Fish Tacos,\xe2\x80\x9d and Jon said that they\xe2\x80\x99d already updated the board to \xe2\x80\x9cEast Meets Midwest Fish Tacos\xe2\x80\x9d -- (laughter) -- $10.95.\xc2\xa0 I have not eaten yet, and it will not be the fish tacos.</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Robert, since you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that this departure is part of the natural rhythm of history here at the White House, are people casually talking to the President now about the possibilities of departures beyond the situation?\xc2\xa0 Are yourself and others possibly talking about \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to stay on about\xe2\x80\x9d -- casually?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I certainly have not had the conversation with the President.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, honestly, April, if others have.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to make -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to deliver that answer knowing -- not knowing, honestly, what other people have talked to the President about.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say this.\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a day of kind of extraordinary staff changes anytime a chief of staff comes and goes.\xc2\xa0 But the to-do list that we have today, that we have Saturday and Sunday, will be largely the same that we have on Monday.\xc2\xa0 So in many ways I don\xe2\x80\x99t see operationally a lot changing.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we have the same series of challenges that are before us.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in other administrations they would say -- they would send out a message, now is the time; if you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to leave, you need to make your decisions known.\xc2\xa0 Is this that time here in this administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, April, I think each individual has to -- individuals themselves are going to have to make those decisions based on their individual circumstances --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But organizationally, is this that time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think naturally it is.\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I have not seen or heard a broader call for making a decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, honestly, you need an email or what to understand that there -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve characterized it, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very natural cycle to this, and two years has in many ways -- is in many ways a breaking point in that cycle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, following up from my question to you yesterday, I asked about the protests this weekend and I know that civil rights leaders have been talking.\xc2\xa0 I know that civil rights leaders have been talking to people here at the White House, staffers here at the White House, about the event this weekend.\xc2\xa0 And you addressed the issue of the economy, but you never specifically addressed the protest itself.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to me about the protest?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t honestly know that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to broadly, April, change my answer from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think there is -- we have gone through the most tumultuous economic time for virtually everybody in this country -- historic depths of job loss, of economic retraction.\xc2\xa0 It is important to note that we are heading now in a different direction.\xc2\xa0 We are making progress.\xc2\xa0 The economy is strengthening.\xc2\xa0 Is it strengthening as fast as we would like it to?\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at the same time, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t under the misimpression that somehow taking a job loss from -- adding the job loss in recessions in 1981, 1991, and 2001 was somehow going to be easy, since if neither of those three was easy to get out of, how would adding all of them together be easy to get out of?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 The economy has gone through some very deep and fundamental shifts.\xc2\xa0 We have seen not just job loss, but a housing crisis, a financial stability crisis -- all happened simultaneously.\xc2\xa0 That is -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve described it and I think many others have, as in many ways a perfect storm of economic disaster.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But with this perfect storm, the perfect storm is being led -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but the perfect storm is being led by people who are friendly with this administration, civil rights leaders that the President talks to, black community leaders who will be marching in this demonstration.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re marching not just about this issue, but they\xe2\x80\x99re marching about education, justice, and jobs, and they\xe2\x80\x99re also talking about Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 But what do you specifically say about that?\xc2\xa0 Your allies are marching for something that you guys are not putting out yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I will take our record on any of the topics that you just mentioned, over the past 20 months, and compare them to the 20 months before that and feel very comfortable with that comparison.\xc2\xa0 We lost more than 8.5 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get fixed overnight.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get fixed over a lot of nights.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a long time.\xc2\xa0 If it was a simple problem, it would have been solved before we got here.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 When we got here, things were going drastically in the wrong direction.\xc2\xa0 The President made some important steps, some courageous steps, to turn that around.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say this about our education.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a focus of a lot of activity this week.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President talk about it.\xc2\xa0 I will put our record of education reform up against that of any administration at any economic time.\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Duncan and what President Obama have been able to do in getting states to make decisions to strengthen their standards is once-in-a-lifetime reform.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important because it matters to the types of families that get raised, the type of economy we have, the type of income that they have.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill handed me a note, Glenn, that says, \xe2\x80\x9cRahm will not maintain his clearance, secretary clearance, as of departure today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No more Secret Service either, as of the end of the day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Will you Google that too?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll take one more, Bill, and Stephen and then -- yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the midterms, the President the last couple of appearances has talked about the enthusiasm gap.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe in an enthusiasm gap and is he worried about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think anybody that reads a poll can know that -- if you look at some polls, some Republicans are more excited about the upcoming elections than Democrats.\xc2\xa0 I will say, if you look at -- I mean, the NBC poll this week showed a lessening in the generic ballot and a lessening in that enthusiasm gap as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So his message to independents and Democrats about the midterms who might be inclined to sit it out is what?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Get involved.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too important not to.\xc2\xa0 Everything that -- everything they care about is at stake.\xc2\xa0 The direction of our economy is at stake.\xc2\xa0 The direction of our foreign policy is at stake.\xc2\xa0 We have -- you have -- people have an important stake in the outcome of this election.</p>\n<p>\n\tStephen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a week since the President gave his speech at the U.N. focusing a lot on the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about what he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing personally since then to try to keep the talks going and whether there was a letter to Netanyahu, a memo or whatever?\xc2\xa0 Have you been willing to lay out to the Israelis particularly what kind of incentives they can expect to see for concluding a deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our special envoy George Mitchell has been in the region over the past several days, met with Abbas, met with Netanyahu, met with the parties.\xc2\xa0 We were disappointed at the news of the expiration of the moratorium last Sunday.\xc2\xa0 That does not, though, dampen our resolve to continue to move this process along.\xc2\xa0 The parties that came here several weeks ago came here and demonstrated a genuine seriousness in getting something done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat remains our mission.\xc2\xa0 The President had a meeting -- right before I came down here, was meeting with Secretary of State Clinton to get an update from the region.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s obviously -- she and envoy -- special envoy George Mitchell are point on our negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And we understand that there are -- there will be hurdles along the way to a comprehensive and important peace.\xc2\xa0 We will seek to get over each one of those hurdles as they come, and keep the direct talks moving along with the sense of purposefulness that we witnessed here and have witnessed in subsequent talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
