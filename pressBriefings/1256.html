WIT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT YUDHOYONO:\xc2\xa0 (As translated.)\xc2\xa0 Your Excellency, President Barack Obama, today Indonesia has the honor of welcoming the state visit fulfilling my invitation to him.\xc2\xa0 It is my hope that this visit that we have been waiting for so long by the people of Indonesia, can further enhance the relations between Indonesia and the cooperation between Indonesia and the United States in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s state visit this time, it also coincides -- we are launching the Comprehensive Partnership that we hope with this partnership all forms of cooperation between our governments can be enhanced in a concrete manner in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe both agreed to enhance, increase cooperation in various fields with the specific agenda and specific priority that we wish to enhance -- that is in the area of trade and investment, in the area of education, energy, in the area of climate change and the environment, in the area of security and democracy and also civil society.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe earnestly hope that this partnership that we establish, that we can look to the future and this partnership may build upon people-to-people relations between our two great nations\xc2\xa0 and furthermore, can contribute to the creation of global peace, stability, and the economy, be it at the regional or at the global level.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLadies and gentlemen, there are many issues that we discussed earlier at the bilateral meeting, but I wish to convey a number of elements that became the commitment of both our governments -- commitment of the United States and the Republic of Indonesia -- to truly enhance and to build upon in the future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFirst of all is in the area of trade and investment.\xc2\xa0 At this time, the United States is the trade partner number three for Indonesia, with $21 billion in 2008, and also investor number three for Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 We hope that -- and I personally expect that -- once again, the investment and trade between our two countries can be increased significantly in the future, bearing in mind that the magnitude of the economies of the United States and also the economic growth that is occurring in Indonesia right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe also discussed and agreed to enhance cooperation in the area of energy, especially clean energy, and invite the U.S. to participate in the development of geothermal energy that is also one of Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s great sources of renewable energy and a high number of deposits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe also discussed the opportunity to cooperate in the area of climate change, environment, and also management of the forest.\xc2\xa0 Indonesia possesses the responsibility to manage our forests, to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas effects from the forest.\xc2\xa0 We also have a target to reduce 26 percent of our emissions by 2020, with the cooperation of the international community, the United States and Indonesia, as developing country and developed country. Therefore, our hopes to attain this kind of commitment will contribute significantly and play an effective role.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt is our need to underscore the cooperation in education sector.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, I thanked President Barack Obama for his assistance and cooperation all this time in the area of education.\xc2\xa0 When we met in Toronto in June, the United States assisted $100 million to the development of education in Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 This is a pillar of great importance for people-to-people contact, for cooperation between our two great nations, Comprehensive Partnership that we possess right now.\xc2\xa0 We agreed to enhance this cooperation in the area of education in the future.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe also underscored the importance of cooperation in the area of counterterrorism, where terrorism is an enemy for all nations and we must and we desire to strengthen cooperation in the context of law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 In this regard, it will be an effective focus in the efforts to eradicate acts of terrorism.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLadies and gentlemen, we also discussed global and regional issues of common concern. Among others, the future of the relations between ASEAN and the United States, the future of the East Asia Summit, and also cooperation in regional -- in the context of APEC, we both agreed to discuss efforts to ensure stability and security and peace in our region -- specific Asia Pacific, including in the area of Asia, which currently is facing a lot of focus on many shifts in geopolitics in the recent times.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI conveyed to President Obama that Indonesia will chair ASEAN in 2011, and therefore, as host of the East Asia Summit, we invite Obama to attend the meeting with other leaders in the East Asia Summit, including the President of Russia, to together we discuss matters on the issue of security in our region, specifically Asia Pacific.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd we also discussed the issue of G20 where we must continue to promote G20 as a premier forum for international economic cooperation, so that efforts to develop global economic growth that is strong, balanced, and sustainable can be achieved. And also we must secure the balance of the global economy so that it will bring benefit to all humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe also see the issue of Myanmar and hope that the process of democratization in Myanmar that is currently taking place as promised by the government of Myanmar will take place in a good way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLast but not least, we also discussed the issue of the situation in the Middle East, including the issue of Palestine and Israel.\xc2\xa0 And also I conveyed the His Excellency that the position of Indonesia is clear that we need a resolution on Palestine-Israel in a permanent, sustainable manner, a two-state solution and independence for the people of Palestine who are living in peace with the people of Israel, and must be supported by the international community.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLadies and gentlemen, those are the key elements that I wish to convey that we discussed during our bilateral meeting this evening.\xc2\xa0 And it is my big hope from Indonesia that -- and I\'m very optimistic that with the Comprehensive Partnership with the government of the United States and cooperation and partnership between Indonesia and the United States in various fields will receive our effort to enhance and to improve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTherefore, I wish to now invite President Barack Obama to convey his views to the Indonesian press and also to the U.S. press and the participants here.\xc2\xa0 And I also truly hope that once again this framework for cooperation can truly bring benefit be it for the nation of the United States and Indonesia. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI invite you, Mr. Barack. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Selamat sore.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, President Yudhoyono, for your kind words, your gracious welcome and for your friendship and your partnership.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter more than one attempt, it is wonderful to finally be back in Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased that my wife Michelle is joining me for her first visit to the country.\xc2\xa0 I assure you, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be her last.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank the people of Jakarta for the wonderful reception when we arrived.\xc2\xa0 Even in the rain, people were there to greet us.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very appreciative of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOf course, we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful that this is a difficult time for Indonesia -\xe2\x80\x94 first, the recent earthquake and tsunami, and now the volcanic eruptions.\xc2\xa0 And our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost their loved ones or their homes.\xc2\xa0 And I know that President Yudhoyono has been tireless in his efforts to make sure that people are safe and that this difficulty is dealt with in as effective way as possible.\xc2\xa0 And so we are fully supportive of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe United States will continue to support the relief efforts in any way that we can.\xc2\xa0 And I hope that my presence here today is a reminder that, in good times and in bad times, the United States stands as a friend with Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, obviously, much has been made of the fact that this marks my return to where I lived as a young boy.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you, though, that I barely recognized it.\xc2\xa0 As I was driving down the streets, the only building that was there when I first moved to Jakarta was Sarinah.\xc2\xa0 Now it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the shorter buildings on the road.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut today, as President, I\xe2\x80\x99m here to focus not on the past, but on the future \xe2\x80\x94- the Comprehensive Partnership that we\xe2\x80\x99re building between the United States and Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracies, as the largest economy in Southeast Asia and as a member of the G20, as a regional leader, as a vast archipelago on the front lines of climate change, and as a society of extraordinary diversity -- Indonesia is where many of the challenges and the opportunities of the 21st century come together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt the same time, the United States is leading again in Asia.\xc2\xa0 We are strengthening our alliances.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re deepening relationships, as we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with China.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re re-engaging with ASEAN and joining the East Asia summit, and we\xe2\x80\x99re forging new partnerships with emerging powers like Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 So our Comprehensive Partnership is bringing our countries closer together.\xc2\xa0 And I want to focus just on three key areas.\xc2\xa0 And we discussed a wide range of issues during our meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFirst, as President Yudhoyono mentioned, we are looking to expand our trade and investment and commercial relationships because it can create prosperity in both our countries.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTrade between us is growing fast \xe2\x80\x94- and that includes American exports to Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Indonesia is one of the growing markets that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be focused on as part of my initiative to double U.S. exports.\xc2\xa0 President Yudhoyono and I discussed ways to create the conditions that would encourage additional trade and investment.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned that we\xe2\x80\x99re number three right now in terms of trade volume and investment.\xc2\xa0 And I informed him we don\'t like being number three; we want to be number one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing everything we can to expand this trading relationship.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to announce that the Oversees Private Investment Corporation, or OPIC, will host its annual conference this spring in Indonesia to highlight new opportunities for partnership here and across the region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTo strengthen cooperation in science and technology that fuels growth, we are going to be pursuing joint research in areas like energy and biodiversity conversation.\xc2\xa0 And we are expanding educational partnerships between our young scientists, engineers and doctors.\xc2\xa0 And building on the entrepreneurship summit that I hosted in Washington, which was attended by some very talented young Indonesians, I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased that Indonesia will be hosting a regional entrepreneurship conference next year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs we prepare for the G20 and APEC summits, President Yudhoyono and I discussed the need to ensure that the global economic recovery is strong and balanced and is creating jobs in all of our countries.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s focus number one -- trade, investment, and the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSecond, we\xe2\x80\x99re forging new ties between our people to address common challenges.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re expanding partnerships between our students and our universities.\xc2\xa0 We aim to double the number of educational exchanges between our two countries within five years.\xc2\xa0 And I thank President Yudhoyono\xe2\x80\x99s offer for additional scholarships for young Americans to study in Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful thing that needs to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re proud to support Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s leadership under President Yudhoyono in confronting climate change.\xc2\xa0 I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of rain this year, and obviously we can\xe2\x80\x99t look at one year as indicative of the future but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that as an archipelago, Indonesia will be on the front lines when it comes to the potential impacts of climate change. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re glad to work with President Yudhoyono on this issue, and we welcome and will support the new partnership between Indonesia and Norway to slow emissions from deforestation and degradation of peat land. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re bringing on -- we\xe2\x80\x99re building on Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s inspiring transition from dictatorship to democracy by launching a new effort to help Indonesian civil society groups who tackle corruption and promote human rights at home to share their experience with civil society groups across this region, because I think people can learn from the experiences of Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I would note that many of the partnerships I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned are a direct result of my call in Cairo for a new beginning between the United States and Muslim communities around the world.\xc2\xa0 And it involves the private sector as well, thanks to efforts like Partners for a New Beginning, which is forging partnerships around science, education and entrepreneurship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe third element of our Comprehensive Partnership is to deepen our political and security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 As President Yudhoyono mentioned, we\xe2\x80\x99re already enjoying strong cooperation in preventing terrorism, preventing piracy.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s leadership as the chair of ASEAN next year, and I look forward to returning to Jakarta next year for the East Asia Summit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne of the challenges ASEAN and the world will continue to face is Burma, and I commend Indonesia for standing up for the people of Burma and their rights.\xc2\xa0 Last week\xe2\x80\x99s election in Burma was neither free, nor fair.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue our efforts to move Burma toward democratic reform and protection of human rights. As a first step, the Burmese authorities should immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, promoting prosperity, expanding partnerships between our people, and deepening political and security cooperation -- these are the pillars of our new partnership, which owes so much to the leadership of my good friend President Yudhoyono.\xc2\xa0 I believe that our two nations have only begun to forge the cooperation that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 And I say that not simply as someone who knows firsthand what Indonesia can offer the world.\xc2\xa0 I say it as President -- a President who knows what Indonesia and the United States can offer the world together if we work together in a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo terimah kasih dan Assalamualaikum.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good evening, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I speak in Indonesian because Mr. President has been in Jakarta.\xc2\xa0 Lately, Mr. President, the region of Asia Pacific is developing and the development is extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s initiative, cooperation, and there is always promotion to a strategic partnership.\xc2\xa0 What do you think is the role of the U.S. in the configuration of Asia Pacific in the future?\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that President Yudhoyono and I spent a lot of time discussing.\xc2\xa0 Asia is the fastest-growing part of the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the fastest growing in terms of population.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the fastest growing set of economies. And so there\xe2\x80\x99s enormous potential and enormous promise -- but only if countries are cooperating, if they are observing basic rules of the road, if potential conflicts are resolved in a peaceful fashion. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so it\xe2\x80\x99s very important I think to make sure that we have the kinds of multilateral institutions and architecture that can maximize the potential and minimize the challenges of a rapidly changing region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think Indonesia is going to be a critical partner in that, a critical leader in that, primarily because it is a country that has figured out how to create a genuine democracy despite great diversity, and so I think can promote the kinds of values that will help people all across this region maximize their potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see is that even as we continue to work through APEC on economic issues -- it\xe2\x80\x99s primarily an economic organization -- that the East Asia Summit becomes a premier organizational structure to work on political and security issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think under President Yudhoyono\xe2\x80\x99s leadership next year, there\xe2\x80\x99s enormous potential for us to start looking at some specific areas of common interest. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne example that I mentioned in our bilateral meeting was the issue of the South China Sea and how various maritime issues, conflicts, can get resolved in a peaceful fashion.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that everybody has an interest in, everybody has a concern in.\xc2\xa0 But there may be a whole host of other issues like that in which the East Asia Summit is probably the ideal venue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tRegardless of whether we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about APEC or East Asia Summit, or for that matter the G20, Indonesia is going to have a seat at the table.\xc2\xa0 And its leadership is going to be absolutely critical and the United States wants to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re coordinating closely on all these issues of critical concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tCarol Lee of Politico.\xc2\xa0 Where is Carol?\xc2\xa0 There you go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 How would you assess your outreach to the Muslim world at this point in your presidency, particularly in light of some of the controversies back home?\xc2\xa0 And if you could, give us some of your thoughts on what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to return here as President of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And may I, President Yudhoyono?\xc2\xa0 Obviously President Obama spent some time here as a child and I wonder what your thoughts are and what special insights that gives him into the region.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the second question first. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful to be here -- although I have to tell you that when you visit a place that you spent time in as a child, as President it\xe2\x80\x99s a little disorienting.\xc2\xa0 First of all, as I said before, the landscape has changed completely.\xc2\xa0 When I first came here it was in 1967 and people were on becaks -- which for those of you who aren\xe2\x80\x99t familiar, is sort of a bicycle rickshaw thing. And if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t on becaks, they were on bemos, which were -- (laughter) -- they were sort of like little taxis but you stood in the back and it was very crowded.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd now as President, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even see any traffic because they block off all the streets -- (laughter) -- although my understanding is that Jakarta traffic is pretty tough.\xc2\xa0 But I feel great affection for the people here.\xc2\xa0 And obviously I have a sister who\xe2\x80\x99s half Indonesian.\xc2\xa0 My mother lived and worked here for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And so the sights and the sounds and the memories all feel very familiar.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful to be able to come back as President and hopefully contribute to further understanding between the United States and Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s striking is because it\xe2\x80\x99s almost on the exact opposite side of the world, I think not enough Americans know about this great country.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully my visit here will help to promote additional interest and understanding. People have heard of Bali and they\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of Java, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t always know how to locate it on a map back home.\xc2\xa0 And I think that increasing awareness of Indonesia is something I\xe2\x80\x99m very much looking forward to doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tObviously this is a short visit.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a shorter visit than I would like.\xc2\xa0 My hope is, is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to come back and maybe bring the kids and visit some places outside of Jakarta.\xc2\xa0 When you go to -- inland, further into Java, there are just incredible places like Yogya, old ancient temples, and places that I have very fond memories of visiting when I was a kid.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d love to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith respect to outreach to the Muslim world, I think that our efforts have been earnest, sustained.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that we are going to completely eliminate some of the misunderstandings and mistrust that have developed over a long period of time.\xc2\xa0 But we do think that we\xe2\x80\x99re on the right path. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our more active communications to press in Muslim countries, or exchange programs in which we\xe2\x80\x99re having U.S. scientists and other educators visit Muslim countries, or that entrepreneurship summit that we had in Washington in which we invited young business leaders from Muslim countries all across\xc2\xa0 -- all around the world -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is to make sure that we are building bridges and expanding our interactions with Muslim countries so that they\xe2\x80\x99re not solely focused on security issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBecause you come to a place like Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim population in the world, but people here have a lot of other interests, other than security -- that security is important, but I want to make sure that we are interacting with a wide range of people on a wide range of issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think by broadening the relationship, it strengthens it, it builds trust, creates more people-to-people contact.\xc2\xa0 That will be good for our security but it will also be good for the larger cause of understanding between the United States and the Muslim world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an incomplete project.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to eliminate some -- or replace some tough dialogue around concrete policy issues.\xc2\xa0 Those are going to continue.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be some policy differences that we can\xe2\x80\x99t avoid.\xc2\xa0 But I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s helping.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT YUDHOYONO:\xc2\xa0 Could you repeat your questions to me?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you -- obviously, President Obama spent some time here as a child.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder what your thoughts are, and how that gives him special insight into the region.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT YUDHOYONO:\xc2\xa0 I a few times having met with President Barack Obama, up to now one thing that I felt during our meetings, the understanding of the situation in developing countries, an understanding on the issues faced by a country like Indonesia that is often very complex.\xc2\xa0 That makes it possible for President Barack Obama to see in a more clear situation what are the true challenges faced by the developing world.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, the cooperation that we build between Indonesia and the United States, for example, is more precise.\xc2\xa0 He understands more the challenges, the situation and obstacles that is faced by countries like Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat\'s what I really felt when I met with him.\xc2\xa0 And now I, too, can feel more easy to convey to him the issues that we are faced, the challenges faced by Indonesia, and therefore the agenda that we discuss together, including Comprehensive Partnership that we have discussed will be more precise and accurate for the benefit not only for Indonesia, but also for the people of the United States. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good evening, President Obama, and President Yudhoyono.\xc2\xa0 My question is one, and it is to President Obama, regarding to the global economic crisis that still has impacts on the economy of the world today.\xc2\xa0 The President of the United States, you have created a lot of unemployment in this region, East Asia.\xc2\xa0 Do you think this affects the economic cooperation between Indonesia and the United States?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd in the context of the G20, how do you see the effectiveness of the G20 to improving or the recovery efforts in the global economy?\xc2\xa0 Because we still see many challenges faced by countries, especially in the area of currency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that overall the G20 has been very successful in stabilizing the world economy.\xc2\xa0 When you think about where we were when I first entered office and attended my first G20 meeting in April of 2009, at that point, there was great uncertainty as to whether the financial system was going to be melting down around the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe economies of a lot of countries, including the United States, were contracting at a severe pace.\xc2\xa0 I think our economy contracted in that first question by 6 percent.\xc2\xa0 World trade had drastically contracted.\xc2\xa0 And in part because of the effective coordination between the G20 countries -- making sure that countries weren\xe2\x80\x99t resorting to protectionism, coordinating a package of recovery programs that increased world demand, effectively intervening in the banking system and stabilizing it -- because of all those actions, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that countries for the most part around the world are back on a growth pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right that we still have a lot of work to do.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be joining President Yudhoyono in Seoul, South Korea, to discuss the next steps that have to be taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOne of the key steps is putting in place additional tools to encourage balanced and sustainable growth.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons that the crisis was so severe was there were huge imbalances when it comes to surpluses and deficits; our trading patterns were such where there was a lot of money floating around engaged in a lot of speculative activity. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd what we agreed to in previous meetings of the G20 is, is that we need to establish a framework for more balanced growth.\xc2\xa0 We have not yet achieved that balanced growth.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some countries run up very big surpluses and intervening significantly in the currency markets to maintain their advantage when it comes to their currency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got other countries that are in deficit.\xc2\xa0 Both surplus and deficit countries would benefit if there was a more balanced program in which the surplus countries were focused on internal demand, there was a more market-based approach to the currencies, and the deficit countries thereby were able to export more -- and that would also make it easier for them to deal with their unemployment issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo this is going to be something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be discussing extensively in Seoul. I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we can make progress on it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen all at once.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m very much focused on creating a win-win situation in which everybody is invested in expanding world trade, everybody is invested in increased prosperity, but we\xe2\x80\x99re doing so in a way in which everybody is benefitting and not just some.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLast question on our side is Stephen Collinson of AFP.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 As the President mentioned, events in the Middle East are watched very closely here.\xc2\xa0 Does Israel\xe2\x80\x99s advanced planning for more than a thousand new homes in Jerusalem undermine trust between the parties and undermine your peace efforts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd if I may just ask President Yudhoyono, is ASEAN ready for the more advanced role in world affairs the U.S. would like to see it play, and should the U.S. engagement -- renewed engagement be seen in any way as a counterbalance to a rising China?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out of town, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just seeing the press reports.\xc2\xa0 I have not had a full briefing on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s intentions and what they\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated to our administration.\xc2\xa0 But this kind of activity is never helpful when it comes to peace negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned that we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing each side made the extra effort involved to get a breakthrough that could finally create a framework for a secure Israel living side and side -- side by side in peace with a sovereign Palestine.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep on working on it, though, because it is in the world\xe2\x80\x99s interest, it is in the interest of the people of Israel, and it is in the interest of the Palestinian people to achieve that settlement, to achieve that agreement.\xc2\xa0 But each of these incremental steps can end up breaking down trust between the parties.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEven though it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t directed to me, I do want to just chime in briefly on the issue of China.\xc2\xa0 We want China to succeed and prosper.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good for the United States if China continues on the path of development that it\xe2\x80\x99s on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat means that, first of all, just from a humanitarian point of view, lifting millions of people out of poverty is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 It is also a huge expanding market where America then can sell goods and services and so we think China being prosperous and secure is a positive.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in containing that process.\xc2\xa0 We want China to continue to achieve its development goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe do want to make sure that everybody is operating within an international framework and sets of rules in which countries recognize their responsibilities to each other.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true for the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true for China.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true for Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s true for all of us.\xc2\xa0 And the more that we have international mechanisms in which people say we have rights, we also have responsibilities, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to abide by them, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold each other accountable, the better off we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT YUDHOYONO:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the views that I have of the future of our region, the region of Asia, including East Asia and Southeast Asia, all wish to have a region that is experiencing development, including economic development.\xc2\xa0 This region should continue to be a region that is stable, a region that is peaceful and a region that is safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn this regard, the community that is built upon an Asia, an East Asia also, and also a framework now through the East Asia Summit framework, we have the responsibility to -- in one area, to ensure that the cooperation in the region, especially in the area of economic cooperation, can contribute significantly to the development of the global economy that will bring benefit for all humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn the other spot of the coin, we also have the responsibility to ensure stability and security in our region.\xc2\xa0 I am not using any theory or the theory of one power to counterbalance the other powers.\xc2\xa0 But I do have the view that there must be some form of dynamic equilibrium in Asia Pacific, in East and Southeast Asia. And the formation of such regional cooperation such that is East Asia Summit, where there are 10 countries from ASEAN and there is also China, Republic of Korea, Japan, India, Australia, New Zealand, and now Russia and the United States, therefore, I have faith that it will be more effective to ensure peace, stability and order in this region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd in this regard, with such a condition, such cooperation in the area of economic will go effectively and it is Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s hope that China and the U.S. relations will continue to flow well because if something happens between those two states, it will have severe impacts to not only countries in the region, in Asia, but also to the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFor that reason, I hope that the economic relations between the U.S. and China will continue to proceed well, despite the geopolitical developments.\xc2\xa0 We also hope to contribute to creating a region in East Asia, in Southeast Asia, and especially in Asia Pacific, to become a region that is stable and productive. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat is my views in general on the regional architecture issues and the future cooperation in our region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the joint press conference.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t7:16 P.M.
