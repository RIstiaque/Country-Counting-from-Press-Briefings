PST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to sunny Palm Springs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to go ahead and get started.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Deputy National Security Advisor for Communications, Ben Rhodes, has been waylaid in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s still scheduled to attend the summit.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be here later today, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be able to make this briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ll do is, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn it over to National Security Advisor, Ambassador Rice.\xc2\xa0 She has some opening remarks.\xc2\xa0 And then I think we have the pool dialed in, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it to them for some questions, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up to the rest of the room.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be with you all in beautiful Rancho Mirage, California. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re very excited to be hosting the leaders of 10 countries of ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 This summit is truly an historic occasion.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve hosted ASEAN leaders here in the United States for this kind of meeting.\xc2\xa0 That we\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in doing so reflects a return on seven years of significant and sustained investment by this administration and by President Obama, personally, in the Asia Pacific and in Southeast Asia in particular.\xc2\xa0 And it demonstrates our enduring commitment to this vital region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Indeed, as reflected by this summit, U.S.-ASEAN relations have never been stronger.\xc2\xa0 With nearly half the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s population, one-third of global GDP, some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most capable militaries and some of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s most critical ecosystems, the Asia Pacific region is increasingly the world\xe2\x80\x99s political and economic center of gravity.\xc2\xa0 Which is why President Obama, from the very beginning, has prioritized engagement with Asia, recognizing that this region is central to U.S. interests in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was the impetus behind our Rebalance strategy, which aims to forge a network of partners throughout Asia who work together to build and sustain a rules-based regional order.\xc2\xa0 And, ASEAN, of course, is at the heart of Asia.\xc2\xa0 This 10-state union -- founded on common principles, like respect for international law, free trade, and peaceful resolution of disputes -- is a natural partner for the United States, and from day one has been a core focus of the rebalance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our ties with Asia have expanded dramatically over the last seven years.\xc2\xa0 In 2009, we signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We joined the East Asia Summit.\xc2\xa0 We became the first ASEAN Dialogue partner to establish a dedicated, diplomatic mission, and appoint a resident ambassador to the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta.\xc2\xa0 And in 2013, we created the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, YSEALI, which now has over 60,000 vibrant members.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our economic ties are also booming.\xc2\xa0 We have a quarter-trillion-dollar trade relationship with ASEAN, up 55 percent since 2009.\xc2\xa0 The ASEAN region is now the fourth-largest goods export market for the United States.\xc2\xa0 Trade with ASEAN countries supports more than 500,000 American jobs.\xc2\xa0 Last year alone, companies from right here in California exported $11 billion in goods to ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 In fact, companies from all 50 of our states engage in trade with ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 U.S. companies have been the largest investor in ASEAN, with a stock of more than $226 billion nearly doubling since 2008.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ASEAN is also an increasingly important partner in addressing regional and global challenges -- from maritime disputes to climate change, pandemic disease to violent extremism, sustainable development to trafficking in persons -- which is why last year, during the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Malaysia, we elevated our partnership with ASEAN to a strategic partnership.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is much more we can still do together, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xc2\xa0 Over the next day and a half, we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss our shared interest in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, encouraging peaceful resolution of disputes, and combatting terrorism, pandemic disease, climate change, and trafficking in persons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re quite aware that some of our ASEAN partners have a long way to go on human rights.\xc2\xa0 But the United States will continue, as we do everywhere, to stand up for the rights of all people -- and I emphasized this point last week in my meeting at the White House with civil society representatives from all 10 ASEAN countries.\xc2\xa0 The President, as always, will stress the importance of good governance, the rule of law, human rights, and a vibrant civil society, and capable, accountable institutions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe unique and informal setting that we have here at Sunnylands will allow leaders to engage in more in-depth and candid discussions than is possible at the usual, more formal summit meetings.\xc2\xa0 So this we look forward to as a rare opportunity for candor and to identify new areas of cooperation that will help ensure peace and prosperity in this critical Asia Pacific region for our children and grandchildren.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take a few questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is Jeff Mason.\xc2\xa0 With regard to the South China Sea, what is your expectation of all of the groups agreeing to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, we\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble hearing you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and what is your reaction to, of course, the region that China has been pressuring countries like Cambodia and Laos not to sign on to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, we\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble hearing you.\xc2\xa0 If you could repeat that and speak up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question was, what is your expectation, Susan, tomorrow about the likelihood of a strong statement from all of ASEAN and the United States with regards to the South China Sea?\xc2\xa0 And what is your reaction to reports from the region about China having put pressure on some members not to sign that?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I think the question was about Chinese pressure on some ASEAN partners and the potential statement about the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 We will be continuing to work with our ASEAN partners on a potential statement that we might issue together.\xc2\xa0 This statement will cover a wide range of topics.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t be focused primarily on the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously have issued such statements in the past with ASEAN, and in it we consistently underscore our shared commitment to a peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of commerce and navigation, the rule of law, and the necessity of disputes being resolved through peaceful, legal means.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also have expressed concerns about efforts to resolve disputes through other means, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m very confident that, among other topics that we will discuss during the next day and a half, this will be an important one -- by no means the only one.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that our shared commitment to upholding these norms will be reinforced.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on Syria.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been a pretty tough week for U.N.-backed rebel forces in Syria.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting hit by Russian bombs in Aleppo and now we\'re seeing that the Turks in Turkey are also sort of hitting a lot of Kurdish forces that we\'ve been allied with.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering what the U.S. is doing to back up the forces as they come under attack from different sides.\xc2\xa0 And specifically, what\xe2\x80\x99s your response to what Turkey has been doing to sort of attack a lot of the Kurdish forces?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, what is Plan B if the ceasefire doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Russia from continuing its bombing campaign?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we continue our strong support for moderate opposition elements in Syria and for the government in Iraq, and we do so in furtherance of our primary objective, which is to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we have made progress on the ground in recent weeks and months, and we look, obviously, to see that progress sustained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you\'re right that this has been a period of intensified bombing, particularly in the north of Syria.\xc2\xa0 We have condemned that in the strongest terms, and we think it runs counter, frankly, to the commitment made in Munich of Friday and to our shared interest in seeing the violence reduced, civilians allowed to receive humanitarian assistance, which is of critical importance, and more importantly, ultimately to the goal of achieving a negotiated peaceful resolution of this dispute, which is necessary both for the well-being of the people of Syria and for a political transition to come into effect which reflects the will of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also essential, in our judgment, ultimately for the long-term success of the counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we\'ll continue our efforts both to support those on the ground who are fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do our best in partnership with our many allies in the coalition, now about 65. Turkey remains an important partner in that effort, as do many others.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll stay focused on the fight against ISIL even as we work intensively on the political track and the prerequisite steps discussed and agreed in principle in Munich to achieve a cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is Andrew Beatty from AFP.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask a related question about -- and get your view on the threat by the Islamic State in Libya.\xc2\xa0 There have been some reports that Libya is become something of a magnet for fighters (inaudible) the Sahel, and I wanted to get your view on what you think (inaudible) for increased military intervention there.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I couldn\'t hear him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Do you want to try one more time, a little louder?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to answer a question I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear, though.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not smart.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try again.\xc2\xa0 The question was about Libya and your assessment of the threat posed by the Islamic State there. There\xe2\x80\x99s the suggestion that it is becoming something of a magnet for fighters from across the Sahel, and also -- well, I just wanted to get your view on, like I said, whether you should consider increased military intervention to deal with that threat.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry -- is that Andrew?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 You\'re really breaking up and it\'s very hard for me to hear the question.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re going to come to some folks in the room here.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up, Ambassador.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned northern Syria.\xc2\xa0 There have been several specific attacks at hospitals, schools, a UNICEF facility, an MSF facility there, as many as 50 people dead, many of them children, we\'re told, in an area where the Russians and Syrians have been very active.\xc2\xa0 What is your understanding of exactly what happened there and who is to blame, who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to offer you details on what\xe2\x80\x99s transpired on the ground.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been very clear, and the State Department issued a strong statement today condemning the bombings both of the MSF facility and other facilities in which civilians, we believe, were present.\xc2\xa0 It appears that this was action taken by the regime with the backing of its supporters, but I can\'t provide a specific attribution at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it concern you that this happened right after President Obama had a direct conversation with President Putin, saying that this sort of activity -- military activity had to stop?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 What concerns us, Ron, obviously is that as the violence continues, more and more civilians are being impacted.\xc2\xa0 And the pressure on civilians and the outflow of displaced persons from their areas of residence is increasing.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we have put a premium on trying the halt the violence, enable humanitarian access, and create an environment that is conducive for a political track to get underway.\xc2\xa0 That is the reason for our collective efforts in Munich.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'ll be working in the coming days to try to encourage all parties to implement the agreements reached at Munich.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s why the President will continue his communications with leaders of all stripes who have a role to play in this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with some of these countries at the summit to try to limit their cooperation with North Korea, militarily, economically.\xc2\xa0 Can you be a little more specific on what you might expect to come out of this on that front?\xc2\xa0 And would you say you\'re putting pressure on them to do so?\xc2\xa0 Also, what effect do you expect that to have on North Korea?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, North Korea is obviously a topic of interest to the entire region, certainly to the United States and our allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea.\xc2\xa0 So we will continue our work to contain and reduce the threat posed by North Korea.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do it both in the context of our discussions here on the margins -- this is not a topic formally on the agenda -- but more urgently, as we have done bilaterally and trilaterally in our cooperation with the Korean government in Seoul and Japanese government as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn New York, we continue to work and see the negotiations on a Security Council resolution, which we expect will contain significant new sanctions, progress.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ll be working on this issue, as we have been on multiple fronts simultaneously in the coming days.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I actually heard Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s question and it\'s kind of an important one, so if it\'s okay I\'ll just repeat it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 You are asking it yourself?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll ask it myself.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to hear your answer.\xc2\xa0 What he was asking was there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern that Libya has become a magnet for foreign fighters from all across the Sahel, and so his question was, how concerned are you by those reports?\xc2\xa0 And also, is that concern prompting you to weigh more seriously some form of military intervention in Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I heard you much better.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Libya is an important area of interest and concern for us for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, we\'re actively engaged in trying to support the effort to establish a unity government and our diplomatic efforts have been quite energetic in trying to back the U.N. effort there.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen some modest progress, but obviously that is a difficult and persistent challenge.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s a necessary aspect of trying to help to stabilize Libya, because when it\'s had competing governments, it\'s been even more fertile ground for extremists to exploit even when it had a weak central government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the terrorist threat there, this is something we have long been focused on.\xc2\xa0 We have been involved in trying to improve our situational awareness both of the threat as it\'s evolved and to take steps to counter that threat, which is why the United States has acted against the ISIL leader in Libya with success.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re going to stay very focused on the ISIL threat as it relates to Libya.\xc2\xa0 Just as we have done in Iraq and Syria, we will be trying to cut the flow of foreign fighters and financing, look at opportunities to build partnerships with those on the ground, and take action as appropriate and necessary against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m not prepared to suggest anything further than that at this point.\xc2\xa0 But this is an area, as we look at combating ISIL globally, where the United States is giving considerable attention, along with our partners and allies in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ambassador, thank you.\xc2\xa0 When President Obama spoke with Vladimir Putin, did he receive any kind of assurances Russia will stop its ongoing bombing in Syria?\xc2\xa0 It would seem that Russia says one thing diplomatically and then continues to charge ahead with its battlefield dynamics.\xc2\xa0 It does not appear that the U.S. has much leverage here.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reason to think that it will change now?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have to see, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not prepared to characterize Russian motives.\xc2\xa0 I am prepared to characterize some of their recent actions as being counterproductive and actions that we\'ve condemned.\xc2\xa0 Clearly the intensified bombing, the displacement, the fact that civilian entities have been hit by the regime and its backers is of grave concern.\xc2\xa0 And it does call into question Russia\xe2\x80\x99s willingness or ability to implement the agreements achieved in Munich.\xc2\xa0 That said, we still believe that Russia has the ability, should it choose to play a constructive role, in restraining the regime, obviously its own actions as well, and we stand ready, in cooperation with our partners in the Syria Support Group, to do our part to try to bring about the cessation and the humanitarian access that\'s so badly needed.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see what Russia will do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the Russians can stop the regime but they\xe2\x80\x99re choosing not to?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I think they can.\xc2\xa0 And in the event that the two sides -- meaning the opposition and the Syrian government -- indeed commit to implement the cessation, they will be obliged to.\xc2\xa0 But we will see how events unfold over the coming days.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to follow up on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned your efforts at the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 It seems that the Chinese still be reticent to have tougher sanctions against North Korea.\xc2\xa0 How can you get support around member states at the Security Council?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, China is obviously a critical player at the United Nations and it, too, has choices to make.\xc2\xa0 We have had ongoing discussions with the Chinese in New York.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has spoken to President Xi.\xc2\xa0 I think these discussions are progressing.\xc2\xa0 But I think it unlikely that China wants to be seen by the international community as the protector of North Korea, given its recent outrageous behavior in violation of international law and U.N. Security Council resolution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, given that, I expect that they will indeed come onboard with significant new sanctions, and we\'re working towards that end.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 North Korea announced this retaliation against the Japanese government, that they announced that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to (inaudible) and dismantle abduction meeting, which is supposed to investigate North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s abduction of Japanese people.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been supportive of Japan in its efforts to pursue resolution of the abductions, and we hope that Japan\xe2\x80\x99s interest in this will continue to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Ambassador, may I ask a question on human rights?\xc2\xa0 The President is hosting people like Thammavong of Laos, Hun Sen of Cambodia, Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei, all people that have terrible human rights records.\xc2\xa0 And human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, says that this sends a signal that the United States supports and legitimizes these leaders to their people, and that, in fact, the pivot to Asia is about a pivot to governments, rather than to people and civil society.\xc2\xa0 How would you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 I dispute that strenuously.\xc2\xa0 We deal with countries around the world, including in Asia, with whom we have serous disagreements on human rights, on democracy, on corruption, and yet we do talk to them.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we take every opportunity, both publicly and privately, to underscore our grave concerns about human rights.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I made mention of that in my opening statement.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I spent an hour and a half last week with leaders of ASEAN civil society to hear their points of view, to ensure that their perspectives and concerns were incorporated into our thinking and planning for this summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have stood with the people of Southeast Asia for many years as they seek to build more just, more open, more accountable societies.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been significant supporters of civil society organizations.\xc2\xa0 YSEALI, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, is about the United States building people-to-people ties with the next generation of the region\xe2\x80\x99s leaders.\xc2\xa0 So just because, in Asia, as elsewhere, we are obliged to deal with governments, including in some cases those with whom we have significant disagreements on things like human rights, does not mean that we\'re legitimizing them or their behavior, or that we have in any way lessened our commitment to democracy, human rights and civil society.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I am willing to entertain any topics of the domestic nature that you might have.\xc2\xa0 Should we try the pool again?\xc2\xa0 Is the pool still with us?\xc2\xa0 Jeff, do you want to give it a whirl?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any domestic questions.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Eric.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Okay. Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering, Eric, whether you can give us any updates at all on a timetable for a selection of a nominee for the Court, or any details on who might be leading the effort to vet candidates.\xc2\xa0 Anything new on that front?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on the timetable.\xc2\xa0 As we said yesterday, the President will take the time and rigor this process deserves before selecting a nominee.\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate an announcement this week, especially given that the Senate is out on recess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as soon as the Senate returns, the President was very clear that he is going to fulfill his constitutional responsibility to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia and he also called on the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m going to resist the urge to engage in speculation about lists and names.\xc2\xa0 But if you are looking to get a sense of the types of jurists the President nominates, I\'d urge you to take a look the two Supreme Court justices that the President has already nominated and successfully got confirmed to the bench.\xc2\xa0 And I\'d also urge you to look at the several hundred judges the President has nominated and successfully confirmed to the lower courts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGenerally speaking, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees adhere to a number of basic principles, which I\'m happy to share with you.\xc2\xa0 Number one, I\'d say the President\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees are all eminently qualified with a record of excellence and integrity.\xc2\xa0 The President looks for individuals who have impeccable credentials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber two, the President intends to nominate individuals who honor constitutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who have a commitment to impartial justice, respect the integrity of the judicial process, and adhere to precedent.\xc2\xa0 The President seeks judges who will faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd lastly, the President is also mindful that there are rare cases where the law is not clear, and we acknowledge that those incidents occur most often at the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And in those times, a judge will have to bring his or her own ethics and moral bearings into a decision.\xc2\xa0 In those instances, the President seeks judges that understand that justice is not about some abstract legal theory or a footnote in a casebook, but it is also about how our laws affect the daily realities of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook no further than the past year or two at the rulings coming out of highest court of the land, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that these aren\'t cases that are just about legal theory but they\xe2\x80\x99re about the way that people go about their daily lives.\xc2\xa0 And often that means protecting people\xe2\x80\x99s freedoms.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given all that\'s now being said -- I mean, starting hours after Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s death -- by Republicans, including the Senate Majority Leader, what is your take on this?\xc2\xa0 And do you feel that there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance that a nominee that you put forward is going to go anywhere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Of course.\xc2\xa0 The President was clear that he plans on fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities, and we expect the United States Senate to do the same.\xc2\xa0 Those responsibilities described in the Constitution are ironclad.\xc2\xa0 There are no caveats. \xc2\xa0The Constitution does not include exemptions for election years or for the President\xe2\x80\x99s last term in office.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no exemptions for when a vacancy can tip the balance of the Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I acknowledge your skepticism here because we do know that this is a Republican Congress that has a lot of practice saying no.\xc2\xa0 This is the Republican Party leadership that shut down the government in 2013, that brought us to the brink of defunding the Department of Homeland Security just last year, and just a few weeks ago announced they won\'t even have a hearing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 But I also want to point out that this is not the first time that Republicans have come out with a lot of bluster only to have reality ultimately sink in.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered us closely, Republicans threatened to keep sequester-level funding for the government.\xc2\xa0 They threatened to not raise the debt limit.\xc2\xa0 They threatened to not reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\xc2\xa0 And they threatened to upend the deal with Iran. \xc2\xa0At each pass, they took a hard line, they tried to play politics, but ultimately they were not able to back up their threats.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we believe that in those instances, Republicans fell back when their positions aren\'t tenable.\xc2\xa0 And we are only asking members of the United States Senate to do their job.\xc2\xa0 Some of you were fortunate enough to be with us in Springfield, where the President talked about the yearning in this country for elected officials to be able to put aside partisan politics in order to fulfill core responsibilities of their job.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all we\'re asking for today.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on that, you talked about things that they backed off of.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that there could be consequences for the Republicans if they continue this line?\xc2\xa0 And what do you think those consequences might be?\xc2\xa0 And where is the real leverage that you think the President has in trying to make this happen?\xc2\xa0 Again, as opposed to that list of things that they backed off, what do you think is the real leverage that he has and what do you think are the consequences for the Republicans if they persist in this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, good questions, Ron.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely consequences for the Court.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of cases pending before the Court this term.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not going to speculate on how this particular tragedy will affect the rulings of the Court. I will say that, as you all understand, the effect of a 4-4 split is to affirm the decision of the lower court without setting a precedent going forward.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of those cases that are pending before the Court right now, some of them the administration had won and in other instances the administration is appealing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut your point is a good one, which is we need a fully staffed Supreme Court; that there are indeed a number of important cases on the docket this year, touching a range of important areas of law, many of which affect people\xe2\x80\x99s daily lives.\xc2\xa0 This only underscores why it\'s important for the Court to have a full complement of nine judges -- justices.\xc2\xa0 And this isn\'t a new argument.\xc2\xa0 In fact, in 1988, when President Ronald Reagan was advocating for his own nominee against a Democratic Senate, he said that \xe2\x80\x9cEvery day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people\xe2\x80\x99s business in that crucially important body.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We couldn\'t agree more.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate the President trying to make an appeal directly to voters in certain swing states where there are -- certain important states where there are elections coming up?\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get the point of, first, how engaged is the President going to be, beyond the statements that he\xe2\x80\x99s already made.\xc2\xa0 And what do you really think is the consequence that the Republicans will face if they persist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is already deeply engaged.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been in touch with his senior team, both those at the White House this weekend and those of us traveling with him on this.\xc2\xa0 White House officials have been engaged with congressional offices, primarily on the Senate side, but both Democrat and Republican offices.\xc2\xa0 Those conversations have been preliminary in nature but are a signal that we plan on conducting robust engagement throughout this entire process.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m going to resist the urge to talk about the politics of this.\xc2\xa0 In fact, again, if you go back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Springfield, he talked about moments that are too important to play politics with.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court, the highest court of the land, seems to be one of those moments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has talked a lot about regretting how divisive Washington has become.\xc2\xa0 So does he see this choice as an opportunity to perhaps reach out to the other side?\xc2\xa0 Or is the White House just preparing for a fight to get their nominee through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a clever way of asking me to handicap potential nominees, which I resist the urge to do.\xc2\xa0 Again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the type of jurist that the President would likely select, I\xe2\x80\x99d really encourage you to go back to the several hundred nominees the President has put forward for the federal courts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou are right that the President has called for a better functioning politics and more a constructive politics.\xc2\xa0 For the President, that means a federal government that is more responsive to its citizenry.\xc2\xa0 And we hear often that Republicans have said that elections matter and that the people should have a say in who is on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President was reelected on November 6, 2012.\xc2\xa0 And at that time, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will find Republicans saying that this could have an impact on the Court.\xc2\xa0 And again, that was November 6, 2012.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have 11 months to go in the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term; that\xe2\x80\x99s just under a quarter of our term.\xc2\xa0 And if you go back through history and you look at the average time spans for how long a Supreme Court justice takes between getting nominated and confirmed, it\xe2\x80\x99s about 65, 70 days.\xc2\xa0 We are well within that to get this done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t see this as particularly politically charged because of the timing, and that impacting the President\xe2\x80\x99s own decision-making?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re in an election year, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pretend that that\xe2\x80\x99s not part of the atmospherics here.\xc2\xa0 But the President is very focused on doing his job.\xc2\xa0 Again, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that you have to take my word for; this is laid out in the United States Constitution.\xc2\xa0 This is respecting the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 And we expect Republicans to do just that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI recall a piece from Leader McConnell that was published in the wake of his hard-fought victory regaining control of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 He said he wanted to get Congress functioning again, get it moving again.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for here, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any potential nominee could face obviously a very divisive confirmation fight and one that could be fruitless in the end, if we are to believe the leader of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned whether the best candidates might not want to go through that and would reject outright any kind of offer to do it?\xc2\xa0 And has the White House heard or talked to anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s expressed any concern like that at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any discussions along those lines.\xc2\xa0 And again, I would point to the very clear precedent for confirming a nominee in an election year, even when the Senate is not controlled by that President\xe2\x80\x99s party.\xc2\xa0 As I think some of you have researched, six Supreme Court justices have been confirmed in presidential election years, including three Republican appointees.\xc2\xa0 Another 11 have been confirmed in non-presidential election years.\xc2\xa0 And the most recent, as I think some of us have remarked, was nominated by the Republicans and confirmed by Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Justice Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, was confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Congress in February 1988, just 65 days after his nomination.\xc2\xa0 At that point, every single Republican voted to confirm Justice Kennedy, despite it being an election year.\xc2\xa0 The only difference I can tell right now is that Barack Obama is a Democrat.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to read something to you.\xc2\xa0 You may find this a little interesting:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cFor the rest of this President\xe2\x80\x99s term, [and] if there\xe2\x80\x99s another Republican elected with the same selection criteria, let me say this:\xc2\xa0 We should reverse the presumption of confirmation\xe2\x80\xa6With respect to the Supreme Court, at least -- I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Those are the words of Chuck Schumer in 2007, with 18 months remaining in the term of President Bush.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you hear comments -- when you read comments like that, and you compare them to today, is it not hypocritical that some are sort of trying to play this in saying, listen, we should get this done in a very speedy fashion, when, in fact, many of the so-called leaders on the other side did virtually the same thing, or participated in the same sort of rhetoric, if you will, back then?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of quotes moving back and forth.\xc2\xa0 For the President, this boils down to something very simple:\xc2\xa0 just doing his job.\xc2\xa0 And we expect the Senate to do the same.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is almost a full year -- 340 days -- before the next President takes office.\xc2\xa0 Since the 1980s, every person appointed to this Supreme Court has been given a prompt hearing and a vote within 100 days.\xc2\xa0 Most recently, Justice Kagan went from nominee to appointment in 88 days.\xc2\xa0 Justice Sotomayor, 67 days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all we\xe2\x80\x99re asking is for the same standard to apply.\xc2\xa0 We also believe it would irresponsible and unprecedented to let a vacancy on the Court extend into 2017.\xc2\xa0 If Congress fails to act, the Supreme Court will preside for well over a year with a vacancy, and would not only impact two consecutive Supreme Court terms, it would be wholly unprecedented for the modern Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 In fact, since the 1980s, there\xe2\x80\x99s never been any vacancy spanning more than one term.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why not do a recess appointment?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the President wanted to -- in light of the Senate being out of session this week, the President wanted to take a little bit of time and go through this process in a thoughtful and rigorous way.\xc2\xa0 So I expect that when the Senate returns within due time, the President will identify and announce a nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just last thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Of course.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, then, is it your expectation that the Senate, despite sort of the rhetoric, will, in fact, give an up-or-down vote on a nominee?\xc2\xa0 And the reason I ask that is, if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying we believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s the process that should go forward, and we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary then to fill the vacancy by recess appointment, then it is your expectation, I imagine, that they will, in fact, vote up or down.\xc2\xa0 Or am I over-reading it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No, our expectation is that members of the United States Senate will do their jobs, and that, yes, that includes Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That includes identifying an ample number of Republicans who take their oath of office seriously and who take their fidelity to the United States Constitution seriously enough to do their jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alex.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President see, though, that by filibustering a nominee they would not be doing their jobs?\xc2\xa0 Because in 2006, Senator Obama joined 24 colleagues in an effort to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Justice Samuel Alito.\xc2\xa0 Does he see that as not following their jobs?\xc2\xa0 Did he not follow his job when he was a senator?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past 24 hours is something entirely different, which is Republicans abjectly objecting to even the President putting forth a nominee.\xc2\xa0 So we believe -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anyone in here would disagree -- but we believe we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything like that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe it would be wholly irresponsible to leave the Supreme Court short-staffed, especially considering the important work pending before them.\xc2\xa0 And that the consequences of that, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 Again, President Reagan said that every day that the Court is short-staffed, it impairs the work of that important body.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks so much, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Let me go back to the South China Sea and the Sunnylands meeting.\xc2\xa0 I believe the United States and ASEAN countries are preparing Sunnylands principle, which include freedom of navigation and (inaudible), and also no militarization in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 So what particular message are you going to deliver in this meeting?\xc2\xa0 And also, has the United States asked ASEAN countries to play a role to sustain peace and security in the South China Sea?\xc2\xa0 What kind of role does the United States expect ASEAN to play?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I know that Ambassador Rice addressed this briefly earlier, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll also have more to say on this over the next 36 hours.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the President.\xc2\xa0 But our message on this is not particularly different today than it has been over the past few weeks and months, which is we fully support freedom of navigation and that we are going to stand by our partners in the region, and make sure that international norms are respected.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, one more.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more relevant to Asia perspective.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99m from Cambodia.\xc2\xa0 My question is, why Obama, he decided to host the summit in Sunnylands instead of the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 The President has used the venue here at Sunnylands as a relaxed venue where heads of state and other leaders, his counterparts from around the world, can have a more informal, casual discussion.\xc2\xa0 In Washington, there\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit more of a stiffness.\xc2\xa0 And the President wanted to be able to afford the world leaders here more of an opportunity to have a more candid, relaxed discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol, one more.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify -- when you said that the President has been in touch with senior advisors on the Supreme Court issue, is he going over a specific list?\xc2\xa0 Has he asked them to come up with a list of candidates?\xc2\xa0 Is he looking at that?\xc2\xa0 Where is he in this process?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re only a few days old here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to release the details of those conversations, but my only point was the President -- Ron asked has the President been engaged, and the answer to that is yes.\xc2\xa0 And for a starting point, that means working with his team, both White House officials who are back at the White House and back here, to make sure that this process is moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just two other things.\xc2\xa0 When you said that you guys have been reaching out to Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, you mean on the Judiciary Committee, or McConnell?\xc2\xa0 Who specifically are you reaching --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so you can imagine we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from a lot of folks on the incoming, and then we\xe2\x80\x99re also proactively reaching out to key offices.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list here to detail.\xc2\xa0 But I think in the coming days, that engagement and that outreach will become more extensive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, can you say -- have you guys said when the President will sign the sanctions legislation on North Korea?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on that for you, but I can try and check.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that to happen while he\xe2\x80\x99s here via autopen, or do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll do it when he returns to Washington?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure we have the bill yet.\xc2\xa0 But as soon as I have an update on that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1:20 P.M.
