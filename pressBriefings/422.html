EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, as you know, the President will be addressing the National Convention of the American Legion, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss keeping our commitment to America\xe2\x80\x99s veterans isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a policy priority, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a moral obligation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President, when he took office, dedicated additional resources to mental health care for veterans, benefits for those veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, and loans for those veterans and members of their families who are trying to get an education.</p>\n<p>And in light of reports earlier this summer that highlighted the need for new management reforms to improve service delivery at the VA for our veterans, the administration acted quickly to implement them.\xc2\xa0 But there is a lot more work to be done, some of which has already been announced just today.\xc2\xa0 And as Secretary McDonald continues his work, he\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that accountability is restored at the VA and that America has a VA that puts our veterans first.</p>\n<p>So you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot more from the President on this issue today, and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the factsheet that we put out earlier today for additional details on some of these proposals.</p>\n<p>So with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you talk to us a little bit about surveillance over Syria, what the goals are?\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s some imminent military action by the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 And has the U.S. consulted at all with the Assad regime over this surveillance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me start with a couple of things that I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the President has not made any decisions at this point about any military operations in Syria.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to discuss the details -- the operational details of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence activities.\xc2\xa0 As I also mentioned yesterday, there are teams of professionals at the Pentagon who are responsible on a daily basis for reviewing and updating and putting together contingency plans for the President of the United States and the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is work that the Pentagon does on a regular basis, and for details about those plans I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t a surprise to anybody here that those plans are based on intelligence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we have also made clear that is the President, as a matter of policy, will not hesitate to use military force where necessary to protect Americans.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been just as clear about our view that resolving the situation in Iraq, related to ISIL, is not something that can be done only using America\xe2\x80\x99s military might.\xc2\xa0 Permanently restoring -- or at least restoring on a sustainable basis security to the nation of Iraq and to that region between Iraq and Syria will require the United States to use so many other tools in our arsenal.\xc2\xa0 It will require an effective, inclusive Iraqi government that can unite that country to face the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It will require the involvement of other governments in the region that have a blatantly obvious interest in this outcome.\xc2\xa0 It will require the involvement of countries around the world, particularly our Western allies that also have an incentive to confront that threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>We talked also a little bit yesterday about the risk that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by foreign fighters, those individuals with Western passports that have traveled to that region and taken up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned, and our allies are concerned, about the risk that is posed by those individuals returning to the West and carrying out violent actions in the West that could be aimed at Western targets.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about what our strategy is here, and it is a strategy that is focused on using all the elements of American power and influence to try to resolve this situation.\xc2\xa0 That, of course, includes the military, but is not limited only to the military.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Assad regime has said that any act over its territory would be considered a hostile act if they did not -- if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t notified.\xc2\xa0 Can you categorically say the U.S. will not notify or consult or coordinate with the Assad regime on any action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As a matter of U.S. policy, we have not recognized the Assad regime as the leader of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And there are no plans to change that policy, and there are no plans to coordinate with the Assad regime as we consider this terror threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the Egypt-UAE bombings in Libya?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on those reports either.\xc2\xa0 I would suggest that you check with the Egyptians and the Emiratis on those reports that cite their military involvement in Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The thing that I will reiterate is that it is the view of the United States that an outside interference in the situation in Libya only exacerbates the tensions in that country and serves to undermine the democratic transition that the political leaders in that country are trying to implement.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the specific reports of those military airstrikes, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the countries that are mentioned in those reports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it fair to say that you would not welcome the participation of other nations in that conflict at this point?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about specific military actions that are reported or maybe being contemplated by other countries.\xc2\xa0 But just as a general matter, it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that outside interference is counterproductive, because it exacerbates tensions that already exist in that country and undermines the democratic institutions -- admittedly fledgling democratic institutions, but democratic institutions nonetheless in that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to say exclusively, but can you give us some idea of where the President is in thinking and the decision on airstrikes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roger, as you know, the President has already ordered airstrikes that are underway in Iraq, that are aimed at a couple of specific goals; one is the protection of Americans in Iraq, and they were also deployed to avert a humanitarian disaster and a genocide there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about Syria.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As it relates to Syria, the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made any decisions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to give you an update in terms of where the President\xe2\x80\x99s current thinking is on this, other than to point out that our strategy on this, for dealing with this situation, does not rely solely on the American military.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember here is, at the risk of putting too fine a point on it, the previous administration tried relying only on our military.\xc2\xa0 And sending 140,000 American servicemen and women to Iraq for a prolonged period of time had an impact on the security situation in Iraq -- there is no question about that -- for the positive.</p>\n<p>But it was not -- it certainly was not the policy of the Bush administration or of the Obama administration to leave those American troops -- and there were hundreds of thousands of them, or more than a hundred thousand of them -- there permanently.\xc2\xa0 And what we saw is that the Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders didn\xe2\x80\x99t seize the opportunity to capitalize on that stabilized security situation.\xc2\xa0 And because of the failure of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership, we saw that that country was very vulnerable to the influence and to the attacks of violent extremists.</p>\n<p>And let me just go back to this, because this is important.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for us to build up effective partners in the region -- because for all of our efforts, they\xe2\x80\x99re only undermined if there aren\xe2\x80\x99t effective partners in the region and in these countries that can take responsibility for providing security for their own people.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the President is so cognizant of this idea that we can\xe2\x80\x99t rely only on American military might.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the American military has tremendous capabilities that can influence these kinds of situations.\xc2\xa0 But for a sustainable solution we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need effective partners both in the form of effective governments where these actions are taking place, but also the constructive contribution of other regional governments that have a clear interest and a vested stake in the outcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say the strategy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely solely on the military, that\xe2\x80\x99s a reference to the need for partners, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a reference to the way in which we\xe2\x80\x99re going to confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL, and the need for us to build up an effective partner in the Iraq government, but also the effective contribution -- or the constructive contribution of other governments in the region.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I clarify on -- the current military campaign in Iraq is based, in your all\xe2\x80\x99s view, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s inherent Commander-in-Chief powers, not on any previous authorization to use military force, either in 2001 or 2002?\xc2\xa0 Is that right?\xc2\xa0 In other words, not the Iraq resolution and not the post-9/11 resolution?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The current military action that has been ordered in Iraq is vested in the powers as the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 And we have filed war powers notifications demonstrating our commitment to coordinating with Congress as we deploy that power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It has been our policy that -- and the President talked about this in a speech he gave earlier this year about his view that the current Iraq AUMF, authorization to use military force, needed to be changed because it was so broad.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to the military actions that are underway, those are actions that are underway -- or that have been authorized under the President\xe2\x80\x99s powers as Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For a more detailed analysis, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go too much farther here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re sort of -- we\xe2\x80\x99re reaching the limits of my knowledge on this, because it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated and I want to make sure we get this right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s theory, then, that inherent power would be enough to go across the border into Syria as well?\xc2\xa0 If you expand what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing against the same enemy, is it the same authorization -- authority that you guys are relying on?\xc2\xa0 Or would you be using the 2001 one, which is what you do use in Somalia and Yemen and other places like that that use drone strikes, that kind of thing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said about this, Peter, is we have not speculated about what sort of authority would be required from Congress if the President were to make a decision to authorize military -- the use of military force in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Since he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made that decision, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about what sort of authority he may or may not use if he were to make that decision.\xc2\xa0 We just haven\xe2\x80\x99t sort of speculated that far.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate question, and if we reach the point where the President does make a decision to use military force in Syria, then that will open up an additional set of questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising right now.\xc2\xa0 But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t attempted to answer them at this point because the President has not made a decision to authorize military force in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you all make a distinction between this potential action and last year, when you asked Congress to weigh in -- not that you said Congress had to weigh in; you thought you had the authority even without Congress last year, but you said you wanted them to weigh in, to have a sense of consensus, right?\xc2\xa0 But you make a distinction between the retaliatory strikes you contemplated last year and these kind of intervention, which would be a different type.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the goals of those two missions -- the goal of the mission from last year was aimed squarely at the Assad regime and was in response to the intel assessment that they had used chemical weapons against innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>The situation a year later is markedly different.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now is confronting a terrorist group that has sought a safe haven in Syria.\xc2\xa0 This is a group that poses a threat to Americans in the region and could potentially, down the line, pose a broader threat to American interests and our allies around the globe.\xc2\xa0 So the situations are somewhat different.</p>\n<p>Now, what the ramifications of those differences are for our -- for some of the legalistic questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking are important.\xc2\xa0 But these are questions that I don\'t have answers for right now just because the President, like I said, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision to authorize this military action in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question on this.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of the timetable?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Secretary Kerry today.\xc2\xa0 How important is that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President confers on a regular basis with the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 They typically will meet on a weekly basis when the Secretary of State is in Washington, which is rare these days.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s putting a lot of miles on the airplane.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that they will discuss a range of issues in that meeting, including our ongoing efforts to face down the threat that\'s posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>But in terms of whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s a presidential decision that will come directly out of this meeting, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I just meant, like are we -- are we talking about days?\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about weeks?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he didn\'t move that quickly on Iraq, right?\xc2\xa0 He came out in June and said, I\xe2\x80\x99m contemplating airstrikes, but he didn\'t move until August when he felt the circumstances had changed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President is watching the situation very closely, as are the other elements of his national security team.\xc2\xa0 Some of that is because there is already kinetic military action that\'s underway in Iraq at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that has his close attention.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prejudge at this point when the President would act, or even at this point if he will act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- options yesterday in the meeting with Secretary Hagel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision, but was he presented with options in the meeting with Secretary Hagel yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position to get into the details of those discussions.</p>\n<p>Did you have a question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was just -- anything imminent on it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have an update on the timing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there are reports today that Ukraine took Russian soldiers the day after the ambassador -- the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine sent out a tweet that was very solidly against Russia\xe2\x80\x99s incursion into Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, on the fact that Ukraine has soldiers and what the President thinks should be done at this point.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our posture on this remains that we are disappointed that President Putin and the Russians have not used their influence to deescalate this situation.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, what we have seen are repeated provocations by the Russian regime to further escalate tensions in the region.\xc2\xa0 And whether that\'s moving humanitarian convoys across the border into eastern Ukraine without the consent of the Ukrainian government, that certainly represents a pretty flagrant escalation of this situation.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of reports that the Russians are now actively moving military hardware across the border.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for some time, and there are some indications that the pace of those movements have increased.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually asked President Putin to do the opposite.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually asked him to use his influence to try to deescalate the situation and to convince pro-Russian separatists to actually lay down arms and to negotiate with the legitimate government of Ukraine to resolve this situation.</p>\n<p>So the Russian regime has faced sanctions from the international community, and their economy has borne some costs as a result of their actions in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And by continuing to ramp up that activity, they make the imposition of additional costs even more likely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President pessimistic about the meeting today between Poroshenko and Putin?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him about that specific meeting, but we certainly will be interested to learn about those discussions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that U.S. officials will be in touch with the Ukrainians to hear their takeaways from that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, was the White House aware that Vice President Biden was doing these photo-line fundraisers with congressional candidates tacked onto official trips or other campaign trips and not announcing them publicly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will say that I know that -- well, let me say that I read your story in Politico today, so I\xe2\x80\x99m now aware of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We got a reader.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s at least one, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s political activities are obviously very closely coordinated with the political activities of the President and other senior members of the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 So the President and Vice President are spending a lot of time and energy supporting Democrats who are on the ballot this fall, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I would observe is I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is a significant difference between the Vice President, for example, doing photo lines, where he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do formal remarks, in support of Democratic fundraising activities, and the President convening roundtables with donors to Democratic Party causes to discuss his support for Democrats in the fall elections.</p>\n<p>There isn\xe2\x80\x99t press access for either of those things, because in neither case is the President or the Vice President delivering formal remarks.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that they are indicative of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s desire to support the campaigns of Democratic candidates who are eager to support the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda and support the plight of middle-class families in the Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President doing any events like that where he\xe2\x80\x99s doing photo lines attached to events for Democratic donors that aren\xe2\x80\x99t on the public schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know the President typically does photo lines in conjunction with fundraising events.\xc2\xa0 Off the top of my head, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of an example in which the President has done a photo line without doing a more formal fundraising event.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not a definitive thing, because it\xe2\x80\x99s off the top of my head, but if he\xe2\x80\x99s done any of those he\xe2\x80\x99s not done very many.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is Senator Hagan -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see -- is the Senator on the plane?\xc2\xa0 Is she meeting the President on the tarmac?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the deal today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She is not on the plane.\xc2\xa0 I understand that she\xe2\x80\x99s been in North Carolina for the August recess.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that both Senator Burr and Senator Hagan will meet the President on arrival at the airport in Charlotte.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he travel in with them to the convention?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their travel plans are.\xc2\xa0 You should check with them.\xc2\xa0 I believe that both senators, however, are addressing the convention at some point while the convention is in town.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hagan had some pretty harsh comments on the President, in her statement last Friday -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw it.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Senator Hagan is certainly an independent voice for the people of North Carolina, and that means that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always agree with President Obama on a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 But Senator Hagan has demonstrated that she is a dedicated advocate for America\xe2\x80\x99s veterans.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is, too.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that means that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to work together, because they both believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re living up to our covenant with America\xe2\x80\x99s veterans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about potentially being a drag on Senator Hagan as she runs for reelection in November?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President, over the course of the last two elections, has performed -- has out-performed expectations in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 He obviously narrowly won North Carolina in 2008; fell just a little short in 2012.\xc2\xa0 But that demonstrates that the President has a pretty deep reservoir of political support here in North Carolina.</p>\n<p>The people of North Carolina -- the North Carolina economy in particular is one that benefits from the kinds of policies that the President is championing in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 Everything from investments in R&amp;D have a significant economic benefit in areas like the research triangle.\xc2\xa0 Immigration reform is something that would certainly benefit -- strongly benefit the North Carolina economy.\xc2\xa0 So there are any number of reasons why the President has strong support here in the state of North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 And if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President to lend some of that support to Senator Hagan\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, then he won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to do it.\xc2\xa0 But based, again, on my reading of Politico and other news organizations that are carefully covering the North Carolina Senate race, it sounds like Senator Hagan is doing a pretty darn good job of making a case for herself right now.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on the ground.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:06 A.M.
