EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard, everyone, on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 And we are en route to the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, where we\'ll celebrate the life and legacy of Senator Ted Kennedy and highlight the importance of the United States Senate in the lives of all Americans.</p>\n<p>I actually have a few scheduling announcements to lead us off here.\xc2\xa0 This Thursday, the President will travel to Louisville, Kentucky, for an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, the President will visit Hill Air Force Base in Utah for an event on the economy as well.\xc2\xa0 Further details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Kentucky and Utah will be available in the coming days.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow we\'ll switch to the coming year.\xc2\xa0 As you might have seen I think right before we took off, the government of Kenya has agreed to cohost the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, otherwise known as the GES, in July.\xc2\xa0 Organized annually since 2009, this event has emerged as a global platform connecting emerging entrepreneurs with leaders from business, international organizations and governments looking to support them.\xc2\xa0 This will be the first time the GES will take place in sub-Sahara Africa.</p>\n<p>President Obama will travel to Kenya in July, where he will hold bilateral meetings and participate in the Summit.\xc2\xa0 His trip will build on the success of the August 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, and continue our efforts to work with countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, to accelerate economic growth, strengthen democratic institutions, and improve security.</p>\n<p>This will be President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s fourth trip to sub-Saharan Africa during his presidency.</p>\n<p>With all of that news said, I\'m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the President will see family members or anybody else in Kenya?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule since we just announced the trip.\xc2\xa0 But as soon as we can flesh that out for you I will have that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know when it is?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 When in July?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When, yes.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s end of the month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Nation reported July 23rd.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Stand by.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you can say how many days the trip will be that would be great.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will try and nail down the exact dates.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s in the end of July, and I don\'t know if the exact parameters of the travel have been booked yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can you tell us whether the President had been briefed on the latest in the Iran talks and what he thinks about this issue that has been discussed over the weekend of whether Iran should have to send its fuel elsewhere as part of the deal?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Julie.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that our team has been engaged in constant around-the-clock meetings and negotiations over in Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 I can also tell you the President has been briefed regularly and frequently, and also has provided guidance as necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the story that you are referencing, I would say that, unfortunately, some of the details in that story were not correct.\xc2\xa0 The idea that there had been an agreement that Iran backed away from in the last 24 hours is not true.\xc2\xa0 In terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen with that stockpile that is something that our negotiators are working through, but it\'s not accurate to say there had been an agreement that was then backtracked.</p>\n<p>As we\'ve said all along now, nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t want to get ahead of what our negotiators are working on in the room, so beyond that we\'re not going to have much to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which of the two halves of that sentence aren\'t true?\xc2\xa0 Was there an agreement, or not?\xc2\xa0 And if there was, did they back away from it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think both of those are not true.\xc2\xa0 There was never an agreement on this issue yet.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s still something being worked out.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that to be part of the negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, tomorrow is the deadline.\xc2\xa0 Is the President prepared to walk away if there\xe2\x80\x99s not a deal by tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Isaac, the President has made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to take a bad deal, that the best way to eliminate Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to both shut off its path to a nuclear weapon and impose the most intrusive, stringent inspections ever.\xc2\xa0 And so the President is not prepared to take a bad deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is does he see tomorrow night as the deadline?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or is there any possibility of extending --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you we\'ve been negotiating for over a year now, and it\'s going to be up to the Iranians in order to make some tough decisions as the deadline nears in order to show the international community that it wants to get rid of its pathway to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to presuppose failure.\xc2\xa0 Those negotiations are going to go down to the wire.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve always said that when the extension was announced in November through June that we wanted a framework by the end of March, and that remains our position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there any flexibility at all about later this week?\xc2\xa0 And how should we imagine it for tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Is it an Eastern Time deadline?\xc2\xa0 Is it European time?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the specifics on that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, right now the negotiations are unfolding in Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of any announcements that come out of Switzerland, I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to speculate -- I\'m not going to presuppose failure on their part.\xc2\xa0 Our folks are working around the clock in earnest to try and get this done.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m going to leave the negotiating to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on the U.S. side, there\xe2\x80\x99s been reports that the President has been very engaged in trying to get congressional support and that there may be some leeway in allowing for congressional review of an agreement.\xc2\xa0 Can you bring us up to date on those?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Angela, as you know, we\'ve been working very hard to keep Congress briefed and up to date on this.\xc2\xa0 I believe if you count up our engagements with Congress on this issue they total in the hundreds.\xc2\xa0 And that includes one-on-one meetings, phone calls, briefing sessions, both classified and unclassified, with a range of officials, including the President, the Vice President of the United States, staff at the White House and Cabinet secretaries.\xc2\xa0 So we are proud of our record of robust consultation with Congress.</p>\n<p>We will still work through how we envision Congress\xe2\x80\x99s oversight role here.\xc2\xa0 We believe there is a role.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been some -- like the Corker-Menendez bill, we said we\xe2\x80\x99d veto that and we stand by that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any circumstances under which he would allow Congress to disapprove of any agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 David, what we said is that we are very open to working with Congress on this, that we want a robust consultative role.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve put our money where our mouth is, because I think, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s been several hundred different conversations, briefings, meetings, hearings, sessions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve participated in.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific mechanisms to announce to you today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, though.\xc2\xa0 When you say you envision a role for Congress, does that just mean a role for them to be briefed?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you guys see that Congress has a chance to have some input here but not through Corker-Menendez -- I mean, is there any legislative framework the President could envision giving to Congress to be able to have a say in this beyond just sitting in a briefing listening to what the details of the negotiations are?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Julie, the first half of this gaggle was about a deal that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come into place yet.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not going to go ahead and hypothetically engage that if and when that deal comes into play how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to consult with Congress.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you that if you look at our record hereto for of robustly consulting with Congress, I feel fairly confident that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be involved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Eric, can you provide any more details on how the President has been regularly briefed and provided guidance?\xc2\xa0 How often that\xe2\x80\x99s been?\xc2\xa0 Anything at all that would illuminate his role in this?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of internal details to read out to you at this time, but I can tell you that the President has been briefed regularly, frequently, and as I said, as the situation warrants, provided guidance to his team that is used by the negotiators in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite tell.\xc2\xa0 Are there any circumstances under which he would sign a bill that allows Congress to block an agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 David, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what legislative proposal you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s Corker-Menendez, we said we\xe2\x80\x99d veto it.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s another proposal out there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask, why would he veto it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Because, as you know, David, this is a purview that\xe2\x80\x99s been part of the executive branch for decades and the President retains the authority to conduct foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a partisan effort by Republicans in the Senate to undermine that ability, but the President believes that the best way to rid Iran of a nuclear weapon is to solve that diplomatically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does any bill that gives Congress a vote to veto a deal usurp executive authority?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 David, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about a legislative process -- a legislative proposal that I\'m not familiar with.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you the one that has been widely reported and is on the books, Corker-Menendez, is one that we\xe2\x80\x99d veto.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- agreement, who would sign it for the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good technical question that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you guys feel about Mitch McConnell and John Boehner being in Israel these couple of days as the deadline for Iran comes, talking with Netanyahu and talking about how they don\xe2\x80\x99t want this to go forward, the Iran deal?\xc2\xa0 Is that appropriate?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Isaac, I will admit I knew that trip was happening.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any comments they\xe2\x80\x99ve issued since they\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the ground in Israel.\xc2\xa0 I will say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that lawmakers from both parties visit the state of Israel all the time and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can you give us an update on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about the evolving crisis in Yemen?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Jeff, as you know, the Houthis\xe2\x80\x99 continued actions, despite the repeated condemnations of the international community, have caused widespread instability and chaos that threaten the safety and well-being of the Yemeni citizens.\xc2\xa0 And in support of the GGC actions to defend against Houthi violence, President Obama has authorized the provision of logistical and intelligence support to GCC-led military operations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Above all else, we strongly urge the Houthis the stop their destabilizing military actions and return to negotiations as part of the political dialogue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds like basically what you guys said last week.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about the latest role that Iran continues to play in this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, as we have said, we do have concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Yemen, which are contributing to destabilizing the situation and contributing to the threat posed to the legitimate government there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see any irony in the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re expressing this concern about Iran at the same time as these talks are going on?\xc2\xa0 And does it -- is it possible for us to assume that that is not being brought up in the Switzerland context?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I believe the State Department has said that on the sidelines of those talks, Secretary Kerry has brought this up -- has brought up Yemen with counterparts on the ground in Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 But largely, we view the negotiations with Iran about ending their pathway to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That is what the international community has been united on and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working towards.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On one domestic issue, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lee, as you\'re announcing this trip to Utah, has announce that he plans to investigate whether there was a White House roll to push the FTC to ends its investigation in 2013 into Google.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on whether there was a White House role and what you think about the possibility of Senator Lee looking into this?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Angela, I saw a quick news report on that before we took off, and I can tell you that the FTC is an independent organization which makes decisions independently.\xc2\xa0 So if you have questions about their process you should speak with the FTC.\xc2\xa0 I know that there was a news report about meetings with Google executives at the White House, and I would tell you that we meet with business leaders all the time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Utah, that is the second to last state that the President has not visited, correct, while in office?\xc2\xa0 And did that play a role in choosing his itinerary?\xc2\xa0 And how soon will he be headed to South Dakota?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Juliette, I opened with so many scheduling announcements -- (laughter) -- I have none additional at this time.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that we are going to have more information about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Utah in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support the human trafficking bill that\xe2\x80\x99s pending in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 David, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s been discouraging to this White House, that the United States Senate, only days after approaching a shutdown for the Department of Homeland Security, could not pass a human sex-trafficking bill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been a sign of Senate dysfunction and that is something we hope is resolved quickly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Democrats who are blocking it.\xc2\xa0 So is he troubled by that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re troubled that Congress, in this day and age -- especially as we head to the Edward Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate -- both struggles to fund the Department of Homeland Security and now cannot pass a bill discouraging human sex trafficking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the Democrats should stop blocking this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, we believe that this is an issue that should normally -- under normal circumstances, under Senate leadership that vowed when they took office this past January to get the Senate moving, that this should be one that\xe2\x80\x99s not controversial.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think Ted Kennedy would be upset by what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Senate today?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Isaac, I can tell you the President and First Lady both look forward to today\xe2\x80\x99s events.\xc2\xa0 I do think that it is worth noting that Senator Kennedy was a fierce fighter and a champion for those in our country who needed help the most.\xc2\xa0 And whether that was advancing civil rights, whether that was extending health care to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable populations, or securing the economic well-being of everyday Americans, Senator Ted Kennedy was driven by those not with connections and power, but by helping those precisely without the fame and fortune.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the same time, though, I think what the President admires most about Senator Kennedy was his ability to find common ground with Republicans, and work on issues across the aisle with Republicans in pursuit of a larger goal -- whether that was working with Senator Orrin Hatch on children\xe2\x80\x99s health insurance, Senator Grassley on their historic work to cover kids with disabilities, or with Senator Domenici to end injustice in treatment for the mentally ill.</p>\n<p>Nobody fought harder for his ideals than Senator Kennedy.\xc2\xa0 But he was a master at finding common ground and working with political adversaries if it meant fixing something that was broken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you said that what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with the trafficking bill is ironic given that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to the Kennedy Institute today.\xc2\xa0 So does the President think that Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s legacy is not being upheld by the modern Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Isaac, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to stay tuned for the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before we go, I wanted to ask you -- the reports in Australia that personal details of the world leaders was leaked from the Brisbane summit.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that the President\xe2\x80\x99s details weren\xe2\x80\x99t leaked?\xc2\xa0 And what more can you tell us?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm that at this time.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking into them and we\xe2\x80\x99ll take all appropriate steps necessary to ensure the privacy and security of the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of recourse does the United States government have if the President\xe2\x80\x99s passport details and other personal information has been sent to a football club?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re presupposing facts that I\xe2\x80\x99m unable to confirm at this time.\xc2\xa0 So, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look into this and make sure the President\xe2\x80\x99s privacy and security are maintained.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Small follow-up question.\xc2\xa0 Does the President actually use a passport when he travels?\xc2\xa0 Is that information given to a foreign government for visas and so forth, or not?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Julia, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking a good technical question that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look into it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:09 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
