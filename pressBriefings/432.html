CDT<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements, so I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw the statement condemning the attack on the school, the U.N. school.\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether the White House feels like Israel is doing enough to prevent civilian casualties?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Nedra.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the United States does condemn the shelling of a U.N. school in Gaza which reportedly killed and injured innocent Palestinians, including children and U.N. humanitarian workers.<br/>\n\tWe are extremely concerned that the thousands of internally displaced Palestinians, who have been called on by the Israeli military to evacuate their homes, are not safe in these U.N.-designated shelters in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 We also condemn those responsible for hiding weapons in the United Nations facilities in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 All of these actions violate the international understanding of the U.N.\xe2\x80\x99s neutrality.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, we first and foremost believe in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s government -- in the Israeli government\xe2\x80\x99s right to and obligation to defend their citizens.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to take military action to provide for that protection.\xc2\xa0 But as you also note, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that Israel needs to do more to live up to its own standards to limit the civilian casualties.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, has there been any response from Israel?\xc2\xa0 Have they taken responsibility for it?\xc2\xa0 Have they expressed regret?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I understand, Roger, that the U.N. has put out a statement on its views.\xc2\xa0 But from our vantage point, we just want to underscore the importance of a full, prompt and thorough investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the Israelis ask for any sort of ammunition to resupply, would the President be willing to authorize any sort of ammunition that we have available for Israelis in Israel?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I do know that we -- part of our commitment to working with the state of Israel is the significant resources we\xe2\x80\x99ve done on the Iron Dome to help Israel protect its citizens.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s an additional request pending in front of Congress, and we hope they move on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, on another subject -- on Russia.\xc2\xa0 It said its Central Bank today would help Russian banks counter the effect of the targeted sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern out of the White House that it would have that effect?\xc2\xa0 That is to say, reduce the impact?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think our focus right now is on the major significant sanctions regime that was announced yesterday by both the Europeans and the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen a significant impact on the Russian economy, on the sanctions that had been in place heretofore.\xc2\xa0 And I think we are just going to let the announcements from yesterday sink in, see what impact they have, and see if they cause President Putin to rethink his strategy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if the Central Bank is going to help them out and subsidize them, that would have some effect, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roger, I\xe2\x80\x99m a lot of things; an economist is not one of them.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let others assess that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Russia -- Russia has said that the complaint that -- the U.S. complaint that it violated the INF Treaty was unfounded and said that it believes that the U.S. production of armed drones are, in fact, violating that treaty.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the White House response is to that, to both those points that Russia has made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what my colleague so eloquently and articulately, Josh Earnest, explained a few days ago on this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not -- because of the nature of the circumstances, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a public position to respond.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about a specific complaint that the production of armed drones are violating the treaty?\xc2\xa0 Can you knock that down, or respond to that in any way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s going to withstand scrutiny.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, the President attacked Republicans today for using taxpayer dollars to launch a political attack on him.\xc2\xa0 How is that different from him using taxpayer dollars to fly here to Missouri and to attack the Republicans?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about what the President did here in Missouri.\xc2\xa0 And I appreciate that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 As you know, last night he met with four letter writers who have written him letters.\xc2\xa0 He receives 10 letters a night -- that\xe2\x80\x99s out of the thousands that the White House receives from average folks around the country who share with him the economic -- well, who share with him lots of things, amongst them the challenges that they face.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President got an opportunity to speak yesterday with folks about the economic challenges that they face every day, the opportunities that they see before him.\xc2\xa0 And that is really what drives the President when he\xe2\x80\x99s back in Washington every single day.\xc2\xa0 And so that is why I think you see him working to raise the minimum wage, help alleviate the burden of college tuition these days, close the gender pay gap, and really do everything possible to create and expand economic opportunity and create jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President did here in Kansas City.\xc2\xa0 It is also worth noting the contrast with what Republicans are doing back in Washington.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re actually not doing anything to raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything to close the gender pay gap.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything to make college more affordable.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything to cut carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now is suing the President for doing his job and exercising his executive authority.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They\xe2\x80\x99re not only suing him for doing his job, they are doing it on behalf of the taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 Previous lawsuits against the President have cost upwards of millions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the contrast the President was trying to make here in Kansas City.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other small question related to his comments today.\xc2\xa0 He suggested some dissatisfaction with the level of commitment to women on U.S. currency.\xc2\xa0 Will he be actually doing anything tangible to think about ways to promote women on currency?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I did hear those comments, Zack.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to report to you on the faces on our currency right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President also talked about the agenda items that Congress has left to do in this next, like, 36 hours while they\xe2\x80\x99re in town.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration actively working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to try to get this transportation bill done, other things -- the border bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The short answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 These are major priorities for the President both on the Highway Transportation Trust Fund.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about infrastructure and long-term funding.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a patch that needs get through, needs to get approved.\xc2\xa0 We need -- Congress should be fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities to do that in the next few days along with the supplemental on the border spending and along with the VA accountability improvements.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which I think is supposed to pass at three.\xc2\xa0 So something will happen today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We are very optimistic.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the border supplemental, the House has proposed something that\xe2\x80\x99s approximately, like -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t do math -- but very short of what the White House is asking for with the things that I think the White House didn\xe2\x80\x99t want.\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about that?\xc2\xa0 Where does that go from here?\xc2\xa0 Or does it hit a dead end in the next 36 hours?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You might not be good at math, but we can assure you that this bill would make the problem worse, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 If this bill were to become law, young children who cannot defend themselves could be deported without adequate due process.\xc2\xa0 The bill would undercut public safety by creating a backlog that will ultimately require a shift in resources away from deporting known criminals.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The situation on the border is a reminder that our immigration system is broken.\xc2\xa0 And after blocking a bipartisan bill to comprehensively fix our broken immigration system for over a year, House Republicans have once again shown zero interest in being part of the solution.\xc2\xa0 All the while, they\xe2\x80\x99ve booked themselves on cable television talking about the urgency of the situation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the President would not sign that if it ever made it to him?<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you that, again, as my colleague Josh Earnest so eloquently articulated yesterday, we have serious objections with that bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, a housekeeping question.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to HUD tomorrow for remarks.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news to preview on that at this time.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we are pleased that the Senate confirmed the President\xe2\x80\x99s HUD nominee.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Castro is looking forward to getting to work and that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of business to be done on that front.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that what the remarks are about tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have remarks to preview for you right now.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be news tomorrow at HUD on that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to preview for you right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, did the President\xe2\x80\x99s frustration that he was expressing with Congress today, I mean, does that extend to the Democratic-controlled Senate as well as the House?\xc2\xa0 For instance, the Senate hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really run with his tax inversion idea.\xc2\xa0 Is he frustrated with the Democratic-controlled Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Nedra, I think there has been some movement on the inversions piece, both in the Senate and in the House.\xc2\xa0 We encourage that process.\xc2\xa0 We want them to move on that faster.\xc2\xa0 I know the Senate has taken action on a supplemental that would do a lot more to address the problem at the border.\xc2\xa0 So we actually do see some progress on that front.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President being briefed on the Ebola outbreak in Africa?\xc2\xa0 And will it be addressed at the Africa summit and/or alter the Africa summit in any way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we continue -- well, no, it will not alter the summit, but we do continue to monitor the outbreak of the Ebola virus in Guinea, in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria closely.\xc2\xa0 The President is indeed receiving regular updates, including speaking with his Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor Lisa Monaco as early as yesterday before departing Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The U.S. government, including the Departments of State, Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control, USAID and the Department of Defense, continue to provide a range of support and assistance to those countries and multinational organizations responding to the outbreak.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This includes the provision of personal protective equipment and other essential supplies, public health messaging and technical expertise.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been engaged in this outbreak since March.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, our response has been ratcheted up in the past few weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of the two Americans who have contracted the disease?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And as the CDC has said, this is not a risk to the United States at this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about that.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House at all worried, though?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the U.K. expressed today concern about the spread of the disease.\xc2\xa0 How worried is the White House and the administration that the virus could make its way to the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, as I said, we are aware of the reports that U.S. citizens have been diagnosed with the virus.\xc2\xa0 We have no higher priority than the protection of U.S. citizens overseas.\xc2\xa0 But again, as the CDC has stated, there\xe2\x80\x99s no significant risk to the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the summit, I would tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with regional governments to stem the spread of the virus.\xc2\xa0 We have no plans to change any elements of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, as we believe all air travel continues to be safe here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if all the leaders are still going to come?\xc2\xa0 Or will some of them be forced to stay back because of the severity of the situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m responsible for a lot of things; the travel of African leaders is not one of them.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check in with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We good?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any response to the 4 percent growth in the GDP, but in the surprising upward tick in the numbers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 We believe that this is the latest indication of a strengthening economy.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s report found that GDP increased 4 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2014.\xc2\xa0 This strong growth is consistent with the recent further improvements in the labor market and other indicators.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the President said today, though, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to be doing.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we find it unfortunate that the House of Representatives is not focused on creating jobs or growing the economy, but rather on a taxpayer-funded lawsuit aimed at the President for doing his job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Republicans today announced a new slate of measures that they say are targeted at women and families and the economy.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any -- have you guys seen anything about that or have any reaction?\xc2\xa0 It was happening during the speech.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take a look at them.<br/>\n\tThank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:01 P.M.
