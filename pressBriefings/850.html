Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:12 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good day, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements, so let\'s get started.</p>\n<p>\n\tAssociated Press -- Ken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney\'s campaign is promoting a number of steps on energy today.\xc2\xa0 Some of the goals that they\'re laying out are creating more than 3 million jobs through increased energy production, energy independence by 2020.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that some of these goals are feasible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President believes is that we need to pursue a policy that embraces a bold and robust all-of-the-above approach to energy.\xc2\xa0 And what we know is that the policy the President has pursued has led already to the doubling of production of renewable energy from sources like wind and solar since the President took office.\xc2\xa0 We know that under his leadership and during his presidency domestic production of oil and gas -- natural gas -- has increased, and our reliance on imports of foreign oil has decreased to its lowest level in I think something like 16 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think what distinguishes the President\'s approach, all-of-the-above approach to our energy future from the Republican approach is that the Republican approach is essentially one that is written by or dictated by big oil and focuses almost entirely on oil and fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis President believes we need to embrace all forms of domestic energy production, including oil, including natural gas, including nuclear energy -- which, as you know, this administration has invested in for the first time in 30 years -- including renewables like wind and solar.\xc2\xa0 And while the Republican approach denigrates forms of energy like wind, this President believes that investing in renewable energy is essential to enhancing our energy independence.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would note, as the President did last week, that I think Congressman Ryan has called wind energy a fad, and I think maybe Mitt Romney -- Governor Romney called it imaginary.\xc2\xa0 This is a narrow view and a dangerous view if you think about how important energy security is and domestic production of energy is to our national security interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this President will continue to push for an all-of-the-above energy approach that ensures that we aggressively pursue domestic oil and gas production, that we aggressively pursue renewable energy production and make the investments necessary to secure our future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the components include increased drilling off the coast of Virginia or Florida, increased energy production on federal lands.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- does the President think there\xe2\x80\x99s a place in an American energy policy for some of these ideas that Governor Romney is proposing today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that, as you know, Ken, under the President, we have increased production on federal waters and lands.\xc2\xa0 The administration just finalized a plan that will build on the millions of acres we have made available for production offshore in the last year alone by making 75 percent\xc2\xa0 -- 75 percent of offshore resources available for production.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, again, if you look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s record, he has been very aggressive in pursuing ways to increase domestic production of energy.\xc2\xa0 He has done it also in a way that is mindful of the need to produce in a safe and reliable fashion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne other point that I would note is that, again, representative of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach, all-of-the-above approach on energy is that we have now more coal miners employed in this country than we have had in the past 15 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this President believes that America\xe2\x80\x99s national security and energy independence depends on a complete all-of-the-above approach.\xc2\xa0 And it depends not on focusing solely on domestic oil and gas production and big oil, and insisting on continuing oil and gas subsidies while ending, for example, the production tax credit -- the wind energy tax credit that is so important to the development of the wind energy industry in this country, as the President talked about last week and which, as you know, his opponents in this election oppose, despite the fact that Republicans in key states where wind energy is important support extending that wind energy tax credit.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 So I wanted to ask you about the report yesterday from the CBO about the fiscal cliff,\xc2\xa0 which said that Americans should expect a significant recession and 2 million job losses if the spending cuts and tax hikes go through.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say that the President believes in a need for a balanced approach to resolving this question and that Congress needs to act because it\xe2\x80\x99s an important one.\xc2\xa0 What I wanted to ask was whether you anticipate any kind of formal process to get that rolling ahead of the election, maybe similar to what the Vice President led on the Hill last year, or if the President is comfortable or thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s more practical to wait until after the election to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been ready and remains ready to come to an agreement on a balanced approach to our fiscal challenges at any time that Republicans demonstrate a willingness to accept the simple proposition that, in addition to spending cuts and in addition to entitlement reforms, revenue has to be part of it, as the Simpson-Bowles commission made clear, as the Domenici-Rivlin commission made clear, the Gang of Six and every other bipartisan group that has looked at this has made clear.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Republican intransigence, their insistence that millionaires and billionaires get tax cuts, has prevented the completion of an agreement on a balanced plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we do know, however, going to the CBO report, is that the single biggest component of the so-called fiscal cliff is the middle-class tax cuts that Republicans and Democrats all agree ought to be extended.\xc2\xa0 The Senate passed a bill that extends these middle-class tax cuts -- tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 The House ought to do the same.\xc2\xa0 And just by doing that, we could alleviate some of the concern about the so-called fiscal cliff -- which should not, regardless, take any pressure off Congress from the absolute need to act, but it should demonstrate to the American people the ability of Congress to come together and pass something that everyone says they agree on and the President agrees on.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, that would -- that is the single biggest component that makes up the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 If they pass that tax cut tomorrow, that would go a significant way towards alleviating concerns about the fiscal cliff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think given everyone is very busy campaigning and so on, and the absence of a formal setting to discuss it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President told you earlier this week when he stood right here that it is -- he recognizes the fact that because Congress I believe will be in town for less than two weeks between now and the election, that significant progress with Congress may not be all that likely.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are things, however, that Congress absolutely must do -- steps to ensure that we pass a continuing resolution that the government continues to function, there are no threats of shutdowns, and other things they can do.\xc2\xa0 But they could also -- because so much work has been done on it already and the Senate has already passed it -- they could pass this tax cut in a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\xc2\xa0 The House could do it when they come back and demonstrate to the American people that there is a seriousness of purpose here when it comes to recognizing the need to address some of the issues that were presented by the CBO report yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so just a final thing, just to clarify -- so then the idea is then after the election will be the time to address the rest of the fiscal cliff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is open to -- and has said so -- any indication from Republicans that they are willing to drop their intransigence on this fundamental issue of whether or not we will move forward with a balanced plan.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a point of argument and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just well, the President believes we have to have a balanced plan and these bipartisan commissions all believe we have to have a balanced plan, every expert out there who\xe2\x80\x99s independent believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason why everyone agrees on this is because the consequences of not having a balanced plan are embodied in the Republican budget proposal, which in order to achieve the kind of deficit savings that are needed, would unfairly burden America\xe2\x80\x99s seniors by voucherizing Medicare, and cause huge reductions and investments in education and innovation, research and development -- the kinds of things that are fundamentally important to our further economic growth in this century.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to pursue that.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to ask seniors to pay $6,400 a year -- per annum -- unless we believe that the right approach is to adopt a Republican plan that asks seniors to pay $6,400 a year, on average, extra to cover their health care costs because we\xe2\x80\x99re voucherizing Medicare so that we can pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest among us.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not sound economic policy.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do it.\xc2\xa0 We need a balanced plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tAdam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 It was announced this week that Cardinal Timothy Dolan will be delivering a prayer at the RNC, and I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s someone that the White House has reached out to on various issues.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate that he be speaking at the Republican Convention, or do you have any feelings on how it might affect the working relationship with the Cardinal or the association he represents moving forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition of religious leaders giving prayers or invocations at conventions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a problem with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also had a question -- there\xe2\x80\x99s some article circulating around DHS and the FBI about some possible anarchist activity at both the RNC and the DNC.\xc2\xa0 I know this is probably something that should be handled by the law enforcement community, but is there advice that the White House is giving to members who live -- residents who live in the area or anything that -- in relation to activities who aren\xe2\x80\x99t attending the convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the reports that you mentioned, and certainly it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be for the White House to issue law enforcement guidance.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to local law enforcement officials as well as federal law enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, I know that this is -- I think you were asked about this earlier in the week, but there\xe2\x80\x99s been a push from the online Homebrewers Association for the White House to release its beer recipes.\xc2\xa0 I believe there are three, at least, White House beers brewed here.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any plans to release its beer recipes?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s true that -- (laughter) -- it\xe2\x80\x99s true I don\xe2\x80\x99t always bring water out here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The paper cup.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware.\xc2\xa0 I think the President and First Lady were asked about this a little bit in an interview last week, which I believe is published or broadcast, about how the White House beer came about.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any plans at this time to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about transparency?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- divulge the secret recipes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe there have been Freedom of Information Act filed on this issue.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question -- examine it, taste it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Budget Office report is a pretty dire warning about what this nation faces, and yet I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the President mention it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason why?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I put out a statement, which is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view and the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 The President talks every day that he\xe2\x80\x99s out there, as he was yesterday, about what we need to do to help build our economy, help it to continue to grow, help it to continue to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday and the day before, he was focusing on the need to continue investments in education because he firmly believes that education is a matter of our economy, that it is an economic issue, and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not really what the Congressional Budget Office was addressing.\xc2\xa0 They were talking about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, sure, about the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I heard the President -- yes, the President talked about education, he talked about Todd Akin, he talked about Michael Jordan, he talked about a lot --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, and he talks, as you know, all the time about what we need to do specifically to help the economy grow and create jobs, and his belief that we need to take a balanced approach to address the kinds of fiscal challenges that are necessary.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the so-called fiscal cliff that the CBO report addressed, as you know, is being brought about by a vote of Congress, with bipartisan majorities in each house, to enact the Budget Control Act, which the President signed into law, which is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not an innocent bystander here.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting he is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess here\xe2\x80\x99s the question:\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President is showing as much economic leadership on this issue as he could be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think that what I talked about in answer to an earlier question is that, look, we recognize that there is an enormous debate, a big conflict between the President and the Republican leadership in particular over whether or not we need to extend and, in some plans, give even greater tax cuts to the top 2 percent of American earners, the most well-to-do Americans.\xc2\xa0 That debate is unlikely to be resolved between now and the election.\xc2\xa0 The President talks about how in many ways the voters will help resolve it by the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we can agree on -- and this goes right to the issue of the fiscal cliff -- is that we should absolutely extend tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans and 97 of American small businesses tomorrow, or the day that Congress gets back.\xc2\xa0 And that would demonstrate to the American people and to people around the world that despite our differences on some very important issues, we can come together and do the practical thing and the sensible thing to help our economy grow, to avert some of the concern over the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that would give people a lot of reassurance about the capacity of their leaders in Washington, after the election, to continue to address the challenges and to ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to -- that the sequester does not come about\xc2\xa0 -- because it was never designed to take effect.\xc2\xa0 It was designed to be so onerous that it would force action, and hopefully that will take place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we do know is that we agree on this:\xc2\xa0 The middle-class tax cuts -- which I think this is a little-known fact -- are the single biggest component of the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 If we pass that, that would have a very positive impact on both\xc2\xa0 -- in the raw number sense, but also I think psychologically, because it would demonstrate that Washington is willing, despite the partisan differences here, to do the right thing by the American people and by the American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President on Capitol Hill telling --</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that anybody is up on Capitol Hill, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s position --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President talking -- even talking about this?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 He has -- he talks about this frequently.\xc2\xa0 He talks about it all the time.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he was focusing on education the last couple of days, but numerous speeches in the last several weeks he talks very much about -- I mean, you saw him repeatedly talk about the need to extend middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m standing here today speaking for him and for the White House and the administration, talking about the need to do that.\xc2\xa0 And we would welcome in a heartbeat a willingness by Republican leaders in the House to schedule and pass -- schedule a vote on and pass an extension of the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then we could all agree that our differences on the remaining 2 percent remain, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t agree on that issue, and that that might have to be dealt with after the election.\xc2\xa0 But if we took that action on the 98 percent, it would demonstrate a seriousness of purpose, and it would be very helpful to both the American people who would have that assurance and certainty about their tax cuts -- 98 percent of the American people -- and to the economy writ large.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on the energy question.\xc2\xa0 Why do you and the President continue to refer to it as an all-of-the-above energy approach when there are certainly components that Republicans are pushing for that you reject, such as the Keystone pipeline or other things?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the Keystone pipeline is a -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t rejected anything.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a process that\xe2\x80\x99s underway at the State Department that was delayed for two reasons:\xc2\xa0 one, because of concern by folks in Nebraska, including a Republican governor, about the original proposed route; and then because of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s -- the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 insistence on including it as part of the payroll tax cut extension.\xc2\xa0 That is a specific issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe all-of-the-above approach is -- as you know, this administration has approved other pipelines, including transnational pipelines.\xc2\xa0 It has approved expanded drilling, both on water and on land, federal and public.\xc2\xa0 It has approved --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you mean types of energy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that every single project imaginable that would require some sort of federal approval has necessarily.\xc2\xa0 But every form of energy has enjoyed the very aggressive support of this administration, and that includes nuclear, wind, solar, and biodiesel and, as you know, oil and gas.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question on CBO saying we might be on the verge of another recession?\xc2\xa0 To his point, with nothing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s public schedule today, why no meetings at all with congressional leaders?\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had meetings with them in weeks if not months.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think you know that congressional leaders have been -- Republican leaders have been very clear that they will hold hostage tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people to their insistence that millionaires and billionaires get tax cuts, too.\xc2\xa0 They could change their mind about that, agree with not just the President and not just Democrats, but the vast majority of people -- and my guess is 98 percent would like to have their tax cut next year -- if they simply said, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s agree to disagree on the 2 percent, let\xe2\x80\x99s pass the 98 percent -- let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done.\xc2\xa0 And that would, in a single stroke, address a significant portion of the concern about the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 It would not entirely deal with it, but it would have a significant impact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President was out there and will continue to be out there calling on Congress to take action on the middle-class tax cut, extending it for 98 percent of American taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, hopefully, Republicans will, for two reasons -- one, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for the economy and for the American people, and two, because of political pressure -- reevaluate their position, take advantage of the few days that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually back in Washington, when they are back, to pass this bill that we all agree should be passed and made law.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President himself has previously said, why raise taxes on people during an economic slowdown?\xc2\xa0 And so, while you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the ones for the middle class and the 98 percent there, there is still -- the Republican view has been again and again that you say they\xe2\x80\x99re hardened on is that if you raise taxes on the wealthy then you\xe2\x80\x99re going to add to the economic slowdown.\xc2\xa0 So we know what their view is, we know what your view is.\xc2\xa0 My question is, why are they not in a room trying to negotiate, which is what Presidents and leaders normally do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think what -- again, we are clearly at loggerheads when it comes to the top 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 We are in total agreement when it comes to the 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 It stands to reason that we should be able to agree on what we agree on and then continue to debate on what we disagree on.\xc2\xa0 And it is I think unhelpful to the economy and certainly not useful for the American people to insist that 98 percent of you won\xe2\x80\x99t get a tax cut unless the top 2 percent of the well-to-do Americans get a tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this, you know his position.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been his position for a long time.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is -- and economists will tell you this -- that a tax cut for middle-class Americans has far greater positive economic impact than a tax cut to people in the top 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily spend it and inject it back into the economy.\xc2\xa0 It just does not have the same macroeconomic impact.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when you\xe2\x80\x99re weighing what we need to do to help the economy grow as we deal with our deficits, we simply can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to spend that extra trillion dollars over what would be 10 years, potentially, on another tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 Some of the very leaders in Congress today, Republican leaders in the House, stood before us -- I was a reporter then -- and declared on the eve of the vote for the Clinton budget, the Bill Clinton budget in 1993 that raised marginal tax rates on wealthier Americans, that it would cause a recession if they passed that bill and signed it into law, that it would cause economic decline, it would cause job loss.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think we can all agree that they were wrong -- because what we got instead was sustained economic growth, significant job creation -- 23 million, 24 million jobs, and the only time in our lifetimes when the budget has been balanced.\xc2\xa0 And millionaires and billionaires coined at a rapid pace.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is you have to have a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 We need tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford tax cuts for the wealthiest.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a view on this book by a Navy SEAL who is going to come out and talk about the bin Laden raid?\xc2\xa0 The book is going to be published I believe on the 9/11 anniversary.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be some concern at the Pentagon and the CIA that somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s got that kind of intimate knowledge is going to put it into a book.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House share that concern?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think one of my colleagues here noted yesterday, we were unaware of this book until yesterday and the press reports about it.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it, and would refer you to the Defense Department, since it\xe2\x80\x99s apparently or supposedly written by someone in the military or retired.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything else about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times is reporting today that this administration has close ties to Exelon, which may have helped foster greater access to the upper reaches of this administration, may have been proven helpful in terms of securing some grants and loans.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to this report?\xc2\xa0 Is it a fair report?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The truth is that Exelon has a long history of supporting politicians of both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 And as you -- most of your who have covered the rule-making process, you know that these decisions on grants are made on the merits.\xc2\xa0 And as Cass Sunstein said in the story, it would be a huge mistake to draw any link between the number of meetings that OIRA, the agency that he headed until recently, holds with outsiders and the outcome of any rule.\xc2\xa0 In fact, OIRA meets with any entity that asks for a meeting.\xc2\xa0 That is there policy.\xc2\xa0 And for the standards listed, OIRA also met four times with the Sierra Club, three times with the American Lung Association, and three times with the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, it is standard policy at OIRA to meet with anyone who asks for a meeting who has an interest in any of these issues that come before OIRA.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the assertion, though, create a negative optic for the President as he heads into kind of the final stretch --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s support for an all-of-the-above approach to energy and to renewable energy is an issue in this campaign.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one that he\'s proud to have be an issue, as you noted when he was out in Iowa last week and has spoken about elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 He firmly believes that our energy future in this country will be more secure, and therefore our national security will be enhanced if we pursue policies that expand domestic oil and gas production, that aggressively invest in and expand renewable energy sources, that make investments, as this administration has, in nuclear energy -- that this is the way -- this is an approach that we have to take.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously Republicans have made an issue of this and it is one that he is very happy to debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this story doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily call into question his views on an all-of-the-above approach, but more so his ties to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My reading of the story, the story simply said -- the big assertion in the story is that people from this company had meetings at OIRA.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m telling you is that any entity that asks for a meeting with OIRA, that has an interest in or is a stakeholder in any of these standards or rules, gets a meeting.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not sure what the issue is, frankly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, I just want to ask you -- yesterday, Josh Earnest said of Ban Ki-moon\'s visit to Iran to attend the meetings there, that he hopes that he will encourage the Iranian regime to live up to their international obligations.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House encouraged the Secretary General to directly voice this concern with the Iranian regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if that conversation has taken place.\xc2\xa0 I think that what Josh said yesterday -- and I\'ll reiterate today -- is certainly our position, and it is well known, which is that we believe that the Iranians use this kind of forum for propaganda purposes and we would ask participants to take advantage of that forum to press upon Iran the need to abide by its international obligations or face further isolation and further sanctions for refusing to abide by their international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott -- and then, Roger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things, Jay -- one, do the differences between the administration and the GOP on energy also extend to the demand side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know about demand, per se.\xc2\xa0 But one thing I did not bring up -- one step this President took, standing with the CEOs of more than a dozen automobile companies, was to raise fuel-efficiency standards, double them over the course of a number of years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, that will have a tremendous impact not just on Americans and their pocketbooks and wallets in terms of the cost of fuel and how much they spend on it, and that will be significant savings for the American people -- it will also enhance our energy independence by reducing our demand on oil and, therefore, demands for foreign oil imports.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think leading Republicans, let\'s say, have been very critical of this decision, despite the fact that it was reached in agreement with -- voluntarily by more than a dozen automobile manufacturers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, did the CBO report yesterday tell us anything about the fiscal situation that we haven\'t known really since the super committee failed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it -- they make periodic revisions.\xc2\xa0 And I think that they have now taken into account since the last time they looked at this all the economic data that has been provided and what\'s happened in the economy since. But I don\'t think that it tells us anything surprising in the sense that we know we have to take action to address our fiscal challenges in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know we need to take action to ensure that the so-called sequester doesn\'t take effect.\xc2\xa0 And it requires a little will and backbone by Congress to agree to the fundamental premise that is widely supported around the country that we need to tackle these issues in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And at least prior to that, even as we acknowledge that we will debate some of these issues beyond the election, we can take action immediately to pass the tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people that would go a significant distance down the road towards addressing the fiscal cliff.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ken mentioned this at the top, but I wanted to get a little further.\xc2\xa0 One of Romney\'s energy plans today has to do with giving states control of oil and gas on federal lands.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not aware of that specific proposal and I\'m not, frankly, as steeped in the details in terms of how these processes work.\xc2\xa0 I know that this President has aggressively expanded oil and gas production in this country, but in a way that he believes protects the health and safety of our lands and waters and, of course, of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I was getting at the state --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of that particular provision in the Governor\'s proposal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to ask you some questions about Isaac as it relates to Haiti and as it relates to the United States.\xc2\xa0 The United States, along with the world body, are working to try to fortify, rebuild Haiti, and Haiti is right in the path of Isaac. What is this administration doing as it relates to preparing for Haiti with Isaac\'s approach upon the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, right now the administration through FEMA has been in close contact with local officials and emergency managers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as the Florida Emergency Management Agency.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, that\'s because these are American lands and territories.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are monitoring the storm -- FEMA is and NOAA -- and are very mindful of the suffering that Haiti has endured because of the earthquake, and will I\'m sure be prepared to assist Haiti if it does suffer under this hurricane.\xc2\xa0 But I think we need to step back and acknowledge that we don\'t know what direction the hurricane -- or the tropical storm, if it becomes a hurricane, will take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think I saw Administrator Fugate on television discuss this and say we need to make sure that everyone who could potentially be affected by the storm, whether it\'s in Puerto Rico or the Florida Keys or anywhere on other U.S. coastland, be prepared and make sure they\'re paying attention to updates on where the storm is and how strong it is and where it\'s headed.\xc2\xa0 And FEMA is working very closely with all the appropriate agencies to do that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you understand why I ask about Haiti, because Haiti is still trying to come back just to the basic piece of where they were before they had that massive earthquake.\xc2\xa0 And you still have people living in camps.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Haiti is still --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I completely appreciate the question and agree with the assessment of Haiti -- what it has endured and what its vulnerabilities are.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps the State Department can help you with more on what Haiti might be doing to prepare for a potential storm.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\'m not briefed well enough to know what the odds are that Haiti would be affected.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President still get updates on Haiti, even though I mean we\'re several years out now from the earthquake?\xc2\xa0 Does he get regular updates on Haiti?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I know that he does periodically from the NSC and the director within the NSC that has that -- has Haiti within its area of responsibility.\xc2\xa0 But I couldn\'t tell you when the last time he got an update on it was or the situation there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\'s see, all the way -- yes, in the back.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, almost in the back, three from the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President has understandably been talking a whole lot about education and the economy.\xc2\xa0 But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard much about the plan for the next four years for the war in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And so I guess I wanted to ask a two-part question.\xc2\xa0 First of all, what is the plan for the next four years?\xc2\xa0 And, second of all, there\'s some chatter that the reason it hasn\'t been discussed is because Governor Romney and the President essentially agree.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t speak for Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0 I think that he has been critical of what the President has made very explicit is his strategy and his policy in Afghanistan, which is, having kept his promise to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home, he has refocused -- he refocused attention on the effort in Afghanistan, which, after all, we entered -- U.S. troops entered because of the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.\xc2\xa0 He refocused attention.\xc2\xa0 He plussed-up our forces there.\xc2\xa0 He developed a strategy that made clear that our number-one priority, the reason why we are in Afghanistan, is because of al Qaeda, and that our number-one objective for our mission in Afghanistan is to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al Qaeda, and that all other objectives that are secondary to that help support the primary objective.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs part of the very detailed proposal that he\'s put forward and that has been endorsed by our ISAF partners, we are now beginning to draw down U.S. forces from Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And that process continues.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, by 2014, we will have fully transferred security lead to Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 And this President believes that\'s the right policy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s his policy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to Governor Romney for Governor Romney\'s policy, if he has one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dick.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the White House have any comment about the lawsuit filed today by immigration agents in federal court in Texas, trying to stop the President\'s non-deportation policy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s probably one that the Department of Justice would take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin is going to be the Democratic nominee running for U.S. Senate in Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 It will be historic if she wins because she will be the first openly gay person elected to the U.S. Senate.\xc2\xa0 It looks like she is facing an uphill battle against Tommy Thompson.\xc2\xa0 Will the President campaign with Tammy Baldwin in her state?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no campaign announcements, scheduling announcements to make on behalf of the President.\xc2\xa0 The President himself has an election, as you know, in a few short months.\xc2\xa0 But I have no campaign announcements to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything to say about the significance of Tammy Baldwin\'s candidacy, though?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is very significant.\xc2\xa0 I think that what is most significant is that someone qualified, like Ms. Baldwin, is running for that office and would make an excellent senator if elected.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:55 P.M.
