Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:54 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It must be so quiet in here because there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing happening anywhere really. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very quiet day at the White House.\xc2\xa0 In the spirit of that quiet day, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any opening remarks, so, Nedra, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just go straight to the questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A day later, has the White House taken a position on the omnibus spending bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra, you may have seen the statement of administration proposal that was sent shortly before I walked through the door.\xc2\xa0 You did not?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did not get that email.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, would be the answer.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, buckle up then.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll listen to that when you listen to what happens during the briefing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it say?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you read it shortly, but you can also -- I can relate to you what it says.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President on a number of occasions has expressed his concern about economic headwinds emanating from Congress and that there is a significant benefit associated with Congress acting responsibly to pass a budget without the threat of a shutdown, and to do so over an extended period of time, over a full year, because it provides the kind of certainty that\xe2\x80\x99s important to our economy.\xc2\xa0 And that is among the reasons why the President supports the passage of this compromise proposal and would sign it if it arrives on his desk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, you heard me describe it as a compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 Let me describe to you a number of the things that are included in this proposal that we believe merit the President\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xc2\xa0 They essentially fall into three categories.</p>\n<p>The first category is, over the course of this year, the President on at least a couple of different occasions made specific requests for urgent national security items.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the President sought substantial funding to support our efforts to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and to improve our domestic readiness here at home.\xc2\xa0 The proposal includes $5.4 billion to fight Ebola, and that certainly is a development that we are pleased to see.</p>\n<p>The proposal also includes substantial funding, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s request, to support our ongoing efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So we are pleased that there are substantial resources included in this legislation to fight Ebola and to fight ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first category of sort of emergent national security priorities.</p>\n<p>The second category are a range of domestic policy priorities that the President has identified that are supported in this piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 The first thing -- and I mentioned this yesterday -- there is strong support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s early childhood education proposal.\xc2\xa0 There is $750 million in funding to make progress against the goal that the President has set out, which is expanding access to high-quality early childhood education programs for every child in America.\xc2\xa0 This $750 million funding level locks in a funding increase that was originally agreed to last year.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are pleased to see the financial support for those programs continue.</p>\n<p>The second domestic priority is something the President has talked about quite a bit, which is Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 This funding proposal includes double-digit increases for both the CFTC and the SEC.\xc2\xa0 These are two independent regulatory agencies that have a very important role to play and now a larger role to play as a result of the passage of Wall Street reform in terms of protecting the stability of our financial system and of the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>Importantly, on previous pieces of must-pass legislation, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans attempt to add ideological riders that would essentially gut the authority of the CFPB -- the CFPB is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President fought for and created as a result of the Wall Street reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for consumers to have a voice in Washington; that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the CFPB does.\xc2\xa0 And Democrats, with the strong support of the administration, were able to fight off Republican attempts to add riders that would gut the authority of the CFPB.</p>\n<p>The third priority that we are pleased to see is receiving an appropriate level of funding in this compromise proposal is related to our efforts to fight climate change.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased to see that the variety of agencies that are involved in implementing the Climate Action Plan are funded at a level appropriate to perform the functions that they need to perform in order to carry out that strategy that the President laid out earlier this year, and we certainly are gratified by that.</p>\n<p>Importantly -- this is another area where Republicans have identified efforts -- or acknowledged efforts to try to undermine our ability to act on this important priority -- there are no riders included in this legislation that would significantly impair our ability to make progress against some of these climate priorities the President has identified.\xc2\xa0 The President has identified these priorities because it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the health and safety of the American people, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for our ongoing efforts to fight climate change, and it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 If we lay out a clear strategy in advance for trying to deal with the consequences of climate change, we can make the kinds of investments in renewable energy that are good for creating jobs and strengthening economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The third and final category that I will touch on lightly here is that there are two areas at the beginning of this budget process that Republicans identified as significant targets for them.\xc2\xa0 These are two areas that Republicans have long opposed administration action and these are two areas where the administration has been very focused on following through in terms of implementation to make sure that we can make progress in these areas.\xc2\xa0 And those two areas are the Affordable Care Act and immigration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this compromise proposal does not include riders that would significantly gut the President ability to implement the Affordable Care Act, or to implement the executive actions that would reform our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So those are the reasons that we believe that -- those are just some of the reasons that we believe that this compromise proposal merits bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and hopefully will arrive on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk in the next few days.\xc2\xa0 If it does, he will sign it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is very different than what some of the Democrats on the Hill are saying.\xc2\xa0 Some of them are angered and speaking of opposing this bill.\xc2\xa0 Is the President or the White House encouraging them to vote for it?\xc2\xa0 And if they oppose it, do you fear that you could be in a worse position negotiating in a new year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, I think the message that you just heard from me about the reasons that the administration supports this legislation is -- I think are reasons that we believe that Democrats should give careful consideration to as they vote their conscience.\xc2\xa0 Somebody asked me yesterday how we thought the Democrats should vote on this thing.\xc2\xa0 Our position yesterday is the same as it was today, which is we believe the Democrats should vote their conscience.\xc2\xa0 If there are Democrats who do choose to support this piece of legislation, there\xe2\x80\x99s ample reason for them to do so.\xc2\xa0 But again, that will be their decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As it relates to a future negotiating position, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the amount of leverage that Democrats have on Capitol Hill will be reduced as a result of the Republicans gains that were made in the last midterm election.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not an eventuality that we\'re pleased by, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s the answer to your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically, they\xe2\x80\x99re angered by a couple provisions, predominantly the rollback of Dodd-Frank and the political contributions.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on those parts of this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President opposes both of them.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall -- and I can explain to you why if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to the Wall Street reform provision that has attracted a lot of criticism among Democrats on Capitol Hill, that is a provision that the President strongly disagrees with as well.\xc2\xa0 In fact, when this provision was put on the floor in a standalone measure in the House of Representatives, this administration put out a statement of administration position indicating the President\xe2\x80\x99s opposition and indicating the President\xe2\x80\x99s intent to veto that proposal if it arrived on his desk.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve been very clear for some time now that we do not support that provision.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the campaign finance proposal that\'s included in here, that is also a provision that the administration does not support.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is slightly different.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken at length in a variety of settings about concerns that he has about our campaign finance system in this country.\xc2\xa0 He believes that it\'s in need of significant reform, particular in light of the landmark Supreme Court decision from three or four years ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So if we\'re going to reform that system we should have a public debate about it.\xc2\xa0 There should be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate to engage in a debate about it.\xc2\xa0 And reforms to that broken system shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be tucked into a 1,600-page must-pass bill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the best way to for us to try to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>But more broadly -- this sort of goes back to the first point that I made today -- this is a long bill -- 1,600 pages.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of different provisions in it.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of funding provisions, some ideological riders that are included in here that the President does not support, but it is a compromise.\xc2\xa0 It is why Democrats and Republicans can support this piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that Democrats and Republicans will support this piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>They will do so not because either side got every single thing that they wanted; the President certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything that he wanted.\xc2\xa0 If the President were writing this bill himself, this bill would look a lot different.\xc2\xa0 But it is a compromise and it does fulfill some of the -- many of the top-line priorities that the President himself has long identified, and passing this bill and signing it into law would allow us to make additional progress against those priorities.</p>\n<p>Jeff.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to shorten my answers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the backup plan if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end up on the President\xe2\x80\x98s desk?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, Jeff, I think I made -- judging myself here, I think I made a pretty persuasive case at least about why I think a lot of Democrats can support the legislation.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that there are a lot of Republicans who will be supporting this legislation, in spite of what I said.\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay, too.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how our democracy works. It means that Republicans have taken a look at this legislation and identified things in that bill that they think are good for the country.\xc2\xa0 We do have a disagreement about them, but we can\'t allow a disagreement over one thing to be a deal-breaker over all the others.\xc2\xa0 I think this is a pretty good illustration of that principle that the President has been discussing for a few weeks now in the aftermath of the midterm elections.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Some other brief topics. One, Secretary Lew talked about oil prices today being good for the American economy, but is the White House concerned that the dip in oil prices may hurt the overall world economy as exporters like Saudi Arabia and others are getting less revenue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m certainly no expert in this area, so I wouldn\'t disagree with Secretary Lew.\xc2\xa0 I do think that, just based on my, again, very elemental understanding of this issue, I think that one of the things that\'s actually depressing oil prices is some weakness in other countries that are large consumers of fossil fuels.\xc2\xa0 So there is a little bit of a chicken-and-egg thing, right, that one of the things that\'s driving down oil prices is the weak economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I guess you\'re asking if it could have sort of a reinforcing effect.\xc2\xa0 I think there is some debate about that, about what the actual impact would be.\xc2\xa0 But again, I do think that Secretary Lew is correct when he does indicate that lower energy prices is good for middle-class families and is good for the broader economy.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is one of the reasons that this President has long advocated that we make the kinds of investments that are necessary to make America independent of foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made substantial progress against that goal while the President has been in office, and that\'s because of the all-of-the-above approach that we have taken when it comes to energy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it accurate to say then that the White House is not concerned about lower oil prices?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as we\'ve talked -- when oil prices were sort of at the other end of the spectrum we talked quite a bit about how the White House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of direct control over the price of gas or oil in this country and certainly had minimal influence over the global oil market as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, this is something that we\'re going to closely monitor and we\'re certainly going to be very cognizant of the impact that any changes in the price of oil would have on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s something that we\'ll continue to monitor closely, and Secretary Lew and the department that he runs will obviously be a big part of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just lastly, ahead of John Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s press conference later this afternoon, does the President still have confidence in his CIA Director?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is simply this -- I mentioned this a little bit yesterday, but I\'m happy to repeat it.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan is a dedicated professional who has dedicated his time in public service to protecting the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 That makes him a patriot and it makes him someone who has the full confidence of the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And the President wakes up every morning pleased to know that John Brennan and the men and women of the CIA are at work, using their skills and expertise to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the President is pleased to count him as one of the people who has been a senior member of his national security team since the very beginning of his tenure in office and the President continues to rely on his advice to this day.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw the CIA Director arriving at the White House this morning.\xc2\xa0 Did he meet with the President?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that meeting?\xc2\xa0 And was that specifically to discuss this unprecedented press conference that is happening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Director Brennan participated in the Presidential Daily Briefing today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly unusual for him to do that.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s also going to limit my ability to give you much of a readout of that meeting because the substance of that meeting is just not something I\xe2\x80\x99m in a position to talk about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this press conference he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to say what\xe2\x80\x99s already been said in the CIA statement.\xc2\xa0 So now that he\xe2\x80\x99s publicly going to take questions and state, as we expect, that these methods did produce intelligence, is the White House still refusing to say whether it agrees with his statement on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, we did go through this at some length yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And let me again try to characterize for you what our view is of this.\xc2\xa0 And I think it sort of falls into two categories.\xc2\xa0 The first is simply that -- and this is not just like a philosophical imponderable, this is actually relevant to what we\'re trying to conclude here, which is it is unknowable whether or not specific information that was obtained through the use of an enhanced interrogation technique could not have also been obtained through some other interrogation technique that is in full compliance with the Army Field Manual and other generally acceptable law enforcement techniques.\xc2\xa0 It\'s --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why is the CIA Director saying that?\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you can ask him.\xc2\xa0 But what I -- you asked about the President, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that it is impossible for anyone to know whether or not the use of an enhanced interrogation technique was necessary to obtain a specific piece of information precisely because it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know whether or not you could have obtained that piece of information through other means.</p>\n<p>That\'s important because the use of enhanced interrogation techniques in the mind of the President significantly undermines the moral authority of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned yesterday, regardless of which side of this debate you\'re on, I think everybody agrees that the moral authority of the United States of America is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal that keeps the American people safe.</p>\n<p>It allows us to build strong relationships with allies and partners around the globe.\xc2\xa0 It allows us to work in multilateral settings to ensure that any multilateral agreements that are struck between the United States and a series of other countries reflect the high standard that we have maintained in this country for the treatment of individuals and the respect for basic human rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is a very powerful tool, and the American people and our broader national security benefit from that significantly.\xc2\xa0 And that is why, on his second full day in office, the President outlawed the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, because he believes they undermined our moral authority and therefore prevented us from doing everything that we possibly could to protect the American people and to protect our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t think it creates an uncomfortable rift to have your CIA Director saying this information did yield on that and the White House saying it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know, as well as an uncomfortable message that he agreed with these methods back then and now is still the Director of the CIA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t know -- you should talk to him about his position on this because I don\'t think that he would say that he -- in fact, I think that he has said publicly that he did not agree with these when he was undergoing congressional testimony for this job.\xc2\xa0 So for his position about the use of these techniques, you should check with him.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, he or the individual who serves as his spokesman can best answer the questions that you have about his position on these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will continue to do my best to help you understand, and help the American people understand exactly what the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is on these issues.\xc2\xa0 But I think the most declarative thing that anybody can say about this is that on the President\xe2\x80\x99s second full day in office, he took steps to unequivocally ban the use of these kinds of techniques in his administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard more world reaction and we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say repeatedly -- talking about the moral authority and concerns that those methods would undermine the U.S. in the view of the rest of the world, do you feel that keeping people on from that era, including Brennan -- does that not undermine the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s values in some way?\xc2\xa0 Can you explain that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does not.\xc2\xa0 And I will actually put a finer point on it.\xc2\xa0 The President does believe that the use of those techniques undermine our moral authority around the globe, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has taken such demonstrative steps to rebuild that moral authority.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he outlawed those techniques on his second full day in office.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has strongly supported the release of a declassified version of the executive summary of the report, so that we can be transparent with the American people and the world about our shortcomings and demonstrate our commitment to making sure that it never happens again.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also why the President took steps, again, within the first week that he was here in office to try to put in place reforms so that clear guidance was given to U.S. personnel about the proper treatment of individuals who are in detention and the proper treatment of individuals who were being subjected to interrogation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, those are the kinds of reforms that even at the time didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of attention when they were mentioned.\xc2\xa0 But the irony is, is that when this report was released on Tuesday, it chronicled in excruciating detail the failure to properly implement these programs, the failure to provide proper oversight of these programs, the failure to give clear direction to individuals that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have proper training.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what this administration did -- again, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s second day in office -- initiated the kinds of reforms that provided greater oversight, that provided greater clarity, that provided clear guidelines to ensure that as these individuals were being held and interrogated that it was being done in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our values and consistent with a way that upholds our moral authority around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how does it not -- the question was more how does it not undermine our moral authority to keep people on who were involved during that era.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at least in one way -- one way I can explain that is to tell you that those individuals who are serving the President of the United States right now are not engaged and are not supporting a policy of enhanced interrogation techniques.\xc2\xa0 And the reason they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that is because the President unequivocally banned it on his second full day in office.\xc2\xa0 I suppose if those individuals didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that policy, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be serving the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Richard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 But this ban is good for this administration.\xc2\xa0 We were listening to former Vice President Cheney yesterday saying that he would do it again if he had to.\xc2\xa0 You repeat that the U.S. will never again use these interrogation techniques.\xc2\xa0 How can you guarantee foreign leaders and people around the world that this won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for this administration, but it can -- they can just come back -- the next one, or the next one.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do think a couple of things about this, Richard -- and I alluded to this a little bit in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing as well -- that one of the benefits of having a public debate about this issue is that it informs the public about what our values are and the public is allowed to reach their own conclusions on these matters, and because it\'s ultimately the public that\'s going to decide who the next commander-in-chief is, they\xe2\x80\x99re relevant to this discussion.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that by being so transparent and encouraging and fostering this kind of public debate, it will be very difficult, if any future commander-in-chief chose to do so, to try to roll back this ban that the President has put in place on torture.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that that\'s going to -- I think that will be very, very difficult for any future President to do.</p>\n<p>But I will concede the premise of your question, which is that there is no guarantee that I can offer here about what a future commander-in-chief may decide.\xc2\xa0 But I think the precedent that\'s been set here and the public debate that\'s been set here makes very clear about the commitment of the people of this country and the government of this country to uphold the values that we hold quite dear -- not just because that\'s the right thing to do, but also because we believe that makes us safer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the publication of the report, any calls coming from outside from foreign leaders?\xc2\xa0 Or has the President had to talk about this to anybody?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Richard, I mentioned this a little bit yesterday, and the fact is I\'m not going to be in a position to read out any calls that the President may have had with any foreign leaders on this specific topic.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coming back to the spending bill, Elizabeth Warren said that this bill \xe2\x80\x9cshows us the worst of government of the rich and powerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering, does the President think that Elizabeth Warren is wrong about that?\xc2\xa0 Or is he supporting the passage and willing to sign a bill that, in her words, \xe2\x80\x9cshows us the worst of government of rich and powerful\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it would be fair for you to observe that we might have a difference of opinion about this.\xc2\xa0 The\xc2\xa0 President is pleased that the legislation includes a double-digit funding increase for the CFTC, a double-digit funding increase for the SEC, and does not include any Republican riders which they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to attach to previous pieces of legislation that would essentially gut the authority of the CFPB.\xc2\xa0 I know the CFPB is something that is -- is certainly something that Senator Warren is a strong advocate for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President worked with her to actually create this agency that would be a voice for consumers here in Washington, D.C., and I think that\'s a testament to, again, the reason that the President is supporting this legislation -- not because it\'s perfect, and not because he supports every provision in it.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And he does not -- she\xe2\x80\x99s referring to I think a specific provision in this omnibus that would be related to watering down one provision of the Wall Street reform law.\xc2\xa0 The President does not support that provision.\xc2\xa0 But on balance, the President does believe that this compromise proposal is worthy of his support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another one of the riders you did not mention basically undoes what the voters in the District of Columbia voted for, which was legalizing marijuana.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House position on the fact that Congress, through this bill, would be basically undoing a democratic action, the democratic will of the people of the District of Columbia?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll answer your question.\xc2\xa0 As a general matter, it\'s going to be hard for me to take a position on every single rider that\'s included in the bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a pretty big one, though.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m prepared to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 But just\xc2\xa0 -- as everybody else is thinking through --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I won\'t ask about any others.\xc2\xa0 D.C. marijuana.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 On this one, what I can tell you is that this administration has been a strong supporter of the District of Columbia getting statehood.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an indication that we do not believe that Congress should spend a lot of time interfering with the ability of the citizens of the District of Columbia to make decisions related to how they should govern their community. And this was a specific referendum, I believe, that was on the last ballot, and we do believe that this kind of congressional interference does interfere with this home rule principle of which the President is strongly supportive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, effectively, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this is that because the people of the District of Columbia voted to legalize marijuana Congress should not get in the way.\xc2\xa0 That should go through and we should have legalized marijuana in D.C.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that on principle that members of Congress shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be interfering in this way with the decisions that the citizens of the District of Columbia are making about how they should be governed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then just one other one.\xc2\xa0 You offer your case for why a Democrat should vote for this.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could just kind of put yourself in Republican shoes for a moment -- a spending bill that, as you said, fully funds Obamacare and does nothing to undo the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive order on immigration -- do you want to take a stab as to why Republicans should support such a bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that it fully funds the Affordable Care Act as much as I would like it to.\xc2\xa0 I think Republicans were unsuccessful in putting in place the kinds of riders that would gut our ability to implement the Affordable Care Act substantially.\xc2\xa0 But I grant the premise here.</p>\n<p>What I would say is this.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that there are people who will deliver a much more persuasive case to Republicans than I will be able to do so.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter I can say that I do think that there is strong Democratic and Republican agreement that any sort of government shutdown would be bad for our economy, and that businesses across the country who are trying to make decisions for the upcoming year will benefit from Congress passing a piece of legislation that funds just about the entire federal government through the end of this fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of certainty will be beneficial to business owners who are trying to plan their business expenditures for the remaining of this fiscal year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for our economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that both Democrats and Republicans have placed a significant priority on. And I think that in and of itself is a lot of the reason that Democrats and Republicans should give a close look at this legislation before they decided to oppose it.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Director Brennan in any way suggest to the President what he was going to say?\xc2\xa0 Was the reason for him to be here to get some sort of clearance or guidance from the President about how he should either state his case or answer questions about this CIA report?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that Director Brennan was here for the PDB.\xc2\xa0 I did not ask for a readout of the conversation that they had in the PDB, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How frequently does he participate in that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does not participate in it every time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly unusual for him to be here for the PDB in person.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House feel it was necessary visually to just have a sense that the President supports the CIA Director and have him come over here today, in the aftermath of some questions raised about either, as Michelle raised, the distance between the two parts of the executive branch on this particular question or the future of Brennan himself?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply that I think if we were looking for a public forum in which to demonstrate the President\xe2\x80\x99s support for Director Brennan or we felt it was necessary for the President to publicly demonstrate his support for Director Brennan, we probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have chosen the most secretive meeting in Washington, D.C. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we did see him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s because all of you are careful observers and good reporters and noticed him entering the building.\xc2\xa0 So I compliment you for that.\xc2\xa0 That was not something that we had intended to announce in advance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for that.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier that Hill Democrats will have less leverage next year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an obvious fact.\xc2\xa0 Will the President have less leverage when it comes to early spring next year and he has to negotiate an extension of homeland security funding and deal with what are likely to be more pointed and maybe politically volatile or precise objections to the executive action taken on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The premise of your question, Major, is that there may be some Republicans who will threaten to cease funding for border security, for criminal background checks, and for other elements of our national security infrastructure that are critical to our homeland security just because they\xe2\x80\x99re upset with the President taking executive action on immigration reform.</p>\n<p>I recognize that there has been a passionate response in some Republican quarters to this executive action, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the vast majority of Republicans think it would be a good idea to stop funding for the kinds of personnel and programs that are critical to our homeland security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you will not lose any leverage?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s your position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just -- I think that this will be leverage that the vast majority of Republicans will be unwilling to use, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they will want to be in a position -- maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, and again, I probably have -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not the person you should go to for insight into the thinking of Republicans -- but my sense is that even Republicans would not want to be in a position of saying, you know what, we should stop funding for our border patrol officers who are putting their lives on the line to secure our border just because I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty mad at the President about his executive action on immigration, that thing that he announced about three months ago.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that is a tough case for Republicans to make and I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if they made it, frankly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you were somewhat reluctant to make a pitch to Republicans on why they\xe2\x80\x99d support it.\xc2\xa0 You might have just inadvertently explained to them why they should not support it, because the message being given to Republicans is, we\xe2\x80\x99ll fight another day on this.\xc2\xa0 From your vantage point, the White House\xe2\x80\x99s vantage point, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter when you fight on it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a -- no.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that is an opportunity that\xe2\x80\x99s open to them.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that the vast majority of Republicans will not think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very good idea.</p>\n<p>But again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wrong in making these kinds of predictions before; I might be wrong this time, too.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they will -- if they do choose to have that fight -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they will -- but if they do, I do feel confident in saying they will not have widespread support among the American people for this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the Senate report, you said you welcome a public debate, so I wonder if you could answer one of the questions that Vice President Cheney was sort of posing last night about, put yourself in their shoes after 9/11.\xc2\xa0 He said, when it comes to terrorists, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we supposed to do, kiss them on both cheeks and say, please, please, tell us what you know\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I think this President\xe2\x80\x99s record of fighting terrorists and bringing terrorists like Osama bin Laden to justice are a testament to the seriousness with which the President confronts his responsibility to fight terrorism and protect the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point, James Mitchell was one of the contractors who put the interrogation system together.\xc2\xa0 You probably saw some of his quotes to various news outlets.\xc2\xa0 He said it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely insensible for the President to say that slapping Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is bad, but sending a hellfire missile into a family picnic and killing the children, you know, and killing granny\xe2\x80\x9d is somehow acceptable.\xc2\xa0 We talked about this yesterday, but when one of the people who put together this program is saying that there is a moral divide here, where, on one hand, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying these tactics were horrible, but it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to send a hellfire missile in and kill innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a worthy discussion, and so I appreciate you raising it once again.\xc2\xa0 Ed, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people -- not just your viewers but for people everywhere to understand that when the United States undertakes lethal operations, which we only do as a last resort, the President has emphasized the extraordinary care that is taken to ensure that our counterterrorism actions are carried out in accordance with all applicable domestic and international laws and are consistent with the United States\xe2\x80\x99 values and our policy.</p>\n<p>A particular note -- before any action is taken and before any counterterrorism strike is taken outside the area of active hostilities, there must be near certainty -- this is policy -- there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured, the highest standard that we can set.\xc2\xa0 What that means is it means that the United States considers the death of innocent civilians to be something that should be avoided if at all possible, but in those rare instances in which it does appear that civilians may have been injured or killed, after-action reviews are conducted to determine why and to ensure that the United States is taking the most effective steps to minimize such risk to civilians in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a little bit about why there have not been prosecutions, as well.\xc2\xa0 The ACLU is saying that putting out this report and talking about it is not enough.\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying there should be prosecutions for people who approved these brutal tactics.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it cowardly for the administration to basically say the law was broken, there was torture, and yet we\'re just simply not going to prosecute anyone?\xc2\xa0 If you really believe the law was broken, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President making sure that the law is followed from here on out on torture by prosecuting people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The determination about whether or not the law has been broken is made by a career prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 And federal prosecutors have looked into this.\xc2\xa0 They reviewed all of the evidence, including all the evidence that was considered by the committee that wrote this report.\xc2\xa0 What those federal prosecutors have said is that they did not find sufficient evidence to indict anyone.\xc2\xa0 That is their decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Chris Anders of the ACLU is saying if they really\xc2\xa0 -- if the Justice Department looked at this Senate report, he says there\xe2\x80\x99s 500 pages of crime after crime.\xc2\xa0 The President is basically -- by banning this his second day in office, as you\'ve said over and over, he believes this was against the law.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s now 500 pages in the public domain saying there\xe2\x80\x99s crime after crime.\xc2\xa0 So how can the Justice Department look at that if you really believe that the law was broken here?\xc2\xa0 How could they not --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If you have questions about the Justice Department investigation you should consult with them.\xc2\xa0 The President was not making a legal --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t it common sense, though?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President was not making a legal --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President saying this is outside the law, I had to ban it.\xc2\xa0 And now we have 500 pages saying the law was broken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be real clear about what the President was saying.\xc2\xa0 The President was saying that these tactics were entirely inconsistent with our values as Americans, and that they undermined our moral authority, which is one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President was definitive about that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he outlawed these tactics on his second full day in office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But questions about legality are questions that should be answered by federal career prosecutors, outside of any sort of political influence or interference.\xc2\xa0 This is their decision to make.\xc2\xa0 They reviewed all the evidence.\xc2\xa0 But for the conclusions that they reached and why they reached those conclusions, you should check with them.\xc2\xa0 I do think they would be willing to talk about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President himself weighs in on immigration for example.\xc2\xa0 He said again and again, America is a nation of laws.\xc2\xa0 If the law is broken, why is he not making sure that people pay a price for that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, because the way that our law -- the way that our system of criminal justice works, is that we have federal career prosecutors who are insulated from any sort of political pressure who can go back and look into these matters and dig into them.\xc2\xa0 And they looked at the same evidence that was reviewed by the committee that wrote this report.\xc2\xa0 And you can talk to them about their conclusions and why they reached them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President reached his own conclusion, though, about whether or not these tactics were consistent with American values.\xc2\xa0 He decided that they were not.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why on his second full day in office he unequivocally banned them from use, and has been, ever since, working to rebuild our moral authority around the globe to rebuild the kind of relationships that took a hit as a result of these tactics.\xc2\xa0 And I think because of those efforts and because of our commitment to living up to those values, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made the country safer.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Did the President sign off on Brennan doing this presser?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to any conversations that took place between --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- before today?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was the President aware he was doing it yesterday and did he sign off on it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Frankly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when they announced their news conference.\xc2\xa0 It is not routine for the White House to sign off on every news conference that\xe2\x80\x99s done by a senior member of this administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about him taking this step? It\'s very unusual.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s particularly unusual for members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team to do news conferences.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how often the CIA Director does -- probably less given the nature of his job.\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you that the President continues to be very proud of Director Brennan and his leadership at the CIA.\xc2\xa0 He believes because of his professionalism and expertise, the American people are safer.\xc2\xa0 The President relies on his advice every single day about steps that we can take to protect the country, and protect our interest around the globe.\xc2\xa0 The President is pleased to rely on that advice and is going to continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was there any attempt to either dissuade or encourage him to do this press conference?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a decision that Director Brennan made, and it\'s one that he should make on his own.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed us repeatedly to the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions on his second full day in office, as you said.\xc2\xa0 But one of those points you said that he had outlawed these practices, which obviously begs the question, were they legal before he acted?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well I think -- if I said that, then I was speaking colloquially and perhaps not as precisely as I should have been.\xc2\xa0 He banned those tactics on his second full day in office.\xc2\xa0 The questions about whether or not it was consistent with the law is something that should be determined by a career federal prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not a career federal prosecutor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you cited public opinion as a potential deterrent to a future commander-in-chief acting, but I confess I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the recent polls, but the polls I looked at over the last, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, six years don\xe2\x80\x99t actually show the majority of Americans opposing these kind of techniques when questioning terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering really, what\xe2\x80\x99s the value of that public opinion as a bulwark against these practices returning to -- into the government\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Olivier, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that we benefit from having a public debate, that other Americans that may have had a loosely formed opinion, or maybe no opinion at all, have now, at least for the last two or three days now, been tuned into what has been a pretty robust public debate. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had forceful, good people on both sides of this debate in which we\xe2\x80\x99ve had an extensive discussion about whether the use of these techniques was worth it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President clearly believes that it was not, that the hit to our moral authority was significant, and we are continuing to take the kinds of steps that are needed to try to rebuild it. And the reason for that is that our moral authority does strengthen the national security interest of the United States and of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the moral authority of the United States is something that\xe2\x80\x99s worth protecting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, I think people on both sides of this debate could acknowledge that and would agree with that -- not just acknowledge it, but actually agree with it.\xc2\xa0 And I would acknowledge that not everybody is going to sort of come down the same way that the President has in terms of banning these techniques, but the President I think has a pretty persuasive case to make about how that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the national security interest of the United States, and why he believes that future Presidents should reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, has the President ever sought a formal assessment from the intelligence community about whether the drone program is a net asset, either because of our moral authority, or in terms of creating more enemies than it takes off the battlefield?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not aware of any intelligence assessment like this.\xc2\xa0 You can certainly check with the office of the Director of National Intelligence to see if they\xe2\x80\x99re aware of anything like this that they could talk to you about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 Tamara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding the spending bill, I think we all sat and watched our C-SPAN and saw that the rule barely made it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I figured you were also watching it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did the White House put this out, show of support, in hopes of helping the law -- this bill at a time -- at a moment when it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look that pretty out there on the floor?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 I will say that this -- that the statement of administration policy is something that we obviously had prepared.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not something -- it\'s not as if we saw that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That you wrote in 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 But this administration has been prepared for some time to -- after having sufficient time to review all of the elements of the proposal, to arrive at a decision about whether or not the President would sign it, and then make public that view prior to the floor vote.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is consistent with the way that we\xe2\x80\x99ve handled this in the past.\xc2\xa0 But certainly when there was some doubt about the passage of the rule, that did add a little short-term drama into the situation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see as they start counting noses on both sides about who is going to vote for this thing, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we have additional drama.</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, could you talk to me about the passage in the House and the Senate on the Death and Custody Reporting Act?\xc2\xa0 It\'s when someone dies in police custody and it\'s required now by law to go to -- be reported to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 Now it\'s just waiting for the signature of the President.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to me about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not familiar with this proposal, April, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this something along the lines of what the President had been talking about and the Justice Department has been looking at -- trying to fix this mistrust with the African American community and the police department, to try to put more accountability?\xc2\xa0 Do you think this is something that will give a little bit of accountability to the process so there could be a lessening of mistrust?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, based on the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described it, it sounds like it might.\xc2\xa0 But let me have somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s more familiar with the proposal get back to you, and we can do that today.</p>\n<p>Okay, all right.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Now that the House has passed a bill calling for sanctions against some members of the government of Venezuela for human rights violations, what are the President\xe2\x80\x99s intentions?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to sign it?\xc2\xa0 And does he intend to enforce those sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the question.\xc2\xa0 The administration shares Congress\xe2\x80\x99s concerns and those of other regional and international actors about the situation in Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 We have not and will not remain silent in the face of Venezuelan government actions that violate human rights and fundamental freedoms, and deviate from well-established democratic norms.</p>\n<p>We continue to work closely with Congress and others in the region on this issue to support greater political space in Venezuela, and ensure the government lives up to its shared commitment to the collective defense of democracy as articulated in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\xc2\xa0 The President plans to sign the bill into law, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll coordinate with the relevant agencies and members to implement the law.</p>\n<p>Angela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the Antonio Weiss nomination, there\xe2\x80\x99s been (inaudible) Democratic support to approve him.\xc2\xa0 And obviously in another few weeks, there will be a Republican-controlled Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a change in strategy to try to get him approved given that you\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to paint him as a liberal to get Democratic support and now you\xe2\x80\x99ll need Republican support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that we have actually suggested, Angela, that he has any particular ideological point of view.\xc2\xa0 I do think that we have been candid, though, that he shares the President\xe2\x80\x99s view about steps that can be taken to make our tax code more fair.\xc2\xa0 These are actually views that he\xe2\x80\x99s articulated prior to even being considered for a position in the administration.\xc2\xa0 He wrote a report back in 2012 titled, \xe2\x80\x9cReforming Our Tax System and Reducing Our Deficit,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he discussed the need to simplify our tax code and implement policies that help boost economic growth for the middle class.</p>\n<p>So he is somebody who shares the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that our economy will be strongest and will grow fastest when it grows from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 And his support for that kind of philosophy and for that strategy for growing our economy is one of the reasons that the President has nominated him for this position.</p>\n<p>It also is not lost on anybody in the administration and I think is a testament to his credentials that he is somebody that has a deep working knowledge of our financial markets and of the kinds of economic issues that will be at the top of the to-do list for the next Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who has worked for 20 years in the financial industry.\xc2\xa0 He understands these issues inside and out. So bringing someone to this job that has the right mix of expertise and skill and a strategy -- and is supportive of a strategy that the President has outlined makes him the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 It also makes him somebody who is worthy of strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And I do believe that Democrats and Republicans should come together around his nomination.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact remains he\xe2\x80\x99ll need Republican support in the next Congress to get him approved.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be easier?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that would be true even if every single member of the Democratic caucus said that they were supporting him.\xc2\xa0 And so just because there are a couple members who\xe2\x80\x99ve said that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the need that we\'re going to need some bipartisan support to get him confirmed.\xc2\xa0 The good news is he strongly deserves that bipartisan support, and we\'re looking forward to the opportunity to make that case.</p>\n<p>Justin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In today\xe2\x80\x99s installment of Democratic lawmaker hitting the White House while you\'re up at the podium -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I love that program.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi just said that she\xe2\x80\x99s enormously disappointed that the White House feels that this is the only way to get a bill, that she\xe2\x80\x99s sad for the American people, and that she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t whip support for the cromnibus.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Can you say that last part again?\xc2\xa0 She said what?\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard this so I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that she would not whip support for the cromnibus bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Did she say that she was voting against it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question is twofold.\xc2\xa0 One is your reaction to what she had to say, but also, if you\'re aware of any efforts by the White House to sort of whip support -- especially House Democrats, especially since the bill seems kind of tenuous right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You mean aside from the compelling and persuasive statement that I delivered here today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, any calls from the President or any --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s respect and affection for Leader Pelosi are no secret.\xc2\xa0 The President has worked closely with Leader Pelosi to make progress on a wide range of accomplishments that will be at the top of any list of legislative highlights describing the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy.\xc2\xa0 They would not have been possible without somebody who has the kind of skill and determination and values that Nancy Pelosi does.</p>\n<p>So that said, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that we have a difference of opinion here.\xc2\xa0 And again, as I mentioned yesterday and repeated today, it will be the responsibility of every member of Congress to vote their conscience on this legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has arrived at a different conclusion than the one that you have described as the conclusion that was reached by Leader Pelosi.\xc2\xa0 But for the reasons that I outlined -- the support for key national security priorities, the support for key domestic policy priorities, and the success in fighting off Republican efforts to undermine some of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on other priorities -- is, in the mind of this President, reason enough to support this piece of compromise legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President making calls on this, or are administration officials making calls trying to whip support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think you would anticipate, there have been at least a couple of phone calls between the White House and Capitol Hill today.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a surprise.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there will be additional phone calls, but if additional -- if there are people who want to have a better sense of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view of this legislation, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to have those conversations.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good afternoon.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:45 P.M.
