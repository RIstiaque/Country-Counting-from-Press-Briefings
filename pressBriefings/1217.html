EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, we have a few special guests -- you recognize Austan and Gene -- who are here to talk a little bit about a report we have released today, our innovation strategy, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that in a few seconds.\xc2\xa0 Let me quickly go through the week ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to these guys, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a few questions to them, and then we will get back to our regularly scheduled programming.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will deliver remarks to the United States Chamber of Commerce here in Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday and Wednesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday the President will travel to Marquette, Michigan -- yes, dress warmly; expected high for the day 13\xc2\xb0 -- where local businesses have been able to grow as a result of broadband access, with particular benefit in exporting goods to new markets around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his State of the Union address the President called for a national wireless initiative to help businesses extend the next generation of wireless coverage to 98 percent of the population.\xc2\xa0 The next generation wireless network in Marquette is an effective demonstration of how the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to open up the airwaves will spark new innovation, put people back to work, grow the economy, and help America win the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Friday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, let me first turn it over to Gene Sperling and then to Austan Goolsbee to talk about today\xe2\x80\x99s report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Well, the report on the President\xe2\x80\x99s innovation strategy that we have put out today really just provides a summary of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive innovation strategy, which is a critical part of his economic vision to win the future and will be laid out in more detail as we put our budget out.\xc2\xa0 Since I had a chance to go over a certain amount of these things with many of you on the day of the State of the Union and many of the details will be later, let me just do a sketch of the overall approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously a key aspect will be a significant commitment to research and development.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is -- all has to be done in the context of a budget which is cutting non-security spending to its lowest levels by 2015 since the Eisenhower administration.\xc2\xa0 So these are the priorities that we are still making room for because it is part of his vision for growth and competitiveness for our country going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou will see in the budget a very strong increase, despite that freeze, in basic research across the board, including putting on the path to doubling the funding of National Science Foundation, NIST, or the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Energy\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Science.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs we discussed before, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see an increase to $8 billion in R&amp;D on clean energy technology.\xc2\xa0 That includes a doubling of his new ARPA-E initiative and the doubling of the energy innovation hubs.\xc2\xa0 These are two new innovations that President Obama put forward in his budget that have received very strong reviews, which he will be doubling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then you\xe2\x80\x99ll also see and what you saw this week is more the administration showing the degree that we want to see these things deployed, so they are creating jobs now going forward.\xc2\xa0 You saw that Monday as Austan and I and others, with Steve Case, rolled out the Startup America, which is very much building off the President\xe2\x80\x99s Small Business Job Initiative and connecting of innovation to small businesses and job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou saw that in the Vice President laying out the electric vehicles goal -- the goal of hitting 1 million advanced technology vehicles by 2015 -- and you saw it yesterday when the President actually went to one of the regional innovation hubs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s three -- this one that focuses on building efficiency -- and there announced an aggressive strategy for retrofits and building efficiency in the commercial sector.\xc2\xa0 That included a tax credit which we believe will be maybe even ten times more effective in take-up, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a credit as opposed to deduction, and it goes to companies as they\xe2\x80\x99re making incremental improvement -- the kind of Race to the Green grant program where communities can apply.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a \xe2\x80\x9cFields of Dreams\xe2\x80\x9d approach that if you can build the infrastructure and technology -- for example, electric vehicles -- that those will become more viable in those communities and they can become examples for the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 And you saw that he put forward a goal of reaching 20 percent greater efficiency in commercial buildings and really a call to action, and he asked Jeff Immelt, the head of his new council, jobs council, and obviously CEO of GE, together with former president Bill Clinton, to lead that kind of call to action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the education side, obviously, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us talk before about the goal to have 100,000 new STEM teachers -- science, technology, engineering, and math.\xc2\xa0 And you also see in our report something that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been out before, which is again, to take the same ARPA approach to education so that we\xe2\x80\x99re using the technology -- developing the technology innovations that help kids and adults learn.\xc2\xa0 If we can use technology so well to occupy my 16 year-old at the video games, there is no question that we should have the capacity to do that to help kids learn in a way that keeps us competitive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this week coming up, you will see the more innovative aspects of the President\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure initiative, which, beyond the roads and bridges and railways, focuses on, as Robert talked about, wireless initiative, smart grid technologies, next generation for air traffic.\xc2\xa0 So those are the broad outlines.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me at this point turn it over to Austan, and we will both be around for some questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Gene.\xc2\xa0 The innovation strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re releasing in this report is really based on two parts.\xc2\xa0 Gene outlined the fundamental building blocks -- the education, infrastructure, research and development -- that it rests on.\xc2\xa0 And then the second part of the report is that we must extend the innovation capacity into the private sector.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo extending beyond just the public investments, there are three components in the innovation strategy:\xc2\xa0 an emphasis on small business, the emphasis on startups and new firms, and an emphasis on inventors in the patent system.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSmall businesses:\xc2\xa0 We now see that over the last 17 years of the net new jobs created, more than two-thirds of them were created by small businesses.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why it puts the focus there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Startup America and new firms are an even greater -- of even greater importance to the job engine.\xc2\xa0 We released a whiteboard about Startup America.\xc2\xa0 It is a four-point program to unite public and private sectors to try to help startups in the country by giving them more access to capital; by getting them business mentors to help with their business development; streamlining and reducing regulations that affect small businesses and startups; and continuing the tax relief to startups, which the President has cut taxes for small business 17 times.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The third category are for inventors.\xc2\xa0 The patent system has a 700,000-application backlog.\xc2\xa0 It takes almost three years to get your patent application reviewed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work for small businesses and small inventors for them to be waiting for three years to be able to get a patent on the product that they\'re trying to sell.\xc2\xa0 The strategy will cut that permission time almost in half.\xc2\xa0 And today we are announcing a fast-track patent which will allow inventors to get approval in less than one year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the market-based foundation is small business, startups and inventors.\xc2\xa0 And the basic idea of the innovation strategy is that America has been the great innovative engine of the entire world for many years.\xc2\xa0 We have the majority of the Nobel Prize research.\xc2\xa0 We have the greatest universities.\xc2\xa0 There is no country that has more successful startups than we have, and truly every American deserves a chance to change the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with that I think we can open up to any questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Questions for Austan and Gene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gene, Austan, whoever, these initiatives, the innovation, entrepreneurship, competitiveness are -- seem to be -- kind of have a long-term view toward job creation.\xc2\xa0 And today we see very small job growth last month, more people dropping out of the job market.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about winning the future.\xc2\xa0 What do you have for winning the present?\xc2\xa0 What can you offer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me highlight.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take one step back and talk for one second about the jobs numbers.\xc2\xa0 There are two surveys.\xc2\xa0 One is of people, and that\'s where the unemployment rate comes from.\xc2\xa0 The other is of businesses, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where the payroll employment figure comes from.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everyone now recognizes there was some significant severe weather impact on the business component of how many people were on the job working, and we will learn more about this report from the next two jobs reports than perhaps this report itself tells us.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in the survey of people, the picture is substantially better.\xc2\xa0 The labor force participation rate did not change substantially at all.\xc2\xa0 It is not the case that the reason the unemployment rate fell sharply was because of reductions in labor force participation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In -- startups and small businesses will show up first in the survey of people, because obviously they are not yet in the system to be interviewed about their payroll.\xc2\xa0 So winning the \xe2\x80\x9cright now,\xe2\x80\x9d startups and small business is both a future investment but is also about the here and now, I would say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, as Austan said, this was a very unusual jobs number.\xc2\xa0 And I think the important thing is to look at the -- what we\xe2\x80\x99ll see as the overall trend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a couple of points.\xc2\xa0 One is that, first of all, in terms of things we\xe2\x80\x99ve just done, obviously the passage of what the President passed in his tax cut in December, which is just taking effect right now, will unquestionably have a very positive impact on growth and jobs over what anyone could have expected in December.\xc2\xa0 You see that through $112 billion payroll tax cut, of which this is the first month we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.\xc2\xa0 You see that in terms of the 100 percent expensing, which tells every company in the United States that they can expense 100 percent off of what they are investing this year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those are things that are having a very -- have a strong effect in the here and now right now on accelerating investment and job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, there are important signaling in the policies that you put forward.\xc2\xa0 When you have a commitment to advanced battery technology, when you have a strong commitment to clean R&amp;D and clean technology, that sends an important signal right now to people who have cash on the sidelines that these are national priorities, these are important areas of growth.\xc2\xa0 And when you get these things together, they can have a powerful effect in unleashing investment now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll just give you an example that will be relevant to next week.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversations with some telecom companies, indicate that the fact that we have 100 percent expensing, that several of them are now planning to accelerate their investment.\xc2\xa0 You get that acceleration investment together with a national priority on national wireless to get to 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 Those things come together and can get more people starting to invest in the future, but starting that investment now in a way that can have a strong impact on jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one -- just one thing in today -- even in today\xe2\x80\x99s numbers and the last couple numbers.\xc2\xa0 We have seen some real strength in manufacturing -- 49,000 jobs today -- and I understand this was an unusual jobs report -- but 152,000 over the last year.\xc2\xa0 It has not been since \xe2\x80\x9997 to \xe2\x80\x9998 that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a year period where over 150,000 manufacturing jobs were created.\xc2\xa0 The ISM, the manufacturing purchasing index, as you know, was over 60 for the first time in a very long time.\xc2\xa0 And the employment index on it reached its highest levels since 1973.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we do see in the manufacturing area and the places present we\xe2\x80\x99ll be traveling some good news and I think with some significant relation to policies that the President has implemented and proposed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me first rib Gene for always mentioning when he was last in the White House.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just having fun.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not allowed to mention the whole decade?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just having fun.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just having fun.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also, though -- Gene touched on advanced battery manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 I think this is something that fits in with a future-oriented, innovative agenda, and it goes very directly to out-educating, out-innovating and out-building.\xc2\xa0 Because five years ago, six years ago, it was not thought, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say before as it relates to the auto industry, it was not thought that American workers would build these advanced batteries.\xc2\xa0 It was somewhat unlikely that we\xe2\x80\x99d drive these cars.\xc2\xa0 And if we did, that technology would be imported into this country rather than built by Americans in America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We now know that\'s not the case anymore.\xc2\xa0 I believe the last time the President was in Michigan, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll go next week, was in fact to break ground on yet another advanced battery manufacturing facility to produce batteries for cars that are being built by our auto companies.\xc2\xa0 Some of those cars are being exported.\xc2\xa0 Those cars are being driven today on our roads.\xc2\xa0 And some of those batteries are being exported.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if we don\'t take some of the ideas that are in this report and think about what are going to be the jobs of tomorrow but ensure that the jobs of tomorrow are in this country today, which advanced batteries is a good example of, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a hard time competing both today and in the future.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s one example of something where we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look ahead because we can put people back to work right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gene, Robert mentioned the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech on Monday to the Chamber of Commerce.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could just -- to throw things forward a little bit -- talk about how you think the relationship with the business community is improving in the last couple months, if it is, and what steps maybe these measures or others that you two are undertaking will do to help that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 I think the last few months you have seen a strengthening of confidence across the board.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been signs of greater confidence on consumers in the consumer index.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been greater signs of increased confidence among the business community.\xc2\xa0 And I think what a lot of Americans want to see is that -- and as we are fighting our way out of the very deep, deep hole this President inherited -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to work together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think in December really was a turning point because the failure to have worked together would have created a degree of uncertainty in the month that we\xe2\x80\x99re in now, or in January, that would have been -- had a very negative impact.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine having gone into this year with every American thinking their taxes had been increased; 30 million Americans not knowing how to file an alternative minimum tax -- you take that to entire country seeing this President working together to not only extend the tax cuts, to do a new payroll tax cut, to a new business incentive.\xc2\xa0 I think people can talk about tone, but results matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think what people have seen is they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President really leading to bring people together to get things done.\xc2\xa0 And I think a lot of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing now, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Startup America, et cetera, have a lot of that sense.\xc2\xa0 They are the private sector working with us, with the administration, with labor, with the business community.\xc2\xa0 I think you take this -- this commercial building retrofits I think will be a great example where you will see labor and business working together on national goals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think -- yes, I think the relationship has -- feels stronger going forward, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s part of an overall feeling of increased confidence that people see the President willing and able to work together to help get some things done that matter on the economy and jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gene and Austan, I want to ask you a question on innovation.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern with this 112th Congress, that there could be cuts in funding for the green jobs programs?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how are you going to promote innovation with the green jobs, particularly in the minority sectors to get African Americans and Hispanics to get on board with the green jobs?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the discussion we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have as a country going forward.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward in the State of the Union and in his budget an economic strategy -- an economic strategy for accelerating jobs and investment now, but an economic strategy for winning the future, strengthening our competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 And a critical component of that is getting our fiscal house in order, reducing spending, and getting the deficit on a significant downward path.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We worked very hard to achieve that critical component of improving our fiscal path in a way that ensured we still could be making the investments that we think are critical for our country, competing for the high-wage jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0 It is a very tough budget; it will get tougher each year.\xc2\xa0 When you are freezing, it is a real cut, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a real cut that gets bigger each year.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re -- we felt that this was a degree of fiscal constraint that we could do, that was very difficult, but could still be consistent with a strategy for investing in innovation, education, and research.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether or not -- and people will be able to see all of the details of our budget on February 14th, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to debate and judge whether we drew the balance the right way.\xc2\xa0 We think we did.\xc2\xa0 I think as people have to look at other budgets that go out, where -- that share the same goal we do in reducing spending, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to look at the details and see whether those budgets also match the same commitment to making sure we\xe2\x80\x99re dong things that are pro-growth and pro-jobs for the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Austan was going --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to comment on the budget.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has made clear, though, that the green jobs area and the energy sector is a critical priority of investment, that that\xe2\x80\x99s part of -- a wide section of the innovation strategy is geared towards that environmental area.\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to chew up the seed corn and spit it out before it\xe2\x80\x99s planted, which would be cutting the investments for the future that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to grow, that\xe2\x80\x99s making a big mistake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think all sides agree that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to cut and be fiscally responsible.\xc2\xa0 The question is where do we do that, and the priorities cannot be to get away from clean energy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up on that.\xc2\xa0 What are you to the people who --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 I actually meant to say chew up the seed corn and spit it out before it was planted, but -- (laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gene, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come -- why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come to the podium --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He said that in 1997.\xc2\xa0 Weird.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was here then.\xc2\xa0 I was here with Gene.\xc2\xa0 Gene, let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about what people are saying with budget cutting right now at a time of recession?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.\xc2\xa0 You should be doing that when there is a recovery versus doing that now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Well, remember that when you look at our entire budget, yes, we are starting on the path of fiscal restraint and we are freezing non-security spending.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, that is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that that is -- calls for a degree of fiscal restraint there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we think that the confidence that that provides that we are on a path to cutting discretionary spending by $400 billion, getting down to a level, as a percentage of our economy, the lowest since Eisenhower, is a reasonable step forward that will not be harmful to the economy when you look that it is coming in combination with a $112 billion payroll tax cut, in combination with the 100 percent expensing, which actually accelerates over $100 billion of tax relief in 2011 for business investment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it has the right combination.\xc2\xa0 As we said, it\xe2\x80\x99s an overall strategy.\xc2\xa0 You have to look how it works together.\xc2\xa0 This does start -- it starts the process of restraint, but not to such a deep degree that it would hurt job growth.\xc2\xa0 And that happens in combination with the measures that the President passed in December that have a very high bang for the buck in terms of investment and job growth in 2011.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Laura.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let these guys get back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit about discretionary spending and of the need for fiscal restraint.\xc2\xa0 Of course, discretionary spending is a small part of the overall budget; entitlements are a big part.\xc2\xa0 The President to date has not picked up the -- his own fiscal commission\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations on entitlements, and in fact, in the State of the Union, on Social Security, seemed to go the other way.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk specifically on Social Security and in general on entitlements, what the thinking is at the White House right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, first of all, the President, through the American Care Act, has made a very significant dent in lowering health care spending, particularly in the second decade, but as you saw, when those -- when people sought to repeal his health care reform act, that was going to increase the deficit by $250 billion.\xc2\xa0 So there are a lot of savings and efficiencies and lowering the cost of health care growth in what he has passed so far.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see our own budget.\xc2\xa0 There will be some additional steps there for -- to see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did make very clear when he was in the State of the Union that as tough as his spending restraint is, he acknowledged that\'s only one slice of the budget; that anything else we had to do as a country would have to be both parties and both houses working together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I will say one thing that I think is important on Social Security, which is, this is not about short-term deficits.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about using this as a mechanism to a lower deficit path.\xc2\xa0 The reason why the President is open to bipartisan measures on Social Security solvency is because he believes that Social Security is a sacred trust, that it has been the hallmark of increased dignity for people in retirement for past generations, and he wants it to be for future generations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when we look at Social Security, we will be looking at it through one measure, and that is to ensure that what has really been a crown jewel of policy in the United States for providing dignified retirement for older Americans continues to exist in a way that is strong, protects the vulnerable, those with disabilities and is not subject to the whims of the market, and is the one thing that people can count on in good times and bad times in their retirement.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our sole goal for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So while that may be in other people\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal plans for us, it is very much about trying to reform and strengthen something he thinks is very, very important to the economic dignity of seniors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about whether to actually tackle that anytime soon?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say our current thinking is the budget will be released on the 14th.\xc2\xa0 All right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us more about the patent reforms for --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Patent reform?\xc2\xa0 Uh oh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 Well, the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He bet me nobody would ask about this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 It will need -- you told me no one would.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I am very glad you asked the question.\xc2\xa0 Look, it is not just their -- the strategy goes through -- and if you want to go through in some more detail -- but it cannot just be done purely by executive action.\xc2\xa0 It will take some legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the key is to, on two tracks, let the patent office make the investments they need to get the backlogs down and speed up their process.\xc2\xa0 And the second is the fast-track patenting, which enables essentially a faster track; that people can make higher payments of their fees to get on a track of patents that allow them to get a decision very rapidly if they believe that their invention is timing sensitive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s it cost?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost anything if you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said it would require some investments --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 It requires legislation.\xc2\xa0 It requires legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And investments to fast-track reforms?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 The patent -- I mean, do we want to go into -- the patent system -- there are fees to the patent system.\xc2\xa0 So for example, to fast-track patents, you would get more --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d charge more for --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 -- you would get faster because you would have a different fee.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a different track.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s worked through in the report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not more government money -- more money for the person wanting the patent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 Well, in these there are different approaches, obviously, for the different parts. One is you want the examiners and the system that they have of examining the patents now is perceived by almost everybody to be excessively bureaucratic.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to streamline that system just to get the processing times down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a hazing joke?\xc2\xa0 Why are you guys laughing?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the guy behind you that is making faces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will bet you a thousand dollars that Chuck is not in danger of doing a patent story in the next --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 Okay, Aneesh Chopra, the chief technology officer -- I want to give him a shout out --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a challenge?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GOOLSBEE:\xc2\xa0 But you can contact Aneesh Chopra or me and we would love to talk to you -- love to talk to you about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me know if you get that on --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you actually pay him $1,000?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me know if you get that in the news.\xc2\xa0 I will.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A challenge --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got about half an hour or so before --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s use it all up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s -- why not?\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s more patent questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about one and one --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll do one and one for you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One, and then we get more questions with the President, what do you say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already exceeded one and one.\xc2\xa0 Take us away.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Egypt, what\xe2\x80\x99s the administration conveying today to President Mubarak and the Egyptian government?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to what he\xe2\x80\x99s seen on the streets there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, I think that the message that has been delivered, again, through our embassy and through all levels of our engagement with the Egyptian government, first and foremost, continued restraint and the ability for protesters in Cairo to protest peacefully.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say -- and I talked to the President about this, this morning -- we continue to receive very disturbing reports about what you could only say is very systematic targeting of journalists, particularly international journalists.\xc2\xa0 I have dealt with our embassy on trying to get assistance for journalists to get out of the country, some of whom have been held, many of whom have been beaten.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I said this yesterday, and I will reiterate this again today:\xc2\xa0 That type of activity is deplorable.\xc2\xa0 If journalists are being held, they must be released immediately.\xc2\xa0 The world watches the actions of all of those in Egypt, and they speak volumes about the seriousness with which the government looks at an orderly transition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are heartened that I think what many thought might come to pass broadly today, at least when I walked out here, had not happened.\xc2\xa0 Our main message besides restraint and nonviolence, Jim, is that as the President said a few days ago, the government of Egypt must undertake, through negotiations with a broad base of those not currently in the government, direct negotiations to -- toward an orderly transition that gets us to free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have to be real -- that has to be real.\xc2\xa0 They have to be legitimate.\xc2\xa0 They need to take some concrete steps for this process to happen.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is clear that without those concrete steps and without those direct negotiations toward that transition, you are simply going to see -- continue to see more uncertainty and more unrest.\xc2\xa0 And I think --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does a concrete step include Mubarak stepping aside and maybe Suleiman or some other caretaker stepping in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we have said from the very beginning of this, these are solutions that can and will only be determined by the Egyptian people in solving the problems that we see today in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that continues -- that continues to be true.\xc2\xa0 The message for President Mubarak, Vice President Suleiman and others, again, has to be the need to take quick, concrete steps towards that transition.\xc2\xa0 I think the world is waiting to see that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you presenting those options to the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is -- these are -- this is not for us to determine, Jim.\xc2\xa0 This is the addressing of individual rights and the freedoms that so many in Egypt feel they lack can only be addressed by the government of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be provided by our government.\xc2\xa0 They have to be addressed and provided by their government.\xc2\xa0 And I think instability will continue until that\xe2\x80\x99s done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the White House concerned that there would be a power vacuum if President Mubarak stepped down now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said a minute ago, Jeff, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think there is the likelihood of greater instability and uncertainty without the government taking those concrete steps toward real change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the question.\xc2\xa0 The question is if he steps down now, are you concerned about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no -- let me -- I want to be clear, Jeff, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t answering your question because I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re likely -- what we are likely to see and the reason why we continue to watch the television of protesters today and we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to see that into the days of the future is not because the government is moving too quickly towards a transition.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the opposite, because the government has not done enough in a concrete way, with a broad enough base of a coalition of people that are outside of what constitutes the current government -- that signal has not come.\xc2\xa0 And unless or until that happens, instability is actually going to increase.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you respond, then, to Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to step down but he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid if he does --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there are concrete actions that he can take and that the Vice President can take toward moving in the path of real change that can lessen instability and can ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t descend into the chaos that he describes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think -- just as I outlined, I think it is -- the government, the Vice President and the President, need to sit down with a coalition that constitutes a broad cross-section of Egyptian society, of civil society, of opposition political groups -- people that are in Egypt and not represented in their government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a series of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re not to prescribe to the Egyptians that must take place along that pathway toward free and fair elections.\xc2\xa0 And unless or until that happens, my guess is the people that you see on TV aren\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.\xc2\xa0 I think that in order to see the transition happen in an orderly way, the people need to see some concrete steps.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are U.S. allies involved in that discussion, Robert?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this is a discussion that is being assisted by allies in and -- around the world, both in the region and outside the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, for days now you have been saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to decide, it\xe2\x80\x99s for the Egyptian people to decide.\xc2\xa0 You just said we\xe2\x80\x99re not prescribing anything to the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 So what is going on then behind the scenes?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are all these high-level meetings, back-and-forth of equals.\xc2\xa0 If you weren\xe2\x80\x99t offering suggestions or options, then what are you doing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- Dan, I just outlined a series of steps right here in public that I think the government can and should take to address that very instability and that very uncertainty.\xc2\xa0 And I said I think on the very first day of this crisis, my guess is that this will be said at this podium for months to come.\xc2\xa0 These are -- this is not a solution that can be imposed on or that can be forced on anybody in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, it is not -- I doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody in Cairo that is looking for my definition of their freedom of speech.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be determined here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be determined in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re marching there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But look, it is safe to assume that this country has for the past several decades had a very important relationship with the government and the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 The Camp David Accords signed by Egypt and adhered to by Egypt have provided a cornerstone for regional security for more than three decades.\xc2\xa0 We have a vested interest in the foreign policy in Egypt and throughout the region as it relates to our national interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as I said a few days ago, there are meetings here about a whole range of issues and a whole range of scenarios.\xc2\xa0 And I was in one of those meetings at 8:30 a.m. this morning.\xc2\xa0 Those meetings will continue with the President over the weekend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much intelligence did the White House have about this kind of unrest potentially happening?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have seen and I think White Houses and administrations here for many years have seen intelligence about the instability in countries in the Middle East and throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 I think the question that you\xe2\x80\x99re alluding to, Dan, is, did we -- did somebody foreshadow the specific events in Tunisia?\xc2\xa0 And as we recall, a fruit vendor in Tunisia had his fruit stolen and lit himself on fire, and that started in Tunisia a series of events that have greatly impacted that country.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody expects that we would have gotten a report in December that might have predicted a particular fruit vendor doing something like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as things transpired in Tunisia, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in this room before, we saw -- I read intelligence that talked about what the result might be in countries throughout the region because, as the President has said throughout this, governments must be responsible to the people that they represent.\xc2\xa0 And when they\xe2\x80\x99re not, you have uncertainty and unrest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there was no intelligence that predicted this kind of unrest, not necessarily how or what the trigger mechanism would be, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear, I did not say that.\xc2\xa0 I said, was there specific intelligence about the specific incident that started in Tunisia?\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asking that, not the specific incident that started it --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but what the result could be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think some reporting has intimated that somehow that there was some intelligence failure that that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.\xc2\xa0 Rest assured that there are volumes of reports that have been read by this administration and past administrations about the potential for instability and unrest in Tunisia, in Egypt and throughout the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understand the -- I think some of the passion that you see in Cairo is not because -- not necessarily because people have felt as if their government hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully represented their views and respected their individual rights in 2011.\xc2\xa0 I think this is something that goes back quite some time, which is why administrations that predated ours have brought up with President Mubarak the steps that they believe needed to take place just as President Obama brought up with President Mubarak the steps that we felt needed to take place to address the lack of freedoms that we knew they weren\xe2\x80\x99t adhering to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President satisfied with the level of intelligence that he received on Tunisia and Egypt?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President expects that in any case, that he will be provided with relevant, timely and accurate intelligence assessments, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s been done throughout this crisis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the orderly transition that the government has called for, that you guys have called for, on Wednesday you were quite direct by saying "now" means yesterday, meaning Tuesday when President Obama first called for that.\xc2\xa0 Three days have gone by since.\xc2\xa0 Days do matter in this instance.\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied with the change that has taken place on Cairo\xe2\x80\x99s side?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we are and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- it appears, based on the pictures I\'ve seen on television today, neither are the people in Cairo or throughout Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, when we talk about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see unrest or whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see stability, we are, until or unless some real change is made and some progress -- people can see and feel progress on that path toward free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, days matter.\xc2\xa0 So how soon would you like to see that tangible change?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- President Mubarak said we needed that transition.\xc2\xa0 President Obama agreed that that transition needed to happen and that the time for that was now.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s readily apparent that those in Cairo, those in Egypt, need to see this process happen and they need to see this process begin.\xc2\xa0 And it needs to begin in a real and concrete and legitimate way.\xc2\xa0 It cannot be for show.\xc2\xa0 It has to include -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned, it has to include that broad section of people, many of whom we see protesting for their rights in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And about the back-and-forth going on between the different -- about the orderly transition, do you believe that a transitional government headed by the Egyptian Vice President would satisfy the demands of the protesters in the street?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that I\xe2\x80\x99m in any position to say what exact steps would satisfy those in Cairo marching because they don\'t feel as if they\xe2\x80\x99ve been heard or respected in terms of their individual rights.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- as I said earlier, I think the instability continues without anybody in Cairo seeing those concrete steps begin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just mentioned the kinds of meetings discussing various scenarios that are going on around here.\xc2\xa0 Is this government still in contact with the government in Cairo, with the military in Cairo, is discussing those kinds of scenarios and possibilities?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that I don\'t have a call -- I don\'t know that -- when I came out, I don\'t believe the President had spoken with anybody in the Egyptian government today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But have other members of this government spoken to people in the Egyptian government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 I know that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they continue to do so?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 There\'s important contact, first and foremost, at the embassy with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they discussing these scenarios for Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s departure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of each and every one of those calls.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s, again, embassy-to-MFA contact.\xc2\xa0 There\'s Pentagon-to-military contact, the important mil-to-mil relationships that I think have helped in the exercise of restraint that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past couple days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, Bill, safe to say that a whole host of conversations are being had.\xc2\xa0 And the main message in each and every one of those conversations is, as I said a minute ago, which are that the government must take concrete steps.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to provide each and every step that needs to take place.\xc2\xa0 That\'s for the government of Egypt to understand through dialogue and through negotiation with that broad cross-section of people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But aren\xe2\x80\x99t they in kind of a bind because the people in the street aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to accept or talk to a new government until Mubarak is gone?\xc2\xa0 But for Mubarak to form a new government, he has to take an active part I think under Egyptian law.\xc2\xa0 So they\'re at an impasse.\xc2\xa0 What can the U.S. do to help that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the biggest role -- the most important and biggest role that we can play is encouraging the government of Egypt to become involved in those negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that for five days, and you keep saying, it\xe2\x80\x99s yesterday, yesterday -- Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 We got nothing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, Bill, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and what do we see every day?\xc2\xa0 More and more people come out.\xc2\xa0 More and more reporters that are beaten.\xc2\xa0 This is not going to be solved here.\xc2\xa0 It is going to be solved by the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\'t begin to take those steps, you\'re not going to see a relief in the instability that we\xe2\x80\x99ve watched.\xc2\xa0 And I think --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my question then is how hard is the U.S. pushing?\xc2\xa0 I mean we\xe2\x80\x99ve got $1.5 billion on the line here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have more than $1.5 billion on the line.\xc2\xa0 We have important relationships and a very important national interest in stability and order in the country and in the region.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that every call begins with two things -- a call for restraint and a call for concrete direct negotiations so that the people can see the government is willing and able and actively making changes that will lead to free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we making specific proposals about how those negotiations, those exchanges, can take place?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have been broad, but we have -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody expects that we are going to outline each and everything that has to happen.\xc2\xa0 Again, I feel confident in saying that the biggest step that we can push for is for the government to begin that negotiation and begin it with a representative and broad cross-section of the people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the opposition, which apparently says it does not want to talk to the government until Mubarak steps down?\xc2\xa0 Are we pushing them to begin talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- absolutely.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But it -- I think what we have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically to drop that demand?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- I have not heard that.\xc2\xa0 I think what -- again, I think the greatest impediment to making this progress is beginning the process, and beginning the process at a level where the government is taking seriously the involvement of some of the broad opposition groups that you speak about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the onus is all on the government now and not on the opposition?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the government begin to show concrete steps that it\xe2\x80\x99s willing to take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On intelligence, was there a failure of intelligence, a failure to heed, or neither?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would I guess direct you to what I said to Dan.\xc2\xa0 I think the President felt -- has felt as if he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten timely and accurate intelligence, and that, as I said, there are volumes of reports on instability throughout the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there was a report in late 2010 according to Stephanie O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan that specifically said Egypt was ripe for instability.\xc2\xa0 That was her testimony, yes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My guess is there\xe2\x80\x99s a report that dates back each and every year about instability in many of these countries.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you need a report from the intelligence community to let you know there\xe2\x80\x99s potential instability in Egypt or in the Middle East.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State Clinton says we\xe2\x80\x99re in uncharted territory here.\xc2\xa0 Are U.S.-Egyptian relations ever going to be the same?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have an important relationship, as I said earlier, with the country and with the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that whatever government comes next, we expect that we will again have the type of relationship that has provided, as I said, through the actions of the Egyptian government, a cornerstone for safety and security and regional stability in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 It is -- it has been an important relationship, and it will be in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has been important primarily because of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s peace treaty with Israel.\xc2\xa0 Does the new relationship have to be based on a much more democratic Egypt?\xc2\xa0 Can it be the same with an Egypt that does not fundamentally implement democratic reforms?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a solution I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to come at the ground on Egypt -- in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at something that is less than what we have now or -- lest we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the images that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.\xc2\xa0 And I know you alluded to the Camp David Accords.\xc2\xa0 Our expectation would be that whatever the next government of Egypt is, that they would adhere to treaties signed by the government of Egypt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, by expectation, does that mean we would use our -- if it took our influence via military aid that we give to make sure that they -- use whatever tools we had to make sure they abided by this peace treaty?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not presuppose through -- by me through here what tools we would use.\xc2\xa0 But again --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99d use tools.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a treaty -- this treaty is not with a particular president.\xc2\xa0 It is with the government, the country and the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We would expect that that treaty, just as if this government changed hands in an election, that you adhere to the treaties that previous presidents have signed and have been ratified in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you another variation of what Bill asked, which is, have we asked or suggested to Mubarak to transfer some power to the Vice President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into, again, conversations that are had in the Situation Room or between our President and other presidents.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Suleiman came out today and said no transfers would take place, and it was sort of an odd way that it was -- he announced this, implying that there was some suggestion that Mubarak should transfer some power.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wing it.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I\'m happy to look at some -- a particular quote on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. ElBaradei said today that he had spoken to the ambassador of the United States, the ambassador of Britain, the ambassador of Australia, the Prime Minister of Greece.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what kind of effort right now the United States is trying to do to get the international community involved.\xc2\xa0 And what does the President see the advantage of that being?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you just mentioned in many ways the broad arc of -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Europeans, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the greater Middle Eastern region -- the important equities that countries have and relationships that they have with Egypt, and the importance that they see in the same sort of regional and country stability that we hope for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that we are better served by a number of countries delivering the same message you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President deliver.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is important, again, as the world watches these images, that the world is involved in reiterating the message that we have sent and continue to send to the government of Egypt about the steps that they need to take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we -- is the United States right now trying to play an informal intermediary role right now between the government of Egypt and the opposition?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, I think Ambassador Scobey spoke with Mohamed ElBaradei, as she has and will with a host of civil society and political opposition groups throughout Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That is a robust expectation that our government and I think any U.S. government would have of their mission in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 So we are, and the embassy was, well before anything started in Cairo, maintains a relationship with many of those groups and with many in civil society.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nick.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the week since the President spoke and over the days that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been making statements as well, do you feel that any progress is being made in bringing the two sides together to end these protests, or is it still at the same spot it was a week ago when the President first came out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think we have -- I think we -- have we seen enough progress?\xc2\xa0 I think the answer to that clearly is no.\xc2\xa0 I think very -- as we sit here a week later, and as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here before, we have watched events happen in a country we have not seen in -- in a country with a very rich history that we have not seen over the course of many thousand years.\xc2\xa0 What we are seeing is not something that happens every couple of years in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 These are remarkable times.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think in one sense we have undoubtedly seen, from where we sit right now, a week since both President Mubarak and President Obama first spoke, both on the phone and publicly making statements, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen change from Friday to Tuesday in acknowledgement of President Mubarak not seeking reelection.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is clear that we still see those in the street looking for the type of concrete transition that both men spoke about just a few days ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the situation on the street better now or worse?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we are heartened -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll split the question into two.\xc2\xa0 I think we are heartened by two things.\xc2\xa0 One, that we have broadly seen restraint, as we deplore the scenes and the stories that -- as I mentioned earlier of diplomats, human rights groups and journalists -- so I think that is heartening.\xc2\xa0 And as I said yesterday, we take what the Prime Minister said yesterday -- we take seriously and hope that the government of Egypt takes seriously the words of the Prime Minister in saying that those responsible for the violence on Wednesday will and should be held accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who are the individuals that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 You split it and I don\'t think you put it back together.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it better or worse?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned these two things that are --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s better because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen -- I think, again, many of us -- I think many of us thought as night fell in Cairo last Friday that we were unsure what we\xe2\x80\x99d wake up on Saturday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So from the perspective of the type of broad violence that you certainly hoped wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, again, we have -- we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly glad about that.\xc2\xa0 And I think the same went for the events of today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, today was -- there were a lot of people out, and we were -- as we have been -- concerned about what that would mean.\xc2\xa0 So I think we have seen some hopeful signs as it relates to restraint.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think the type of political change that many have talked about, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything about an assassination attempt on Vice President Suleiman a couple days ago?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess that\'s a yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can we change the subject?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any further reaction to the job numbers today in terms of what it expects going forward, given the problems with today\xe2\x80\x99s number?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you heard Austan and Gene -- and I should be careful because Austan is actually a trained economist and I just play one in here.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I think -- as he talked about, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two different surveys.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a survey that calls up a house and says, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you have a job?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That is a survey that -- ultimately you derive from that survey the unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 Then there\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s known as the establishment survey that calls a business and says, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s at work, what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, are you hiring?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that goes into a BLS payroll number.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve -- and we have talked about in here and I\'ve watched the commentary and listened to it and read more about, you obviously have some very divergent survey data.\xc2\xa0 You have undoubtedly some weather impact in the establishment survey, particularly in industries like construction and transportation, where one might easily presume that weather would affect the numbers coming out of that survey.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that we -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we would ever look at -- through a series of data that we see over a week or a month and hang any of our hat on one particular number either way.\xc2\xa0 I think we are encouraged in the sense that we see continued progress, private sector hiring.\xc2\xa0 That progress in the President\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint, though, continues not at the pace that we would like to see it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Austan said, I think we will learn more about what this report means in the coming months as we look through some of the numbers underneath what do the construction numbers mean, what do the transportation numbers mean, what do the overall workforce numbers mean.\xc2\xa0 Again, the bottom line for us, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more to be done to put 8 million people unemployed as a result of the financial calamity back to work.\xc2\xa0 That work would have continued, though, regardless of what the numbers today showed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Goyal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question, one.\xc2\xa0 Is President aware of, Robert, that U.S. diplomat is still held in Pakistan, and Pakistanis are very angry at the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, U.S. diplomat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 U.S. diplomat is still being held by the Pakistanis, Pakistani courts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I would direct you to either the Pakistani government or our embassy in Islamabad on that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is aware of a lot of things, Goyal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Glenn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there was a report today that the President expressed \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointment\xe2\x80\x9d to DNI Clapper over the level of intelligence and analysis he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate or inaccurate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I answered broadly about the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on intelligence that he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten.\xc2\xa0 I also think it is largely safe to assume that I am not going to get into conversations that may or may not have happened in the President\xe2\x80\x99s daily briefing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other.\xc2\xa0 Just in general, are we supporting these protesters in Cairo?\xc2\xa0 How would you sort of characterize that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I did the first day of this.\xc2\xa0 We support the aspirations of those in Cairo, in Alexandria, in countries throughout the world to see governments respect their basic rights:\xc2\xa0 the right to assemble, the right to speak freely, the right to associate.\xc2\xa0 In this instance, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the rights to freely communicate over the Internet through social networking tools cut off.\xc2\xa0 And our government, as it has in this instance and as it will in countries throughout the world, supports those aspirations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President sees these images, these very moving images in the square there, have you seen his reaction?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how does he actually react when he sees these people holding a person in a wheelchair over their heads?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that, as the President has said, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re watching -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re watching what happens when people in a country do not believe their government fully appreciates the rights that they lack.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the case, again, not just in Egypt, but as the President has had discussions with leaders throughout the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who are the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert -- no, excuse me, he called on me.\xc2\xa0 Robert --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We got to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but can I get my question out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I got only a couple of minutes and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do this quickly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll play rapid fire.\xc2\xa0 Go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, sure.\xc2\xa0 Rahm Emanuel -- what is the President doing for him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made calls?\xc2\xa0 Sources in Chicago are saying he\xe2\x80\x99s made personal calls for Rahm, on behalf of Rahm.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any guidance on that.\xc2\xa0 I think Rahm is still shoveling the President\xe2\x80\x99s sidewalk.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Savannah.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned that the U.S. supports the demonstrators.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Cairo --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said -- no, no, let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 I said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the democratic aspirations of the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Got you -- listening comprehension.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed to the comments --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 B-minus.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed to the comments of the President in Cairo, supporting democracy in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 But in 2009 the administration, this administration, actually, cut funding to democracy groups and civil society groups in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 So how do you square the words with the action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we are -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see in the budget that the President releases, we are not going to -- on a whole host of things that are important to him, that are important to the other political party, that are going to have to be reduced as a result of 10 or 12 years of spending well beyond our means.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think the notion somehow that our -- the support of the aspirations of those that seek greater freedoms is only supported by a level of funding in your budget, I think is -- don\'t necessarily match up, particularly at a time in which you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see reductions in a whole host of programs that are important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think cutting the funding had any effect on the pace of reform, for example?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- my guess is we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- there have been a number of expenditures over the past 30 years to support groups with similar causes in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re just now seeing the manifestation of the cares and concerns of those involved.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Stephen, and then I\'ll come back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today the Supreme Leader of Iran made his first intervention in Friday prayers for seven months, saying that this was an uprising against -- in Egypt against an ally of Israel, the United States.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?\xc2\xa0 And the longer this goes on, are you concerned that foes of the United States could try and whip up extremist allies in this power vacuum there is at the moment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable that Iran would make a statement in -- given the -- given their actions when it came to their people exercising the same rights that people are exercising now in Cairo.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the world, Stephen, would welcome the acknowledgment from the Islamic Republic of Iran, if they\xe2\x80\x99re so inclined, to allow their people to exercise the same rights that you see in Cairo peacefully.\xc2\xa0 I think that would represent some real progress across the Middle East, and I think the world would challenge them to have their words match their actions, which we recall, based on the violence that we saw in 2009, they\xe2\x80\x99re not good at living up to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe the United States still has leverage with the government of Mubarak?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us why U.S. assistance shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used now to get him to heed your calls for immediate transition?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me do this quickly because I do have to -- you guys have to get to a press conference as well, I\'m told.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI do think we can -- look, we continue to speak, as I said, at a full range of levels to the Egyptian government, and I do think that the -- I do think the conversations that many have had with the military have been helpful.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the actions that we will see from the top of the Egyptian government have to be in response to the -- have to be solved by and have to be in response to what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the ground in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can impose that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of our assistance -- and then I\'m going to run -- as I said I think about a week ago, we will continue to watch the actions of the Egyptian government and evaluate what those actions might mean.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, we are heartened to see restraint.\xc2\xa0 We deplore the images and the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen for human rights groups, and that have impacted particularly international journalists, and call again on the government of Egypt to take some concrete steps toward direct negotiations that will bring about the type of change that we need to see on a path towards an orderly transition and free and fair elections.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President make a statement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President will make a statement shortly, which is -- I will see you there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:56 P.M.
