EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is going to be a quick one.\xc2\xa0 If you guys will -- because we\'re obviously going to land and the President is speaking at the event.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming with us today to North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 We\'re looking forward to the visit to Cree, which is an advanced lighting manufacturer that\'s doing some very good work in the clean energy and efficiency field.\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously there for a meeting of his Jobs and Competitiveness Council and he looks forward to hearing from them their ideas for spurring further job creation in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk about Syria a little bit?\xc2\xa0 Assad has mounted a violent attack against his own people.\xc2\xa0 Why is that any different than what Libya did and what prompted NATO to act?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, there was a united call for action in Libya.\xc2\xa0 These are -- let me step back.\xc2\xa0 There are different circumstances.\xc2\xa0 We have called on President Assad to cease the violence.\xc2\xa0 We strongly condemn -- in the strongest possible terms, we condemn the violence being perpetrated against Syrians and we -- as we have in other places -- call on the leadership there to engage in non-violence and to engage in political dialogue so that the Syrian people can fully participate in their government and improve their own futures.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously the actions we took -- as you know, we had a United Nations mandate.\xc2\xa0 We had a broad coalition that was eager to participate in a mission that was designed to prevent the immediate carnage that would have taken place in Benghazi, to protect civilians from the grave danger presented by Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces, to enforce an arms embargo and to enforce a no-fly zone.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President tried to energize or create a similar support in the region to take action against Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that President Assad needs to engage in political dialogue, that the transition there needs to take place towards more political freedom, and that if President Assad does not lead that transition then he should step aside.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, quickly on the thing today -- the President is going to listen or is he actually going to make some announcement on additional steps to boost jobs?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will also have some things to say.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll make remarks, which you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have announcements, which I won\xe2\x80\x99t preempt here, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll have some things that he -- some ideas of his own.\xc2\xa0 But he created this council specifically to hear from a broad array of major private sector players, their ideas for increasing job creation here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President have a position on whether Anthony Weiner\xe2\x80\x99s continued service in the U.S. Congress is in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s best interests?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President feels -- we feel at the White House that this is a distraction.\xc2\xa0 Obviously as Congressman Weiner has said himself, this is -- the behavior was inappropriate; the dishonesty was inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 But the President is focused on his job, which is getting this economy continuing to grow, creating jobs, and obviously ensuring the safety and security of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of the criticism from the business community as the President has held these sorts of events like the one today is there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really been much follow-up afterwards.\xc2\xa0 Immelt and Chenault released a series of recommendations in the Wall Street Journal op-ed today that said could create a million jobs. How can the President now -- what are the next steps the President can take to follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is -- I mean, this is the council that he created and the President is very eager to hear these ideas.\xc2\xa0 He is looking for ideas from every quarter to continue on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- that greater than 2.1 million private sector jobs have been created in the last 15 months.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously taken a number of significant steps, including 17 small business tax cuts, including obviously the provisions that he fought hard for within the tax cut deal with the Congress last December, that he thinks has been very important to ensuring that we continue private sector job growth and economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he think it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the private sector now to step up more than the public sector is able?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is -- he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously got an agenda that includes extending and expanding the R&amp;D tax credit, that includes getting free trade agreements through Congress so that they can create jobs here in America, and obviously ensuring that we get a significant deficit reduction deal that gives the confidence -- gives confidence to people around the country and the world that we are getting our fiscal house in order, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to arrest the kind of economic growth and development that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last 17 -- 15 months.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did any of the President\xe2\x80\x99s top aides have any role in engineering or encouraging Anthony Weiner to resign or to step aside?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is an issue that the Congress has been addressing, congressional leaders have been addressing, and that Congressman Weiner has been addressing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did any of his top aides have conversations --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that Anthony Weiner should resign?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I answered that question.\xc2\xa0 We think this is a distraction obviously from the important business that this President needs to conduct and Congress needs to conduct.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more comment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the economy, does the President regret using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbump in the road\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s taken some hits from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Was that an appropriate use of that phrase?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 "Bump in the road" is exactly what the President said, that this is not -- when you are emerging from the worst recession since the Great Depression, 8 million jobs lost because of the recession that he inherited when he took office, what he has said is that as we emerge from this recession, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a straight road, there may be some bumps on the road.\xc2\xa0 These are common phrases in the English lexicon.\xc2\xa0 And I think that his meaning is clear, which is that we are headed in the right direction, but it is not necessarily a smooth path.\xc2\xa0 And that is precisely because of the devastating impact that the recession he inherited has had on -- or did have on the American economy and on unemployment in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, he has overseen in the last 15 months the creation of 2.1 million private sector jobs and seven straight quarters of economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think extending the payroll tax cut so that it affects employers as well as employees, would that benefit the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are open to ideas.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re eager to get input from Republicans and Democrats and others in this process.\xc2\xa0 The President is very focused on the initiatives that I just mentioned, on hearing the ideas that his Jobs and Competitiveness Council will have, and obviously on ensuring that the deficit reduction talks led by the Vice President bear fruit so that we can demonstrate to the American people that we can cut spending, reduce our deficit, and do it in a way that ensures that we continue to grow and create jobs in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, The New York Times had a story today about these Internet suit cases that are being used by the administration in places that countries are blocking the Net.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about that report?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us about that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can simply say that obviously we, as the President laid out in his cyberspace strategy, oppose countries who block access to the Internet and block access to information.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that we -- in terms of how funding and things like that for some of the efforts we have underway in our programs that are very quite transparent, I think you can talk to the State Department on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 11:02 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
