Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:07 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re all feeling \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bern.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I do not have any opening statements to make at the top, other than a corny joke.\xc2\xa0 So we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tDarlene, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great, thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up a little bit on a meeting the President had yesterday on the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the Zika virus is similar -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s approaching the spread of the Zika virus similar to the way he approached the spread of Ebola in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 I mean, does he kind of see the U.S. leading some sort of anti-Zika virus effort?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty significant difference -- a number of significant differences between the Ebola virus and the Zika virus, obviously both in terms of the way they are transmitted, but also in terms of the health impacts.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Ebola is a deadly disease.\xc2\xa0 The Zika virus poses a different set of risks that are most serious for pregnant women.\xc2\xa0 And that explains the kind of reaction you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the federal government and the kind of guidance that the CDC has shared with Americans who are considering travel to tropical areas -- to a variety of tropical areas in the Western Hemisphere.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President has spoken at some length about the lessons that we can draw from fighting Ebola, that the value of having a critical health infrastructure in place is critical to positive public health outcomes.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about the unique role that the United States can play in mobilizing an international response to diseases like this that do pose a broader public health risk.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly mindful of all of that as we consider the risk that is posed by the Zika virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tMost of our efforts right now, however, are focused on sharing information with the public about steps that they can take to protect themselves.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is a risk that is most acute for pregnant women, or women who are planning to become pregnant.\xc2\xa0 For people who are not pregnant, men and women, the Zika virus is basically a mild, non-fatal form of Dengue fever.\xc2\xa0 And the most common symptoms are things like a mild fever, a rash, or conjunctivitis.\xc2\xa0 That said, studies show that only about one in five people who get Zika will have any symptoms.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we are primarily concerned about is the link that is apparent between a particular birth defect in women who have contracted the Zika virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I would anticipate in the days ahead that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more of a conspicuous, concerted effort on the part of the U.S. government to communicate with the American people about the risks of this virus and the steps that they can take to protect themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the statement that you all released last night after the meeting said the President emphasized the need to accelerate research to make available better diagnostic tests, vaccine development, and again, public information.\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate the President asking for any additional money to do any of the things that were just cited here, for research or vaccine development?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no specific request that I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to make from here today.\xc2\xa0 But mobilizing the kind of response that may be necessary certainly could require additional funding, but I would also expect that the kind of funding that we would envision would at least in part be useful in building up the broader public health infrastructure that would have benefits in fighting a variety of diseases.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then to switch over to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bern\xe2\x80\x9d -- (laughter) -- did you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You guys laugh when she says it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I get groans when I say it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you have a chance to hear any of what the Senator said outside after the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He seemed very complimentary towards the President, almost embracing the President.\xc2\xa0 Was there any early feedback from the President on how he thought the meeting went?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the meeting had just ended before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 I did not speak to the President about the meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, the two men spent about 45 minutes together.\xc2\xa0 It was, as Senator Sanders said, a one-on-one meeting.\xc2\xa0 And the President was certainly expecting to spend some time talking in the meeting about how they could work together to advance Democratic priorities and values.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s work that they\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously done in the past, and that\xe2\x80\x99s work that the President hopes they can do together in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, Senator Sanders, as he noted to all of you, is a part of a very active campaign right now, and he\xe2\x80\x99s spending a lot of time on the campaign trail and clearly is enjoying the kind of response that he\xe2\x80\x99s getting from large crowds all across the country -- not just in Iowa, but in other places, including Minnesota.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, when the President spent some time on the campaign trail, he had the experience of drawing some big crowds and he enjoyed that experience.\xc2\xa0 And I think there was -- I would anticipate there was an opportunity for the President to reminisce a little bit about his own experience campaigning for President, both in terms of drawing big crowds but also spending some time talking to people in more out-of-the-way places where the crowds are not as large but the interactions do allow for a more personal, private conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President, even as he has served in office, has talked about how those kinds of opportunities are fewer and farther between when you\xe2\x80\x99re President of the United States; that you do sort of live in a bubble. \xc2\xa0And the President is constantly looking for creative ways to get out of it.\xc2\xa0 And when you spend time on the campaign trail running for President, you\xe2\x80\x99re necessarily going to spend some time interacting with individuals one on one.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly enjoyed that opportunity as a candidate and has talked a lot about how he wishes he could do more of it as President.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about this -- and this is something that the President expected to talk about in the meeting and Senator Sanders alluded to this as well -- it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the Democratic Party for there to be such a robust debate going on about who should be our party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\xc2\xa0 That debate is good for our democracy, it\xe2\x80\x99s also good for the party.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of that debate, Senator Sanders has had great success in engaging and even inspiring a large segment of the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat ability to engage Democrats and excite them and inspire them will be critical to the success of Democrats up and down the ballot, whether Senator Sanders is a nominee or not.\xc2\xa0 And it underscores that while there is an important debate going on inside the Democratic Party, the real difference lies between Republicans who advocate for the kinds of economic policies that mostly benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and led us to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and Democrats who continue to believe that our government policies should be focused on expanding economic opportunity for everybody, especially those in the middle class and those who are working hard to get into the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of the debate, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing on the campaign trail now, but that is a debate that will really crystallize in the context of a general election later this year.\xc2\xa0 And while, as Senator Sanders noted, the President is doing his best to allow the candidates to make their own case in the Democratic Primary process, he expects to be very actively and personally engaged in the general election to support those candidates that actually are interested in building on the progress that this country has made in the seven years of his presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on the meeting with Bernie Sanders.\xc2\xa0 Who called for the meeting?\xc2\xa0 And then also, he has put a hold on the nominee to lead the FDA, saying that he has too close ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering, did that come up in the meeting?\xc2\xa0 Was that a plan to come up in the meeting?\xc2\xa0 Has the White House at all been trying to work with him to get him to lift that hold on your nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me go to your first question first.\xc2\xa0 The President and Senator Sanders had the opportunity to visit at the congressional holiday ball here at the White House last month.\xc2\xa0 And at the party, Senator Sanders noted to the President that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to have the opportunity to sit down for a more formal meeting.\xc2\xa0 And the President agreed that would be a good idea, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working to set up this making for more than a month now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the President has had a pretty busy schedule over the last couple weeks, and Senator Sanders has, too.\xc2\xa0 But this is a meeting that came together in the last week or two.\xc2\xa0 And the President was pleased to have the opportunity to sit down with Senator Sanders today.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t know whether or not the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to be the next leader of the FDA came up in the context of this meeting.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President and the administration have full confidence in the ability of our nominee to make the kinds of decisions that are in the best interest of the health and safety of the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President would not have nominated him to the job if he didn\'t think that he would be able to effectively look out for the interests of middle-class families in that role.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the Zika virus, are there any plans at this point to appoint a Zika czar or someone to kind of lead the effort?\xc2\xa0 And even though, yes, it is really primarily focused on pregnant women and the effects are focused on pregnant women, it still seems like it would be pretty serious if these mosquitoes that spread the virus do come to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a plan to respond, like if this really becomes -- starts spreading in the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in some of these other countries they\xe2\x80\x99ve just told women not to get pregnant.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t seem like that would fly in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So is there a plan in place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, our public health experts both at the CDC and the NIH are mindful of the risks that are associated with the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 And the President is himself concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he convened a meeting here at the White House yesterday to discuss it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we will do is we will rely on the best scientific advice that is available to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And first and foremost, that starts with warning people about any travel plans they may have where this virus has been detected; and making sure that people are educated about the risk that it poses.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the risk to pregnant women or women who could become pregnant is serious.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that if you\'re a man or you\'re not pregnant, that the impact of the virus is relatively mild.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo first of all, we want to make sure that people are properly educated about the risks of this virus, but also that we\'re taking the kinds of steps that are necessary to do as much as possible to try to fight this disease.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Darlene mentioned the readout noted a desire to sort of ramp up our efforts to look for a vaccine and other treatments.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that scientists tell us is that trying to limit the mosquito population is another way that we can fight this disease.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re certainly going to avail ourselves of all of the scientific knowledge that\'s been accumulated to make sure that we are trying to stay in front of this disease.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the mosquito population in the United States in January is not significant.\xc2\xa0 But we are mindful that as the thermometer heats up here, that we need to be mindful of this risk.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there a need for a czar, do you think?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point -- other than a catchy name like Zika Czar, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate the need for that kind of position at this point.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But we did find it useful in the fall of 2014 to have somebody with the skills of Ron Klain to come in and help organize the interagency efforts across the federal government to fight the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 It\'s too early at this stage to say whether or not that will be necessary when it comes to the Zika virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 So in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Politico last week, he called Secretary Clinton \xe2\x80\x9cidealistic, progressive, good, smart, tough, experienced.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Then he again called her \xe2\x80\x9cwicked smart\xe2\x80\x9d a second time.\xc2\xa0 So that sounded to many listeners like a pretty glowing endorsement of Clinton.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would encourage you to just take it at face value.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like that\'s what you might be doing.\xc2\xa0 The President had kind words for Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 She is someone who served the President ably.\xc2\xa0 In his Cabinet, as Secretary of State, she advanced the interests of the United States all around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President also had the opportunity to watch her up close as she campaigned for the presidency in 2007 and 2008, and he came away from that experience with a deep admiration for her skills as a political candidate.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made no secret of the fact that over the years of campaigning against one another and then working together in the administration, that the two have become genuine friends.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, the President has also been clear that at this point he does not plan to offer up a specific endorsement in the presidential race.\xc2\xa0 And he has made a point of both saying nice things about his friends in public.\xc2\xa0 He also, as many of you have observed, has also explained where there are maybe some differences.\xc2\xa0 And sort of depending on the news cycle, sometimes that\'s interpreted as a jab at his former friend, or a resounding secret endorsement of someone whom he has long admired.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what all this reflects is a desire on the part of the President to support Democratic candidates and to position Democrats to win the presidential election in November, regardless of who the nominee is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the same interview, he had a few kind words for Bernie Sanders, as well.\xc2\xa0 But at one point, though, it seemed like he was describing him as a \xe2\x80\x9cbright, shiny object,\xe2\x80\x9d which I guess you can interpret positively or negatively, depending.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has certainly been described as worse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, because it almost seemed like he was also referring to a point where he, himself, at one point had been described in the same way.\xc2\xa0 But anyway, he used that, and then at another point it seemed almost like he might be saying that you need to have more than one focus or you need to have more than one issue, as if he was saying that that was Sanders.\xc2\xa0 So by saying those things the way he did, but not officially endorsing someone, and the timing of this, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this essentially have the weight, the effect of being an endorsement of Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think it does.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President did have the opportunity to talk in that interview about how important it is that somebody like Senator Sanders has succeeded in inspiring tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Democrats all across the country to attend his campaign events, become engaged in his campaign, contribute to his campaign, and be a part of a broader effort to put another Democrat in the White House.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a really good thing for the party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President also happens to think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for the country because it will ensure that the next President, if that person is a Democrat, recognizes the need to build on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made so far and not go back to the policies that actually led to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And all the Democratic candidates have given voice to that kind of commitment and that kind of view of the challenge facing our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the ability of somebody like Senator Sanders to engage Democrats all across the country in that debate and in that fight is a good thing for the country and a good thing for the party.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously why what Senator Sanders has been doing over the last year or so is so important.\xc2\xa0 And I say that regardless of whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s the nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when the President said that, as President you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of focusing on one thing.\xc2\xa0 Was he saying that, at this point, Sanders has been seeming to focus on one thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was just making an observation that applies to all of the candidates.\xc2\xa0 It certainly applies to Senator Sanders, it also applies to Senator Clinton, that the kinds of skills that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need in a Commander-in-Chief is not just a passion about one issue -- although that passion is really important and is critical to the success of any sort of campaign, particularly a national, presidential campaign -- but you\xe2\x80\x99re also going to have to demonstrate an ability to handle lots of different things at the same time.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the American people will have an opportunity to evaluate the capacity of candidates in both parties to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the differences that Sanders and the President have, which are well known, did they come any closer in agreement on any of these?\xc2\xa0 What would you say the -- if there was a positive outcome to this meeting today, what do you think it was?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it was an important opportunity for the two men to sit down and sort of talk about their shared commitment to advancing the policies and priorities and values that they have in common.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot more of a detailed readout to share with you from a private meeting, but I think there is value in having those kinds of conversations, and I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s not the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on foreign policy, would you say that they see eye to eye?\xc2\xa0 Were there any areas you could discuss that they talked about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more detail about that aspect of their conversation to share.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Politico, Hillary Clinton seems to think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments were somewhat tantamount to an endorsement.\xc2\xa0 She said the President was arguing that she is \xe2\x80\x9cbest prepared to do all aspects of the job.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a correct interpretation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has not issued an endorsement in the race.\xc2\xa0 At this point, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan to.\xc2\xa0 I would expect that the President will vote in the Illinois primary.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll vote absentee.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ll announce in advance exactly who he chooses to support, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted if that changes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a few months ago, the President joked about the Republican debate, saying that if the candidates couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle some of the moderators, then how are they going to handle the Chinese or the Russians.\xc2\xa0 Given that, what does the President think of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision now to skip the next debate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I noted that a spokesperson for Fox News had a variation on that very statement.\xc2\xa0 So I guess imitation is the highest form of flattery, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s Fox News that\xe2\x80\x99s doing the imitating.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I think what is true is that -- since you brought up the Politico interview -- the President himself noted that he was not a big fan of participating in presidential debates, but he never backed out of a debate two days before it was scheduled to be held.\xc2\xa0 And I think that demonstrates his own commitment to the process, and making good on one\xe2\x80\x99s commitments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that over last several months that Mr. Trump has repeatedly chosen to kick reporters out of the room for asking tough questions.\xc2\xa0 It appears he\xe2\x80\x99s taking that approach to a new level by avoiding those questions entirely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does he think it says something about his temperament and his ability to do the job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that his Republican opponents think so.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately it will be up to the voters to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the Bernie Sanders-Hillary Clinton thing, but in a different way.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s met with -- the President has met with Hillary Clinton several times as a private citizen.\xc2\xa0 And he met with Bernie Sanders today.\xc2\xa0 Is there any room for him to meet with Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley?\xc2\xa0 Does he I guess pass the bar to have a meeting with him when it comes his poll numbers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re not examining poll numbers before deciding on presidential meetings.\xc2\xa0 I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out a future meeting between the President and Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it being talked about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any active discussion right now.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that if Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley makes a request like that, that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a way to find some time on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has it been (inaudible)?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of one.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right now, back on another subject, the Flint subject.\xc2\xa0 What is the expectation for the Governor, the Mayor, for all involved when it comes to the water issue in Flint, Michigan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What is our expectation for the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the most important thing is that the people of Flint are looking to their state and local leaders who are responsible for water safety in their community to step up to the plate and fix the problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the federal government is certainly committed to playing our important role in helping them succeed in that endeavor.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of ways for us to do that.\xc2\xa0 One is we obviously have the expertise of the EPA, who has recently announced ramped-up testing of the water in that community.\xc2\xa0 Late last week, the President announced that he was expediting $80 million in funding to the state of Michigan that could potentially be used to confront some of the issues that are facing Flint and their water system right now.\xc2\xa0 There is a federal official from the Department of Health and Human Services that is there on the ground coordinating the assistance that\'s being provided by the federal government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason it\xe2\x80\x99s an HHS official is that obviously there are significant public health consequences for the water quality in Flint right now.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that we have the expertise on the ground that\'s necessary to deal with it and to try to support the ongoing efforts of state and local officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This has been years in the making to get to this crescendo moment.\xc2\xa0 Why did it take this long?\xc2\xa0 And why is not viewed by many in this country as a crisis?\xc2\xa0 People are saying we want to get someone to come in and test the water.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to do this -- we\'re talking about not charging people for water.\xc2\xa0 People are saying out in the street -- you can hear it from those who live in Flint, you can hear it from people just in the black community trying to understand why has this not been placed in a higher priority than what we\'re seeing now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President has made clear that this is a priority.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is evident both from the tone of his remarks, but also based on the kind of efforts that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen mobilized on behalf of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that Mayor Weaver of Flint considers this to be a crisis.\xc2\xa0 I think she\xe2\x80\x99s acting like it is.\xc2\xa0 And you saw Governor Snyder dedicate the first 10 or 15 minutes of his State of the State address to discussing this issue.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an indication that he believes that this is a significant problem that needs immediate attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that\'s notable here is that the reason that many people attribute -- what many people attribute the problems with Flint\xe2\x80\x99s water supply to is this changeover from where the water was obtained; and that by getting the water from the Flint River, that raised some significant questions about how clean the water is and what sort of threat that poses to public health.\xc2\xa0 That\'s only a recent change that has been made.\xc2\xa0 I believe that was in the summer of 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there may be a variety of things that conspired to contribute to this problem, but I think what most scientists have concluded is that this all stems from a decision that was made only about a year and a half ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, the President has his My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper initiative and it deals with at-risk minority males, while there are many critics who are now saying, and doctors who are saying that there could be a lost generation in Flint, Michigan because of the effects of this contaminated water.\xc2\xa0 What is being done as relates to that in this White House in trying to catch that lost generation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that the potential -- I want to underscore \xe2\x80\x9cpotential\xe2\x80\x9d -- public health impact here is quite significant.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the federal official that is responsible for coordinating the efforts of the federal government is an expert in public health.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re mindful of those risks and certainly will be mobilizing the resources that are necessary to try to deal with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you have lead -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to doctors who say we\'ve seen the effects of lead like in kids who were diagnosed years ago.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like Freddy Gray, for instance, in Baltimore, he had been diagnosed with lead poisoning.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying \xe2\x80\x9cpotential\xe2\x80\x9d -- there is a reality that lead poisoning and other contaminants can really do damage to a person academically, physically.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t attempting to downplay the impact of lead poisoning.\xc2\xa0 I think it is unclear at this point exactly what the extent of it was in Flint, and that\'s what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to take a look at.\xc2\xa0 I\'m certainly not downplaying the significance of -- or the seriousness of something like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to ask you about the budget that\'s coming out in a couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And the White House today rolled out a program of school lunches.\xc2\xa0 But I wanted to ask, will the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget adhere to the spending caps that were just agreed to in the budget agreement in December?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll have a whole lot more detail about what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the budget when we roll it out here in a couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 So stay tuned for that.\xc2\xa0 Sorry I can\'t help with yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 On Flint, the Governor there has asked for -- specifically asked for medical care, long-term medical care for minors under 21.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s asked the federal government to help with that.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President thinks is a good idea, or something that you\'re working actively towards doing?\xc2\xa0 I gather there will be a formal proposal to Health and Human Services fairly soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll obviously take a close look at any requests that are made by state and local officials for assistance that the federal government can provide.\xc2\xa0 And again, the federal official on the ground in Flint that\xe2\x80\x99s coordinating the federal resources that are being brought to bear to this situation is a public health expert, so she would certainly be in a good position to evaluate the benefits of a request like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems like a very -- a somewhat unique request because of the unique nature of this particular crisis.\xc2\xa0 Essentially, federal health care coverage for minors under the age of 21 on a long-term basis, that seems like a very significant commitment that the government would have to make, the federal government to make.\xc2\xa0 Conceptually, is that something the President, you think, would support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d have to take a look at exactly what the request is before rendering a judgment on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a pretty stinging editorial in the Detroit News about the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s role in all this.\xc2\xa0 Are you familiar with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the editorial, but go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The basic point of it is that the EPA knew that there was a problem about a year ago, but chose not to be very public about it, chose to deal with this more discreetly through the Michigan State Department of Environmental Protection.\xc2\xa0 But the critics in the agency are saying essentially they knew that there was a problem a year ago or more but really didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound the alarm.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair criticism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is that there is an ongoing Department of Justice investigation to this, so I have to be limited, at least measured in what I can say about it, because I don\'t want to be perceived as weighing in on this investigation or trying to defend or deflect blame from anybody.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just say, in general, that what the President himself has identified is the need to take another look at the relationship between the EPA and those states like Michigan where it is state and local officials who are responsible for things like water quality, because it does raise exactly the kind of moral and, in some cases, legal question that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising, which is that if the EPA has a legitimate concern about something, but yet it is the responsibility of state officials to administer the water system, the question then is, what does the EPA do?\xc2\xa0 Particularly if their concerns are not being heeded by the state and local government.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President has asked the EPA to do -- and I think the EPA Administrator made an announcement about this recently -- is to clarify exactly how that relationship should work so that the EPA is not put in a position where they\xe2\x80\x99re expected to keep private information that is critical to the health of the public.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is a situation that we need to avoid, and the EPA has taken another look at the rules and regulations that govern the relationship between state officials and federal officials to make sure that that kind of situation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t arise in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the legality of it all, but apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s a situation where the EPA, it would be illegal for them to essentially say there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem because it\xe2\x80\x99s a state responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that there are a bunch of rules and regulations that govern the relationship between the EPA and state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 And so they do have a -- they obviously want to try to follow that procedure.\xc2\xa0 What we need to make sure is that that procedure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t unnecessarily inhibit the ability of the EPA to make public information that could have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of the public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the decision-making by the EPA, is it part of the focus of the DOJ investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to the Department of Justice about what all they\xe2\x80\x99re taking a look at.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly want to be cautious about not unintentionally interfering in an ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one thing on the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Another way of looking at this whole thing is that President Obama appointed Senator Clinton to a very sensitive position.\xc2\xa0 They worked side by side in the Situation Room and in the trenches for years and years.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he endorse someone like that?\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he come out and -- it would seem perfectly natural.\xc2\xa0 The relationship he has with Senator Sanders pales in comparison, at least by the way anyone would like at this.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t he just playing politics?\xc2\xa0 Is he hedging his bets?\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he come out and say something much more supportive of his own former Secretary of State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely legitimate question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just -- (laughter) -- well -- here\xe2\x80\x99s, I think, the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply that he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only person that should have an opportunity to decide.\xc2\xa0 Democratic voters should be engaged in this process.\xc2\xa0 And there is a strong benefit to the Democratic Party to have people like Senator Sanders who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a long, personal relationship with the President of the United States, but yet has been remarkably effective in galvanizing support for his campaign among Democratic activists all across the country.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has been able to engage Democrats all across the country in the debate about the future of our country.\xc2\xa0 That is a good thing for the party.\xc2\xa0 And the President and his vision for the future of the country benefits from somebody like Senator Sanders having success in mobilizing Democrats to be actively engaged in the debate about the future of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, second, the President also believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that he himself benefitted from a vigorous primary campaign; that anybody who followed the President\xe2\x80\x99s election in 2007 and 2008, it was pretty obvious that the President improved dramatically as a candidate over the course of 2007 and 2008.\xc2\xa0 And if the primary process had been wrapped up in late to mid-February, the President would not have had the benefit of honing those skills, both on the stump and on the debate stage.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I will readily acknowledge that, at the time, that it was a little harder to discern that benefit; that those of us that had been moving from state to state, and certainly the President, who was spending days upon days and weeks upon weeks on the campaign trail in a way that nobody really expected, at the time felt like a little bit of a slog.\xc2\xa0 But in hindsight, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear that he benefitted from -- that his performance on the stump and his performance on the debate stage and his performance as a candidate improved as a result of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo any sort of presidential attempt to sort of head off that debate at this early stage by weighing on the primary isn\xe2\x80\x99t really going to benefit any of the candidates.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is the President wants to encourage a robust debate within the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to be good for both inspiring people to be active and engaged in the political process, but also it\xe2\x80\x99s going to sharpen the skills of all of the candidates involved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll that said, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily rule out an endorsement down the line.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, the President reserving his private preference -- or keeping his private preference private, I guess, has had important benefits for the party and important benefits for the candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair that that non-endorsement could be seen as a negative for Secretary Clinton?\xc2\xa0 Some will see it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that some will see it that way.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to lay out what the benefits are of the President keeping his private preference private and allowing the process to play out in a way that engages Democrats across the country and sharpens the skills of the Democratic candidates who are competing for those votes.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Staying with 2016, is it fair to say that the President believes that Hillary Clinton is better prepared to be President than Bernie Sanders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made public an assessment like that at this point.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President has talked about the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning he said she\xe2\x80\x99s better prepared than any non-Vice President to ever run for the office.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that was a clear acknowledgement of the skills and experience that she brings to the job.\xc2\xa0 But look, ultimately his preference in this contest is one that will be expressed in his absentee ballot in the Illinois primary.\xc2\xa0 If we choose to make that public, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staying -- actually, let me talk foreign policy for just a second.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw the report of President Rouhani making this grand European tour.\xc2\xa0 He made a comment in which he said, we invite American businessmen to join their European counterparts in investing with us as part of a win-win collaboration after years of mutual losses.\xc2\xa0 Is that how the President would see it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, President Rouhani has taken advantage of the opportunity to go and make his case around the world of why his country is open for business again.\xc2\xa0 And he makes that claim based on the significant steps that his nation has already taken to dismantle a significant portion of their nuclear infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ve also -- they did that by eliminating 98 percent of their enriched uranium stockpile; by essentially gutting the core of a plutonium reactor; dismantling -- or at least unplugging thousands of centrifuges; and agreeing to the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in exchange, we have -- the international community has allowed Iran to try to re-establish business ties with other countries and other companies around the world.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that Iran continues to be subject to significant sanctions -- not just here in the United States, but also in Europe, because of their ongoing support for terrorism, because of the human rights abuses that are all too common inside of Iran, and because of their continued development of a ballistic missile program in violation of their international obligations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said something important -- you said in sort of opening the possibility for investment.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that he can take some credit for that?\xc2\xa0 That by creating this Iran nuclear deal or at least having a hand in it, that now he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to assist the Iranians in opening their economy to the world again?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The goal of the nuclear agreement was focused on making sure that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program existed only for peaceful purposes, and that the international community had full transparency into their program so that they could confirm for ourselves that that program existed only for peaceful purposes.\xc2\xa0 And that is an objective that was achieved as a part of the nuclear agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would acknowledge that President Rouhani pursued that agreement for different reasons.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately our goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was achieved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably read the reports about Afghanistan and the potential that American troops could be there for decades.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see it that way?\xc2\xa0 And is this an acknowledgement that his best-laid plans when he campaigned on the idea of ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to play out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, when he ran for this office in 2007 and 2008, actually talked about the need to intensify our focus on Afghanistan to make sure that we are confronting the extremist threat that had led to the worst terrorist attack on American soil in 2001.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd under this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and because of the strategy that we put forward, and principally because of the courage, bravery, and professionalism of our men and women in uniform, we have decimated core al Qaeda that previously did capitalize on the instability in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So decades is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have always said is that the United States envisioned a long-term partnership with the government of Afghanistan, and that our commitment to economic development and shoring up their governing structures was a long-term commitment.\xc2\xa0 And again, this was a commitment not just made by the United States, but by the broader international community.\xc2\xa0 And we always did envision a scenario where there would be a U.S. embassy in Afghanistan that would be guarded by U.S. military personnel.\xc2\xa0 We envisioned the establishment of a security cooperation office at that embassy that would strengthen the military-to-military ties between Afghanistan and the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we always envisioned a long-term relationship between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 But right now, there is a military presence inside of Afghanistan by the United States and our NATO partners to focus on counterterrorism and on continuing to train and advise Afghan troops that are currently providing for the security situation in their own country.\xc2\xa0 And that effort continues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if I\xe2\x80\x99m understanding you, you\'re comfortable with the idea that for decades, potentially, there could be thousands of American troops in Afghanistan; that after 15 years of tireless effort by the women and men who fought in that country, the blood, the treasure, that\'s not going to be nearly enough.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re comfortable with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the scenario that we envision right now is that we would essentially draw down troop levels to about 5,500 troops by the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 Moving forward, the next Commander-in-Chief and his or her national security team taking advice from our commanders on the ground in Afghanistan will have to determine what sort of troop presence is appropriate for that country moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President envisions is a continued decrease in that number.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately that\'s a decision for the next President.\xc2\xa0 What is clear, though, again, is that our goal was to destroy the core al Qaeda cell that had planned and supported the worse terrorist attack on American soil back in 2001.\xc2\xa0 And that objective was achieved.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You said -- if I heard you correctly, you said the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made public his private preference in the Democratic primary contest.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he has one?\xc2\xa0 Or is he approaching the field with an open mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the President approached this with an open mind.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether or not the President has made a decision about whose -- about which candidate he will support in the Illinois primary.\xc2\xa0 But yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President is considering that decision -- or at least considered that decision with an open mind.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s decided at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you point to some areas where Senator Sanders and the President have worked together, either when he was in the Senate or during this administration?\xc2\xa0 And would you describe Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s role in advancing the President\xe2\x80\x99s objective as constructive or obstructive, or a little bit of both?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s one way to measure this, and that is that during the two years that they served in the United States Senate together, there were about 200 pieces of legislation that they either sponsored or co-sponsored.\xc2\xa0 I think that at least is one -- I would concede that is a relatively arbitrary measure, but at least it\'s one way to quantify the depth of their cooperation in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, Senator Sanders has made a name for himself in part because of his passionate advocacy for Wall Street reform and standing up for and fighting for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That\'s also been at the core of the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic policymaking agenda as well.\xc2\xa0 And while there are some differences in the details when it comes to their approach to those two issues, their agreement about championing the middle class being critical to the success of our country I think is probably the most prominent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are -- as it relates to other issues where they agree, based on what Senator Sanders said at the stakeout, it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s generally supportive of the broad approach the President has taken to fighting ISIL and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and some of those foreign policy issues.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to whether or not Senator Sanders agrees with all those things, you probably have to ask him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify the history of their meetings?\xc2\xa0 Have they met privately in the Oval Office before?\xc2\xa0 I think you said in the briefing that they have.\xc2\xa0 Was that a meeting that took place in December of 2014?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s when the meeting took place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what happened there?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a readout?\xc2\xa0 Do you know how that came together?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I think that was, frankly, a similar circumstance to this one, where Senator Sanders basically informed the White House of his intent to seek the Democratic nomination for the office of President.\xc2\xa0 And he, I think understandably, concluded that one thing to do might be to ask the last guy who successfully obtained the Democratic nomination for the office of President and spend some time talking to him.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what they did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t have a detailed readout of that meeting either. But, yes, there are at least two occasions in which Senator Sanders and President Obama have met privately in the Oval Office in the last year or so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last quick one.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think there should be more Democratic debates?\xc2\xa0 This is something of some controversy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s talk of adding an unsanctioned debate or reexamining the Democratic debate schedule.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been through this.\xc2\xa0 What does he think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that the Democratic National Committee, who actually is neutral in this race, should decide exactly what that debate schedule should be. It\'s my understanding that\'s something that they settled on many months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I have two questions about Senator Sanders, and then one unrelated question.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on what Byron was asking you, Senator Sanders was saying that he believes that the President is trying to be as evenhanded as possible.\xc2\xa0 Just process-wise, did the President extend to him any kind of conduit or contact that he can use to make sure that his relationship with the White House, should he need it, is facilitated in anything akin to the way that Secretary Clinton can access White House information?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think the fact that we were able to set up this meeting I think is an indication that when Senator Sanders needs to communicate with the President or senior members of the White House team here, that he has the capacity to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, other than leg affairs, what office or contact -- did the President setup any special -- like call Denis or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that anything like that was necessary.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that if, again, if Senator Sanders needs to get the attention of the President or anybody else here on the senior staff, that he\xe2\x80\x99s able to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question just to follow up on Byron, too.\xc2\xa0 Because the President has said that he wants to be a single-issue voter or assist himself in the Democratic Party on gun control, can you clarify whether the two men talked about gun control today and whether they\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page?\xc2\xa0 Would the President have any hesitation to be supportive of Senator Sanders on the basis of that issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not this came up in their private conversation.\xc2\xa0 And, again, as we talked about a couple of weeks ago, it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent from Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s public comments on this issue that he has arrived at a position and an agenda that is consistent with the kind of agenda we\xe2\x80\x99d expect of a candidate who supports common-sense gun-safety measures like those the President has said will have a significant impact on who he chooses not just to vote for but also to support and campaign for in the next election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the unrelated question is about Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl asked you about the budget, but I want to ask you, can you say whether the President -- the budgetary implications of his proposal to shutter Guantanamo as a prison will be included in the budget that would be released in early February so that lawmakers could see what the implications might be in the savings that he envisions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not this will be included in the budget, but obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to talk about that when we roll out the budget.\xc2\xa0 I do know that part of the plan that the Department of Defense has been working on for a number of months now includes a discussion of the fiscal impact of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and finding a more cost-effective way to detain those individuals who pose a threat to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the plan will be public before the release of the budget?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you on the timing of the Gitmo plan.\xc2\xa0 But when that plan is presented to Congress we\'ll make sure that all of you get a copy of it as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in the past, the President has sought the counsel or taken the counsel of Michael Bloomberg, particularly on guns.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s room for another billionaire in this race for President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mayor Bloomberg was just at the White House a couple of weeks ago, two or three weeks ago now, to discuss the effort that he has undertaken to make our communities safer from gun violence.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President has been deeply appreciative of the kind of investment and commitment that Mayor Bloomberg has made to this issue.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\'s important as well.\xc2\xa0 And they had an opportunity to talk about their efforts in the Oval Office just a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, Mayor Bloomberg will have to decide for himself if he wants to run for President.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it does seem like on about every 12 or 13 months we do see anonymous sources claiming to be familiar with the thinking of Mayor Bloomberg, speculating that he might even be considering a potential run for the presidency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, as I noted in the context of Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s deliberations, everybody around here is mindful of the kind of personal considerations that are included in a decision like that, and obviously that\'s a decision that only Mayor Bloomberg can make for himself.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not a decision that can be made by an anonymous source who claims to be familiar with his thinking.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the Politico interview that we discussed so far, there\xe2\x80\x99s a comment President Obama made when talking about Hillary Clinton -- he made that reference to sort of the Ginger Rogers analogy -- \xe2\x80\x9cShe had to do everything I did except backwards and in heels,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting she had it harder.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it\'s harder for female candidates running for office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the point that the President was making in the context of that interview is just simply that a long national campaign for the presidency is arduous and is physically demanding, and as tiring as the President found that process to be, it must have been even more challenging for Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Again, he noted -- he cited this example in his interview.\xc2\xa0 One example of that is, I would assume, based on very little personal knowledge, that it takes Secretary Clinton a little longer in the morning to do her hair than it does for the President of the United States to do his hair.\xc2\xa0 And that may seem like a rather prosaic observation, but ultimately, when you\'re talking about an 18- or 19-hour day, that matters.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the observation that the President was making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily only thinking of Hillary Clinton in that context.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he saying, generally speaking, a campaign as arduous as this one, it is just tougher for women to run for the same office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess in that context and with that sort of -- I would acknowledge that the unique challenges that were faced by Secretary Clinton in 2008 are probably familiar to women candidates who have competed in other political campaigns, even below the presidential level.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would take Trump a while to do his hair.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The last time I talked about Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s hair I got in a little trouble.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll let you make that observation, not me.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to clarify here, do you think, in the context of this race now, that gender is playing a role?\xc2\xa0 Was the President trying to go that far in this statement?\xc2\xa0 Or was he just speaking in what sounds like you\'re kind of characterizing in a lighthearted, sort of \xe2\x80\x9cit takes longer to get ready in the morning\xe2\x80\x9d context?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President was chiefly talking about is just why it is he had developed so much admiration for Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 And they have this -- look, it\'s a rather unique thing for two people to have participated in such an historic presidential election.\xc2\xa0 And it lasted a whole lot longer than most people expected.\xc2\xa0 It involved campaigning in states that had not recently been involved in -- or at least actively contested in the Democratic presidential primary process.\xc2\xa0 And while they were on different sides of the contest, they went through that contest together.\xc2\xa0 It was a searing experience for him, personally, but yet it was an experience that the two of them shared in common.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President was just making the observation that he found that process to be demanding, but his admiration for her was that it must have been even more physically demanding on her as she was going through that process.\xc2\xa0 And so I think he was just trying to explain why he admired her skills as a candidate, and her tenacity and her perseverance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd would that apply to other women candidates in the context of other races?\xc2\xa0 Yes, it potentially could.\xc2\xa0 But each race is a little bit different.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other remark in that interview I wanted to ask -- the President I guess expressed some regret for being so hard on Hillary Clinton the last time around, in 2008.\xc2\xa0 Is that sentiment felt here, elsewhere within the White House, given how deeply some of those competitive juices were flowing back then?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this now a sentiment that, in looking at the race now, people who worked on the campaign, the President himself said, wow, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten that tough?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think one thing that the President made clear once he made the decision to add Secretary Clinton to his Cabinet, and once he took office as President, he made clear to his staff that those old rivalries needed to be set aside for the good of the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think for the most part, that\'s what staff members who served on both campaigns did, because they recognized, particularly at that stage in our history where you had the broader American economy teetering on the edge of a cliff, that the stakes were too high to continue petty personal or political rivalries.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, some of that work happened in the context of the campaign in the general election.\xc2\xa0 There were a number of my colleagues who still work at the White House today who originally supported Secretary Clinton in the primary race, worked and supported Senator Obama in the general election, and now serve President Obama here.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Secretary Clinton, then-Senator Clinton, campaigned pretty aggressively for Senator Obama in the 2008 general election.\xc2\xa0 So that was part of a long-running process.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you take a look at the effectiveness of their working relationship once she became Secretary of State, I think you could observe that that process was successful.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about inversions.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, Johnson Controls and Tyco went through a merger.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a pretty big inversion that would cost the U.S. taxpayers about $150 million.\xc2\xa0 Senator Sanders said it would be a disaster for the taxpayer.\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton also spoke out against it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the White House has any statement or reaction to that deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a comment on any individual company\xe2\x80\x99s transaction.\xc2\xa0 What I will just say in general is the President has made clear that closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, whether those are individuals or corporations, is a top priority of his.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, we haven\'t seen Republicans embrace that notion, but we\'re going to continue to talk to them about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know that there are a number of steps the Treasury Department has already taken to make it more difficult for any company to engage in a transaction that allows them to avoid their tax bill unfairly.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to look at other policy proposals that would improve upon those efforts.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, we need legislation to address this loophole.\xc2\xa0 And that legislation continues to be high on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It does not seem like that legislation is moving forward in the Republican Congress at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yeah, unfortunately. \xc2\xa0And I think it is a good illustration, though, of the Republican priorities.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President made this observation at some recent public event: it\'s not middle-class families that are moving to a PO Box overseas so they can avoid paying their taxes.\xc2\xa0 Most middle-class families here in the United States stand up and pay their fair share.\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we ask the same thing of large corporations that benefit from the infrastructure in this country, that benefit from the talent pool that exists in this country, that benefit from the most -- being part of the biggest economy in the world, and a legal structure that allows their business to thrive?\xc2\xa0 It\'s time for them to pay their fair share, too.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how Republicans can make the case that that\'s somehow a bad idea.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why is there so much reluctance to speak out specifically about these deals when they come up?\xc2\xa0 Why not use the bully pulpit to try to stop some of these deals from happening since legislation doesn\'t seem to move forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the challenge here is that the -- obviously, there are elements of the U.S. government that have jurisdiction over individual companies.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\'t want to somehow suggest that our approach to regulating companies is going to be prejudiced based on some policy decision that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to weigh in on a decision that\'s made by an individual company -- frankly, particularly one that involves tax policy like this.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the principle is one that the President has talked about quite extensively and continues to be a top priority of the administration.\xc2\xa0 And look, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Treasury Department for an update on their ongoing efforts to address what we view as a pretty significant flaw in the tax code.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, kind of speaking of the Treasury Department, I think Secretary Lew was here this morning.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if Puerto Rico came up in that discussion.\xc2\xa0 We saw the readout of the discussion with Leader Pelosi and Harry Reid.\xc2\xa0 And it seems like Puerto Rico was one of the top issues that came up in terms of what the President wants out of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Did that issue come up?\xc2\xa0 Is the President coming up with a strategy for how to get Congress to move on Puerto Rico here in the next few weeks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are you asking if it came up in the meeting with Senator Sanders?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With Secretary Lew.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Secretary Lew is at the White House most mornings because he participates in the senior staff meeting in the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s Office.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have an update for you on any sort of specific internal deliberations on this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the administration considers this a priority, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for this to be a topic of some conversation here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, Secretary Lew has been at the forefront of our efforts to try to address the situation.\xc2\xa0 I know that he traveled to Puerto Rico just last week to meet with officials there.\xc2\xa0 And we were gratified at the end of last year when Speaker Ryan made a specific commitment to allow the House to vote on legislation that would not bail out Puerto Rico, but give Puerto Rico some more options for dealing with their financial challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question on potential executive actions on tax policy.\xc2\xa0 Senator Sanders, I think he wrote a letter to the President last year calling for the President to take some executive actions and close some loopholes.\xc2\xa0 And one of his advisors just came out this week and said that the President could -- or executive actions could close the carried interest loophole.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President or any of his advisors are looking at the authority or executive action to specifically address some of these tax loopholes that Congress doesn\'t seem to want to address.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any specific proposals that have been put forward.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the President has demonstrated a willingness to use his executive authority to try to advance priorities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified, even when it comes to tax policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the record, to get you to clarify, is it accurate for us to describe President Obama as impartial and neutral in the Democratic race both privately and publicly at this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair for you to say that the President has been conscientious about remaining publicly neutral in the presidential race.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there was no effort on his part to use the Politico interview as a way to signal a preference for one candidate over the other?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the goal of the Politico interview, as was evident for most of the discussion, was to have an opportunity to talk about his experience campaigning in Iowa, and why that was a meaningful experience for him both in terms of shaping his public identity, but also the way that it had an impact on his approach to public service and to fulfilling his responsibilities as President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the truth is that\'s how most -- that was the context for most the questions about both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders came up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Senator Sanders was on the President\xe2\x80\x99s public schedule, but his meeting last month with Secretary Clinton was not.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us why?\xc2\xa0 And will you be putting future meetings with candidates on the schedule?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there certainly were a number of concerns raised by people in this room about the fact that the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Secretary Clinton was not announced in advance.\xc2\xa0 And so we took that step with Senator Sanders last night to include on the nightly guidance that the President was intending to have this meeting today.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will endeavor to announce those kinds of meetings in advance in the future.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly going to protect the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to have a private conversation.\xc2\xa0 And there have been conversations that the President has had, for example, with former Speaker of the House John Boehner, when he was still in office, that were not announced in advance and were not actually even confirmed shortly after they were completed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President needs to have the ability to have private conversations with other political leaders, and we\'re going to protect his ability to do that.\xc2\xa0 But those kinds of meetings are obviously not the norm.\xc2\xa0 And when the President is having what would otherwise be described as a routine meeting with Senator Sanders, or somebody like Secretary Clinton, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll plan to announce it in the guidance of the night before.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another issue, is there any White House response to the Doomsday Clock announcement on Monday that it\xe2\x80\x99s keeping the clock at three minutes to midnight; that we are in a very dangerous environment?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I saw some news reports about that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that the President intends to convene the next installment of the Nuclear Security Summit here in Washington, D.C. in the next couple of months to talk about our ongoing efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And the President does believe in a longer-term role of trying to essentially nuclear disarm every country in the world.\xc2\xa0 I know the President believes that that would make the globe and the United States of America more safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that another factor in that analysis was climate change.\xc2\xa0 And while we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress in the context of the Paris agreement last year, for the first time we had more than 190 countries committing to reducing carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to need to see countries follow through on those commitments.\xc2\xa0 And there will be more work that needs to be done to confront the challenge of climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the good news is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a preliminary commitment on the part of these countries to taking that step.\xc2\xa0 And the President is optimistic about the kinds of economic opportunities that that creates for American businesses and American workers here in this country when it comes to the wind energy, or solar industry here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re optimistic about the current trajectory there.\xc2\xa0 But again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that more work needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tLauren, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama on Monday announced a ban on solitary confinement for juvenile offenders in the federal prison system, saying that the practice was overused and that it had the potential for death, stating psychological consequences, and then had an op-ed where he outlined a series of executive actions.\xc2\xa0 If bans like this -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a not a ban for adults.\xc2\xa0 If this is torture for children, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it torture for adults to put them in solitary confinement?\xc2\xa0 And what steps will be taken to remedy that, if any?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that the President was motivated to announce this policy change is because there are legitimate concerns that have been raised about the devastating mental toll that prolonged solitary confinement can have on inmates.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if we envision a criminal justice system that gives people a second chance, after they\xe2\x80\x99ve paid their debt to society, we need to make sure that they\'re equipped to do that.\xc2\xa0 And again, based on the studies that have been done about the impact of solitary confinement on one\xe2\x80\x99s mental health and mental condition, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make the case that we\'re giving people an opportunity to succeed in the normal world once they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to reenter mainstream society if they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through this terrible ordeal of being confined in a prison cell alone and limited in their ability to interact with other human beings.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a number of steps that are included in this announcement that include, even when individuals are held in solitary confinement, allowing them to spend more time outside their cell; trying to find other ways to detain individuals who might otherwise be put in solitary confinement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me give you one example.\xc2\xa0 Maybe a prisoner is having some mental problems, and too often right now the option is just to put them in solitary confinement until they calm down.\xc2\xa0 The question is if there are other ways to limit the ability of that individual to harm others or themselves, while also ensuring they get the kind of mental health treatment that they need.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that is included in this executive order are new limits on the use of this -- of solitary confinement as punishment, limiting the amount of time that they can be included in solitary confinement, as well as developing additional measures that can be instituted both as a punishment, but that will have less of a long-term negative impact on the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s mental health.\xc2\xa0 And greater communication with the inmate about being placed in restrictive housing is another part of this strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is mindful of the severe impact that solitary confinement can have on inmates.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward what he hopes will serve as a model for other law enforcement agencies to follow when it comes to implementing solitary confinement procedures.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which was one of the issues that he had raised at the State of the Union, saying that he wanted to find bipartisan support for things like this.\xc2\xa0 Can we expect anything like this in the future along the lines of the prison system?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President certainly continues to be very interested in criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 And while our goal is to get Congress to work in bipartisan fashion to pass criminal justice reform, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the President using his executive authority to take additional steps to reform the system in a way that he believes would make the American people more safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, that\xe2\x80\x99s what this is about.\xc2\xa0 It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about looking out for the interests and rights of individuals who are in the prison system.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 But if we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to give those individuals a second chance -- something we all believe in -- we need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not impairing their ability from the beginning to go out and develop relationships with their families when they get out of prison, and get a good job and be able to hold down that job.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99ve undergone this terrible mental trauma, then we\xe2\x80\x99re making it a lot harder for them to go out and do what we want them to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the ability of individuals to come out of the prison system, pay their debt to society, and start to make a positive contribution to our country ultimately makes all of us safer.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s aim here.</p>\n<p>\n\tJen, you got something real quick?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I just got to get going.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be late for a meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be really quick.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You and the President both have been pushing Congress to pass a new war authorization for ISIS for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Unexpectedly, last week, Mitch McConnell introduced a sweeping AUMF himself, and actually used a rule to expedite it to the floor and bring it up if he wants to.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President would support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at the actual text of the AUMF, but we believe that Congress has, for too long, put off their fundamental responsibility to pass the authorization to use military force against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, our men and women in uniform are fulfilling their responsibilities to keep the country safe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Congress to fulfill their responsibilities, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would the President support something as broad as that?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s basically an open-ended authorization to give the President any war powers he\xe2\x80\x99d like to go after ISIS.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked specifically at the proposal that Senator McConnell says he supports.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we believe that an authorization to use military force that\xe2\x80\x99s passed by Congress should reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibilities to weigh in here.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s our expectation that Congress should do; it\xe2\x80\x99s still unclear if they actually will fulfill that responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And speaking of war, Concepcion Picciotto is the woman who has been living in the tent out front for about 35 years, waging the longest peace protest in U.S. history.\xc2\xa0 She died this week.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to see if the President is aware at all of who she is and aware of this long-time fixture out there, and if he has anything to say about her and her vigil.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw some of the news coverage of this over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President is aware, but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that she had a lot of passion and conviction for trying to make the planet a safer place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thirty-five years.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And we certainly got to pay our respects, not just to the life that she lived but to her passion for making the world a safer and more peaceful place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:23 P.M.
