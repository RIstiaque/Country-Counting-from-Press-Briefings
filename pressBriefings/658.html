Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:52 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m here to take your questions, traditional briefing.\xc2\xa0 I would understand if folks need to go file -- that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 And I leave it to our friends in the front row to tell me how brief we can keep this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, keep it short.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Keep it short.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess just to start off, can you tell us a little bit about the process of having that -- said remarks happen?\xc2\xa0 Why did the President decide to do it now at the end of the week, almost a week after this verdict?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say a couple of things, because the process is far less important than the words the President spoke.\xc2\xa0 And he wanted to say something and he came out and said it, and he\'s obviously mindful of the discussions that have been going on.</p>\n<p>I think some of us had discussions earlier this week that when -- he was certainly prepared to take questions on this issue when he had some interviews earlier in the week, and would have answered them in probably similar fashion.\xc2\xa0 But he felt like today was a good day to speak about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just on Detroit, the Vice President said in his event earlier today that there have been some meetings at the White House on the situation there.\xc2\xa0 Is there any type of federal response or federal assistance that the White House deems appropriate in this situation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have heard leaders in Michigan say -- and we believe they\'re correct -- that this is an issue that has to be resolved between Michigan and Detroit and the creditors, when it comes to the insolvency of the city.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we are, of course, engaged in conversations with -- about policy options and other ways that we can be of assistance to Detroit, and that includes Gene Sperling, and Valerie Jarrett, and Shaun Donovan, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development -- all of whom have had discussions with the leadership team in Detroit and with leaders in Michigan.</p>\n<p>But on the issue of insolvency and on those matters, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that local leaders and creditors are going to have to resolve.\xc2\xa0 But we will be partners in an effort to assist the city and the state as they move forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any talk of a bailout for Detroit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, I would point you to what we have said and what leaders in Michigan and Detroit have said, which is that on the matter of their insolvency, that\xe2\x80\x99s something for the city and the creditors to resolve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how worried are you about the overall impact of this on the U.S. economy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything concrete to say about that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned, obviously, about the citizens of Detroit and of the state, and continuing to assist Detroit in moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And there has been, obviously, especially when it comes to the automobile industry, remarkable progress since the depths of the great recession, at which time there was the prospect of liquidation or elimination of the automobile industry in this country.\xc2\xa0 And this President said that was unacceptable to him, and he took action to prevent that from happening.\xc2\xa0 And now we see month after month and quarter after quarter of robust automobile sales, and some of the best cars being made in the world coming out of Detroit, broadly speaking.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously part of an effort to revitalize an iconic American industry, but one that\xe2\x80\x99s also very linked to this city.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, based on the President\'s remarks, would he like to see the Florida "stand your ground" law be repealed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that you heard from the President, and I will point you to what the President said on that issue and the other issues that he talked about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because he mentioned it specifically.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he spoke -- I think he made a very good point about his views on that, and it reflects -- or rather, in reverse, what I have said earlier this week about state laws and that law is that I think reflects what I knew the President felt, which is that we ought to be examining these and judging them by the standard of whether or not they contribute to or make worse the problem of gun violence.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is consistent with what the President just said.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President\'s statement seemed very thought out from before he gave the way forward, and even after with his points -- his four or five points on the way forward.\xc2\xa0 I just want a little tick-tock.\xc2\xa0 First of all, how long -- how hard was it for you guys to put this together, to make this happen?\xc2\xa0 Because he came out with some words and some things that we have not heard him say before -- even first-term Obama.\xc2\xa0 This is second-term Obama with a little bit more depth into issues of race, particularly the African American community.\xc2\xa0 How hard was that?\xc2\xa0 And did other communities -- I mean, like people come to him -- Stevie Wonder, who happens to be his friend; Reverend Al Sharpton -- who has he talked to about this?\xc2\xa0 What kind of bombardment, if there was, on him about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of internal deliberations or outside conversations to report to you.\xc2\xa0 This is not hard at all.\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to say something and he opened the briefing today so that he could say something.\xc2\xa0 That was pretty much it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when it comes to issues like this, obviously he has conversations with a lot of people, as he does on every issue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s any question -- and you can judge by what he just said and how he said it -- that he knows what he thinks, and he knows what he feels, and he has not just in the past week, but for a good portion of his life, given a lot of thought to these issues.</p>\n<p>So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in his pre-political life, with the book that he wrote, and throughout his career in the public world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, on Detroit, during the first term, the Obama administration had Detroit and New Orleans in a certain type of pot, if you will, because they had different issues than the average American city.\xc2\xa0 And then later on in the administration, they became a regular city, because they were dealing with regular issues like every other city.\xc2\xa0 But now Detroit is in bankruptcy.\xc2\xa0 Is Detroit now viewed by this White House in that special pot again, or in that special grouping, because they\'re having financial woes?\xc2\xa0 And how do you deal with Detroit now, since it\'s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, setting aside categorization, I would simply say that clearly the situation in Detroit is unique at this time given the declaration and the size of the city and the size of the challenges that Detroit faces.</p>\n<p>And you can see, based on what I told you about the conversations in meetings about Detroit here in the White House and broadly in the administration, that we\xe2\x80\x99re paying close attention to the challenges that Detroit is facing and looking for ways that we can be of assistance, being clear, as I have been and others have been that -- and including leaders in Michigan and in Detroit -- that the issue here of the insolvency and dealing with that is one that Detroit and Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s creditors will have to resolve.</p>\n<p>But we, of course, will be of assistance in general both in terms of policy as well as just being a partner with Detroit as Detroit finds its way and moves forward in the coming weeks, months and years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the President call the Martin family?\xc2\xa0 Have they talked at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any conversations to read out.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Detroit, the Vice President said that \xe2\x80\x9cwe talked to them about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Who is \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said Valerie Jarrett; Gene Sperling, the Director of the National Economic Council; Secretary Shaun Donovan, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\xc2\xa0 Those are the three principals that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of who have been in conversations with leaders in Detroit and Michigan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the President or the Vice President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, very quickly, Senators Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer have proposed a resolution where they\'re suggesting that calls for -- they\'re calling for moving the location of the G20 out of St. Petersburg if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t new progress or changes regarding the situation of Edward Snowden in Russia.\xc2\xa0 Curious if the White House has any thoughts or has given any consideration to asking them to change.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 The G20 is a body of 20 nations.\xc2\xa0 Russia is the host of the G20 this year in St. Petersburg, and it is our intention -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s intention to travel to Russia for that meeting.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what that proposition is meant to suggest.</p>\n<p>But on the issue obviously that sparks it, which is the disposition of Mr. Snowden, our message is what it has been, which is that he ought to be expelled and returned here to the United States where he will be afforded all of the significant rights given to defendants in this country as he faces charges related to the unauthorized publication of -- or unauthorized leaking of classified -- very sensitive classified information.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you say the city of Detroit needs to work it out with its creditors, are you then ruling out any federal aid of some sort?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that when people ask me the question about -- and others have asked the question about can the -- are we going to solve this problem, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been made clear by local leaders and state leaders and by us that the broader issue here is one for -- that has to be resolved between the city and its creditors.</p>\n<p>We will, of course, as we would with any city in this country, work with that city and have policy discussions with leaders in the city, and make suggestions and offer assistance where we can.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to say, as I have several times already today, that when local leaders and state leaders say that the matter here of insolvency is one that has to be resolved between the city and its creditors, we concur on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you give an idea of what kind of -- when you say \xe2\x80\x9cassistance,\xe2\x80\x9d any idea?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any -- we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to work with Detroit, moving forward, to help it move forward, but I don\'t have a specific idea to present to you today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just one other one.\xc2\xa0 The Federal Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, does it have any role in a situation like this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking the wrong person.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to maybe direct that question to Treasury or elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you give us a few more details on what the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed over the phone?\xc2\xa0 Also, Secretary Kerry met with Palestine leader Mahmoud Abbas today in Ramallah.\xc2\xa0 What was the message given to him and Palestine?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Second question on the peace talks with Taliban.\xc2\xa0 Since Taliban office was closed in Doha almost 10 days ago, is the U.S. administration preparing another plan for Taliban and Afghan government before G20 Summit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let me take these in relative order.\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the second question first, which is with regards to Secretary Kerry and his travels, as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s in the Middle East this week as part of our efforts to bring the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 Those meetings are ongoing, and I don\'t have anything to say at this point that would get ahead of those discussions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I believe Secretary Kerry will address some issues perhaps later today.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything from here to say about that beyond noting that he has been working on this issue very hard in trying to get the two parties to return to negotiations.</p>\n<p>On the matter of the Taliban, we have said all along that we absolutely believe that reconciliation is the only ultimate path forward for Afghanistan to achieve peace.\xc2\xa0 Afghans have to have these negotiations with Afghans.\xc2\xa0 And the Doha office has been a -- is a means by which that process could move forward, but the Taliban has to decide that it wants to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And if it does not -- if they do not, then we will continue to look for avenues and means for pursuing reconciliation, but ultimately the Taliban have to decide to make that choice themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on that.\xc2\xa0 We certainly -- again, as a long-term proposition, reconciliation is essential, and that is something -- an opinion we share with the Afghan government, and we will be strong partners with the Afghan government going forward in that effort.\xc2\xa0 But the Taliban have to decide to participate and under the conditions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some details, did the President talk with --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on that.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President and the Prime Minister speak and meet with some frequency and discuss a range of issues, both bilateral and related to the region, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more specifics about that phone call.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, after Sandy Hook, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cstand your ground\xe2\x80\x9d a bigger part of the President and the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives on gun violence?\xc2\xa0 Was it considered too difficult or too contentious?\xc2\xa0 Or was it not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me whether a Florida State law was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, this was meant to be a comprehensive look at gun violence around the country and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I concede your point that there are other issues that can be looked at that go beyond even -- or are in addition to what the President\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive plan to deal with gun violence addresses.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting, that this is another issue that can be looked at, we believe, not just in Florida but around the country when we\xe2\x80\x99re examining --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over 30 states have those laws.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that -- you seem to be trying to make some sort of pressing point here.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President talk about, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, the fact that it would be a good idea for states to review laws like that and make assessments about whether they, in fact, contribute to or reduce gun violence in their communities.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they should be reexamined and perhaps changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about it now and not necessarily before the Martin case -- the Zimmerman case was resolved?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty self-evident that the Martin/Zimmerman case elevated awareness about this issue and this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to jump the week ahead here, but can you give us some details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans next week and the economic message that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be touching on while he\xe2\x80\x99s out in the Midwest?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will welcome NCAA Champion Louisville Cardinals to the White House to honor the team and their 2013 NCAA Men\xe2\x80\x99s Basketball Championship.\xc2\xa0 This visit will also continue the tradition begun by President Obama of honoring sports teams for their efforts to give back to communities as part of their trip to Washington.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will travel to Galesburg, Illinois and Warrensburg, Missouri for events on the economy.</p>\n<p>On Thursday morning, the President will welcome the President of Vietnam to the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President welcomes the opportunity to discuss with President Sang how to further strengthen our partnership on regional strategic issues and enhance our cooperation with ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 The President also looks forward to discussing human rights, emerging challenges such as climate change, and the importance of completing a high standard Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, the President will travel to Jacksonville, Florida for an event on the economy.</p>\n<p>And on Thursday evening, the President will host an Iftar dinner celebrating Ramadan at the White House.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>So beyond the announcement of that travel, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details for you except to say that the economy and the things that we can do help it grow and to strengthen and secure and expand the middle class has been, is, and will be the central focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason he\xe2\x80\x99s doing it that week?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it anything that it is going to be tied to or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details for you, Mike, sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just ask you one follow-up question on Jared\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Another law that has a lot of blacks and Hispanics upset is one in New York; it\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cstop and frisk\xe2\x80\x9d law.\xc2\xa0 Ray Kelly -- who Obama has been very complimentary about in recent days regarding the DHS post -- has overseen this.\xc2\xa0 Is that the type of law the President would be concerned about, particularly in nominating Ray Kelly?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re getting -- on the personnel issues, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting way ahead of yourself and in the process.\xc2\xa0 So let me leave that there.</p>\n<p>And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a conversation with him or anyone here about that particular law.\xc2\xa0 I think in general, obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had discussions about the \xe2\x80\x9cstand your ground\xe2\x80\x9d law because of its relevance to the case that put in on the consciousness of so many people.\xc2\xa0 But I think, broadly speaking, this would be something we would encourage all states to look at in term of ways that we can reduce gun violence in our communities.</p>\n<p>All set?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on the week ahead, please?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was reported today that he\xe2\x80\x99s also going to talk about immigration on the Midwest trip on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- can we confirm that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where it was reported.\xc2\xa0 I just reported that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, isn\xe2\x80\x99t immigration part of the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I have no more details.\xc2\xa0 In fact, comprehensive immigration reform --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, great.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure this is of interest to at least one reporter -- would significantly reduce our deficit, would expand economic growth, would raise wages, and would enhance the creation of innovative businesses by entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 So a win-win no matter how you look at it.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M.
