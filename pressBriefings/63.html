Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:52 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I hope you\'ve all recovered from a busy weekend of source-building.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I know it was all business all the time over the weekend for everybody in this room.\xc2\xa0 So hope you found time for a little fun, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tI do not have any announcements to start.\xc2\xa0 So, Kevin, we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\'s reaction to Puerto Rico\'s default of $370 million in bond payments?\xc2\xa0 Did it have better options?\xc2\xa0 And will this default create more urgency for lawmakers and the Obama administration to work something out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I sure hope it creates a new sense of urgency for members of Congress to address this situation.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a situation that we\'ve been concerned about for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 It\'s now been 194 days since the administration put forward our legislative proposal for addressing this situation.\xc2\xa0 So I think that should be an indication to you and to the people of Puerto Rico that the administration has been focused on this for six months now.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the kind of movement in the Republican-led Congress that we need to see to make a bailout of Puerto Rico less likely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe truth is, what the administration is seeking is to empower the Puerto Rican government with the kind of restructuring authority that cities all across the country have.\xc2\xa0 And the administration believes that that restructuring authority should be contingent on the Puerto Rican government making some needed financial reforms.\xc2\xa0 We also believe that there should be a mechanism for accountability and verifying that those reforms are being appropriately implemented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s why it\'s wrong for people to describe this as a bailout.\xc2\xa0 But the situation gets worse by the day.\xc2\xa0 And some days, in some situations -- in some days, the situation gets notably worse.\xc2\xa0 And it only makes a bailout more likely, which is why we continue to press hard for Republicans in Congress to stop dragging their feet and to address a situation that\'s having a negative impact on more than 3 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there better options than today\'s default, such as maybe slashing government services?\xc2\xa0 Is that the route Puerto Rico should have gone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'d be hard-pressed to make that case.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m certainly no financial expert.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of all of the options that were available to the Puerto Rican government.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s anybody here who can -- well, I\'ll just say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any good options for the Puerto Rican government at this point.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly why this restructuring authority is badly needed.\xc2\xa0 You might even say that it\'s overdue.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s also why a set of financial reforms is overdue, because there clearly are some significant problems that are plaguing the Puerto Rican government\'s budget but also having a negative impact on the broader economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this situation requires an urgent response, and Republicans in Congress have been dragging their feet for too long.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about where the President stands on this idea of creating safe zones within Syria?\xc2\xa0 In the past, he\'s described them as impractical.\xc2\xa0 And I would like to ask you, what has changed and what is the U.S. prepared to do to enforce these safe zones?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So, Kevin, I think there has been, in the lexicon here of describing the chaotic situation in Syria, there has been some, shall we say, confusion.\xc2\xa0 The confusion does not stem from any government officials that I\'ve seen, but it does apply to some observers of the situation.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s view of safe zones has not changed.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe at this point that safe zones are a practical alternative to what currently is happening in Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 There have been some who have advocated for the creation of no-fly zones or safe zones inside of Syria that would essentially provide a sanctuary for Syrian citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is concerned about that kind of proposal because it puts the United States on the hook for essentially safeguarding the safe zones.\xc2\xa0 That would require a significant commitment of ground troops.\xc2\xa0 It would also put those ground troops on the front lines, because presumably you would have ISIL trying to encroach on those safe zones or trying to infiltrate them, and it could set up a very dangerous situation for American forces that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually make a lot of progress in terms of degrading and destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the context in which safe zones has most recently been mentioned has been in the context of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 The cessation of hostilities was an agreement that the United States, Russia, and the rest of the international community, including the Assad regime, signed on to at the beginning of the year.\xc2\xa0 And we warned -- we were aware at the beginning of the implementation of that cessation of hostilities that there were likely to be violations; that the implementation of that cessation of hostilities was likely to be bumpy.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is, for most of the last couple of months, that cessation of hostilities has worked more effectively in reducing the violence in Syria than most people thought.\xc2\xa0 And we were, frankly, surprised that the level of violence did reduce as much -- did come down as far as it did.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been violations all along.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the last couple of weeks is that we\'ve seen an increase in the severity and frequency of violations of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And what we have sought to do is to refresh that cessation of hostilities in those areas of the country where we\'ve seen it start to fray.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has been engaged in conversations with the Russians to try to get them to use their influence with the Assad regime to go back to living up to the commitments that they made in the context of the cessation of hostilities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 This is a nationwide commitment that has been made.\xc2\xa0 And in many places in the country it has yielded positive impacts on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But there are some areas where it has started to fray.\xc2\xa0 And that is where we are reinforcing our efforts to refresh the cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying this is a much narrower area of safe zones?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would not call it safe zones.\xc2\xa0 I would not call it safe zones.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are some observers who are describing it as safe zones.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen anybody in the U.S. government refer to them as safe zones.\xc2\xa0 I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t referred to them as safe zones.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is that it gets too complicated to try to differentiate between what we\'re talking about here.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear:\xc2\xa0 The President is against safe zones.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s expressed that from the beginning because he doesn\'t want to put the United States in the situation of trying to enforce it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe focus of our military should be on degrading and destroying ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We should, however, collectively as an international community, be conscientious about living up to the commitments that were made by all the parties in the context of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 In those areas where we\'ve seen the cessation start to fray in recent weeks, we need to reinforce our efforts to refresh the cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in particular, the Assad regime needs to live up to the commitments that they have made.\xc2\xa0 And we would like to see the Russians use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to get them to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess this is the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about it.\xc2\xa0 Russia did that once before.\xc2\xa0 For several weeks we did have the effective implementation of a cessation of hostilities in which the Assad regime did curb their military activities.\xc2\xa0 Just in the last couple of weeks we\'ve seen the Assad regime go back to some of the nasty tactics.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the Russians go back to using their influence with the Assad regime to get them to live up to the cessation of hostilities in the way that they did before.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the Greenpeace leaks of T-TIP.\xc2\xa0 Today, Greenpeace published about half of the deal that\'s being negotiated, on a website.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve already seen the response from USTR on this.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can tell us how damaging the White House feels that these leaks are for the prospects of reaching some kind of deal before the President leaves office.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to the veracity of any of the documents that have been published.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that we\'re not particularly concerned about these purported leaks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe truth is the President has been very clear about what our strategy is when it comes to international trade.\xc2\xa0 The President around the world has sought high-standard agreements.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is simple:\xc2\xa0 That\'s consistent with our values.\xc2\xa0 We believe that there should be high standards when it comes to human rights and labor rights and worker rights and environmental standards.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we want the world to observe higher standards.\xc2\xa0 But we also know that if the rest of the world observes those higher standards, that\'s going to level the playing field for American businesses and workers that already observe those standards.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s going to create expanded economic opportunity for the American people.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the kind of trade strategy that the President has pursued in Asia, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of strategy that has guided our participation in the T-TIP talks.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to the veracity of those documents, I just don\'t have any comment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you concerned about the implications of these leaks on public opinion about T-TIP and how that might affect the eventual negotiations toward a deal by the end of the year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 And as the President described when he was in Europe just last week, our focus is on trying to complete these negotiations by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that we\'re going to be able to get Congress to act on it and have this agreement going into effect before the President leaves office.\xc2\xa0 But there is the potential -- and we certainly are aiming -- to complete these talks by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything about this leak that is going to have a material impact on our ability to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And over the weekend there was what\xe2\x80\x99s being called an unprecedented breach of Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s Green Zone -- hundreds of people storming over the glass walls around the zone, demanding political reforms.\xc2\xa0 And this happened right after the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s visit, obviously.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what your assessment is of what the visit accomplished and how concerned is the White House that this upheaval is really starting to -- or going to interfere with the fight against the Islamic State and plans for the coalition to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces as they begin to look at Mosul.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost two weeks ago now that the President did a news conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where he was asked quite directly by a journalist from The Washington Post about the political situation inside of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And the President noted at the time that he was concerned about the situation there.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe noted that the dynamics of the political debate inside of *Syria Iraq right now are a little bit different than they traditionally have been; that the political dialogue right now that has been so challenging is not one that breaks down along sectarian lines, but rather some disagreement within the Shia community in Iraq about the proper way to govern the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this presents some unique challenges.\xc2\xa0 And given the concerns about the situation inside of Iraq, Vice President Biden made his first trip to Iraq in more than four years.\xc2\xa0 So I think the significance of a vice presidential visit underscores the significance of the challenges that are facing Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s message was to reiterate our support for the reforms that are being pursued by the Abadi-led government.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President also used his visit to underscore the U.S. and international community\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to economic support for Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There are significant economic reforms that the government needs to implement.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also some needed assistance that can be provided to Iraqi authorities that are seeking to rebuild communities that ISIL had previously controlled.\xc2\xa0 And that is going to be a critical part of our effort to prevent ISIL from retaking those communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President spent a lot of time talking about the need to support this Iraqi effort when he met with the GCC countries in Riyadh last week -- two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then the final thing that I think is important for people to understand is Vice President Biden was also there to talk about ongoing U.S. and international support for the military campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Those military efforts in Iraq are led by Iraqi forces that are under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 And we have been able to effectively work with Iraqi forces to drive ISIL out of about 40 percent of the populated territory that they previously held.\xc2\xa0 That represents important progress.\xc2\xa0 And we are looking for ways to keep that momentum going, including beginning to support Iraqi operations around Mosul to eventually prepare for the retaking of that city.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is obviously a lot of business that Vice President Biden was engaged in while he was in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And those conversations took place at a critical time for that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\'s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Andrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up question on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The events of the weekend have obviously shown again how powerful Muqtada al-Sadr is.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could just remind us of what the U.S. position is with regard to him?\xc2\xa0 Do U.S. officials meet with him?\xc2\xa0 Do you consider him an interlocutor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any high-level government meetings between U.S. officials and Muqtada al-Sadr.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d check with the State Department about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s participated in any other broader meetings that may have included U.S. officials.\xc2\xa0 So you should confirm that information with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you would acknowledge that he is an important figure in Iraqi politics, even if he doesn\'t play a formal role?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no expert in trying to divine what sort of influence individual figures in Iraq may have in the political situation there.\xc2\xa0 I think as a matter of policy, the U.S. government certainly respects the sovereignty of the nation of Iraq and the responsibility that the Iraqi people have to determine political outcomes in their country.\xc2\xa0 We\'re entirely respectful of that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, Andrew, in reading the news coverage over the weekend and in talking to some senior officials here at the White House who work on this issue all the time, I was reminded of the summer of 2014.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when ISIL made its dramatic advance across the Iraqi desert and deeply encroached into Iraqi territory, there were significant questions raised about what the U.S. role would be in trying to get ISIL out of the country.\xc2\xa0 In those early days the question was what the United States would do to protect Iraq from ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall at the time the President laid down a pretty clear marker that addressing the political failures of the Maliki government in Iraq was necessary before the United States could commit to the kind of military support that we\'re providing now.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is -- the assessment of our experts here is that Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s focus on governing along sectarian lines inside of Iraq significantly weakened the Iraqi government, but it also had a deleterious impact on the competence of Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 You essentially had some forces that were unwilling to defend some parts of the country based on the sectarian identification of the population.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Obama made clear that a military commitment on the part of the United States would be contingent upon the establishment of an Iraqi central government that prioritized uniting the country across sectarian lines; that the ability of Kurds and Sunnis and Shia in Iraq to work together to defeat ISIL was going to be critical to their success.\xc2\xa0 And Prime Minister Abadi has demonstrated a commitment to prioritizing a government philosophy that unites the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States has been supportive of his efforts to implement reforms, but ultimately those reforms need to be responsive to the concerns and priorities of the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s his top priority.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the leader of a sovereign nation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States can be supportive of his efforts, but ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister Abadi listening to the Iraqi people that will make decisions about how to effectively run that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think Abadi is backsliding slightly on his promises to make a non-sectarian government?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he has demonstrated during his time \xe2\x80\x93- speaking broadly, he has demonstrated during his time in office that he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to a multi-sectarian Iraq, and he has governed consistent with that vision.\xc2\xa0 For him, it\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate national security priority and I think he understands the stakes.\xc2\xa0 I also think he\xe2\x80\x99s not just doing that because it\xe2\x80\x99s his own personal preference and because it\xe2\x80\x99s critical to the national security of the country; I think he\xe2\x80\x99s doing that because he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of the ambitions of the Iraqi people and that the success of his country will depend upon his success in unifying that country to counter the challenges that they currently face.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause, look, we also have to remember it\xe2\x80\x99s not just ISIL that poses a threat to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Iraq is going through some pretty challenging, wrenching changes to their economy.\xc2\xa0 The significantly lower price of oil has proved to be a significant challenge to that country.\xc2\xa0 There are also challenges related to their infrastructure, like repairing the Mosul Dam, that are time-consuming both in terms of the amount of money that\xe2\x80\x99s required to deal with that situation but it also requires a level of expertise that is not easily found.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are some significant challenges, and Prime Minister Abadi is dealing with a lot right now.\xc2\xa0 And the rest of the international community is going to be supportive of him as he tries to make the changes consistent with his responsibilities as the Prime Minister of Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, I just wanted to follow on the second part of Roberta\xe2\x80\x99s question, which is the impact of the instability.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, on plans to retake Mosul, obviously those efforts are going to take buy-in from all the different parts of competing interests within Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And there had been a sense, I think after the trip, that the political situation had calmed, planning to kind of finalize how they were going to go into Mosul could continue and be completed to prevent inaction.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, now that there seems to be backsliding there, if the President\'s sort of perceived deadline at the end of the year is in danger or could be pushed back farther.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, based on the briefings that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received this morning, our national security professionals have not detected any impact on our ongoing counter-ISIL activities in Iraq, based on the political instability in Baghdad over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 The United States and our coalition partners conducted 59 airstrikes and six artillery strikes against ISIL targets in northern Iraq and Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 That was just over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 And the ongoing effort to offer training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi forces has continued unabated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we have said all along is that specific military decisions like when to begin the operation against Mosul will be made by Iraqi forces and the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 Again, we continue to respect the sovereignty of this independent nation, and we continue to partner with them and work effectively with them, both to carry out ongoing operations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, but also to plan for future military operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Flint later this week.\xc2\xa0 Governor Snyder has been under a lot of pressure, and eventually he kind of did a photo-op to drink the tap water in Flint as a sign of solidarity.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is going to drink the filtered Flint water while he is there and if he also plans to meet with Governor Snyder.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any photo-ops that involve the President\xe2\x80\x99s consumption of water.\xc2\xa0 Based on what the EPA has communicated to the public, is that properly filtered water in Flint is safe to drink.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly would encourage people to continue to listen to the advice that they get from our scientific and public health experts about what water is safe to drink, and the President will certainly follow that advice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the last thing is, news came of Malia\xe2\x80\x99s college plans over the weekend, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you might be able to shed any insight on what she\xe2\x80\x99s doing with her gap year.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I cannot.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to follow up kind of on Justin.\xc2\xa0 And I have another question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an urban week for the President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s traveling to Flint and then he\xe2\x80\x99s also doing the Howard University commencement.\xc2\xa0 Are there any threads that are going to travel through to both of his speeches, in Flint and in Howard?\xc2\xa0 And will he be making any news when it comes to the urban front?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, stay tuned.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to begin previewing the President\xe2\x80\x99s commencement address at Howard at this point, but the President and his team have been working on his speech for a couple of weeks now.\xc2\xa0 But check in later this week, and maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to give you a better sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans are for that speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And I also want to ask you -- this weekend at his last White House Correspondents\xe2\x80\x99 Association Dinner, he gave jokes, got some ribbing.\xc2\xa0 What did he think about the final words that were delivered to him and of him, the President of the United States -- a word that is one of the worst words many people say you could say to anyone, that\'s gone down in history?\xc2\xa0 What did he think about that?\xc2\xa0 What\'s his reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I think the first thing that I would observe is that any comedian who signed up to follow President Obama at the White House Correspondents\' Dinner is assuming one of the most difficult tasks in comedy.\xc2\xa0 Just by nature of the engagement, that\'s a tough job, following the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama also, over the years, has shown himself to be rather adept at delivering a speech that consists primarily of one- or two-liners, and the President enjoys that opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is that Mr. Wilmore had a difficult job that he was facing on Saturday, and the President\'s expectation is he took -- as Mr. Wilmore took on that responsibility, is that comedians are going to go right up to the line.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he cross the line?\xc2\xa0 Many African Americans in that room, to include civil rights leaders, black comedians, were very appalled.\xc2\xa0 Even members of the Republican Party -- black Republicans were upset, black Democrats were upset.\xc2\xa0 People felt that not just throwing it at him, but throwing it at them, and also it diminished the office of the presidency and it diminished him.\xc2\xa0 Did he cross the line?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, what I would say is that it\'s not the first time that people, on the Monday after the White House Correspondent\'s Dinner, that some people have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line.\xc2\xa0 That happened in 2006, after Stephen Colbert delivered his speech.\xc2\xa0 There were many people who felt like he had overstepped his bounds in delivering his remarks.\xc2\xa0 To a lesser extent, many people made the same observation about the presentation of Wanda Sykes in 2009.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not the first time that we\'ve had a conversation like this in which these kinds of concerns have been raised or expressed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I had an opportunity to speak to the President about this briefly this morning, and he said that he appreciated the spirit of the sentiments that Mr. Wilmore expressed.\xc2\xa0 He ended his speech by saying that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put into words the pride that he felt in the President.\xc2\xa0 And he made the observation that our country has make remarkable progress just in his lifetime -- from not being willing to accept an African American quarterback, to electing and reelecting an African American not just to lead the United States, but to lead the free world.\xc2\xa0 Again, I take Mr. Wilmore at his words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lifetime, and something that he seemed to be pretty obviously proud of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Mr. Wilmore\'s use of freedom of speech give the President\'s detractors fodder now to be able to be able to call him that and call others that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no idea what impact Larry Wilmore\'s speech is going to have on the President\'s critics, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\'m going to spend much time worrying about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that there is a conversation about that word.\xc2\xa0 The President, in June of last year, used it as a teaching moment to show that issues of race are still a problem in this country.\xc2\xa0 But Wilmore used it for the President somewhat as a butt of the joke.\xc2\xa0 And you were in that room, as well as I was.\xc2\xa0 There was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness.\xc2\xa0 And people didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to handle that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I know this is a word that does -- let me say it this way:\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that Mr. Wilmore used the word by design.\xc2\xa0 He was seeking to be provocative.\xc2\xa0 But I think any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the President as the butt of a joke.\xc2\xa0 So what is true is that this is a tough assignment that any comedian takes on when they sign up for this job.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s expectation when he walks in that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get much closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a joke.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to be very clear:\xc2\xa0 So the President is okay with his use and how he used the N-word, "jiggaboo," "Negro Night," and thug"?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I\'ll just restate what I said before, which is that the President expressed -- well, what the President said is that he appreciated the spirit of Mr. Wilmore\'s expressions on Saturday night.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on one of Justin\'s questions about the Flint trip.\xc2\xa0 Governor Snyder told reporters this morning he\'s looking to meet with the President.\xc2\xa0 So is that meeting going to happen on Wednesday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess his schedule got a little freed up, huh?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess so.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess so.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still putting together the President\'s visit.\xc2\xa0 It\'s traditional for the President, when he travels to a state, to invite the governor to at least greet him on the tarmac.\xc2\xa0 That invitation was extended to Governor Snyder in the context of this visit.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re obviously pleased that it looks like he\'ll now be in Flint on that day.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll keep you posted on what sort of interactions they may have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Supreme Court fight, the President is doing a series of local interviews this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know some of the groups that are allied with the White House are doing some protests and other things like that in some of the states where Republican senators reside, over the recess.\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m wondering from you is, what are you looking for out of these actions over this week?\xc2\xa0 I know your ultimate goal is hearings and a vote.\xc2\xa0 But what needs to happen over this week for you to define your efforts as a success?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jordan, we\'re going to continue to apply pressure to Republicans to do their job.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a pretty simple message that we\'re delivering.\xc2\xa0 Since 1875, every Supreme Court nominee, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t later been retracted by the President of the United States, has received a hearing and/or a vote by the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why what Republicans are vowing to do is unprecedented and a dramatic escalation of partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 That\'s problematic because, even in this era of divided government and polarized politics, there\'s been an effort by both sides to try to insulate the U.S. justice system and the institution of the United States Supreme Court from that political stray voltage.\xc2\xa0 But Republicans have, in this case, ramped it up.\xc2\xa0 Look, even Senator Graham, who served four years on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has acknowledged that what Republicans are vowing to do and are doing is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSeveral Republicans -- or at least a couple of them come to mind -- have indicated that they\'re treating President Obama\'s nominee differently than they would treat a nominee that\'s put forward by a Republican President.\xc2\xa0 They\'re acknowledging that this is not driven by some peculiar reading of the Constitution, but it\'s driven by a raw, partisan political calculation that Republicans in the Senate have made to obstruct this nominee not because of any concerns about the nominee\'s judicial philosophy; they\'re obstructing this nominee simply because Chief Judge Garland was put forward by Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0 That\'s unfortunate particularly when you consider that Chief Judge Garland is somebody who has more experience on the federal judiciary than any Supreme Court nominee in American history.\xc2\xa0 He served on the second-highest court in the land for 19 years.\xc2\xa0 In taking a close look at that record, it\'s evident that he understands that the job of a federal judge is to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the argument that we\'ll make.\xc2\xa0 I recognize -- I would acknowledge that this is an argument that we\'ve spent a lot of the last two months making.\xc2\xa0 But this is an opportunity for the President to sit before local television anchors and make the argument once again, and present it, hopefully, in a compelling way that will have an impact on the constituents of five or six Republican senators.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any real movement on the question of hearings or -- hearings or a vote from these five senators, despite you making these arguments over and over again.\xc2\xa0 So if we don\xe2\x80\x99t hear movement over this next week when you\'re applying that pressure, is that going to be concerning to you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we started out with Republicans across the board -- at least the Senate Republican Leader saying that Republicans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t meet with the President\'s nominee.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, Chief Judge Garland has now met with 14 different Republican senators, and there are more plans for when Congress returns from their weeklong recess next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have made some progress in that regard, and we\'re going to continue to just apply pressure to Republicans until I make the case that they should do their job.\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'ve said this before too:\xc2\xa0 The American people expect that if you\'re going to show up every two weeks and collect a paycheck, that you should do your job.\xc2\xa0 And right now, Senate Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing it despite the fact they are picking up a six-figure paycheck.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 First, back to the safe zones question.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to clarify -- what you guys call them are "safe areas," not "safe zones," correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s a term of art, Mike.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re trying to do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the President called it safe areas when he was asked about this during the press conference with President [sic] Merkel in Germany, and he said there\'s no space between him and Chancellor Merkel on the question of whether or not there are areas to carve out in Syria that he would support the idea of carving out what he called "safe areas" through the political process.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to make sure that what you\'re suggesting seems to be different than what the President said during that news conference.\xc2\xa0 He says he supports the idea of carving out some safe areas in Syria through the political process.\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support any such thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, what we\'re trying to do is we\'re trying to put back in place a cessation of hostilities across the country.\xc2\xa0 The cessation of hostilities applies everywhere in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President said, "If we can get the political transition to separate out areas where a moderate oppositions that\'s at the table controls it, that should be a safe area.\xc2\xa0 If it\'s ISIL or Nusra, that\'s not a safe area.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the concept we\'ve been trying to build."</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that suggests that there are -- I mean, short of a complete cessation of hostilities -- which I suppose you would support, first and foremost -- but short of that, it does seem like the President supports the idea of creating some space inside Syria that is safe, whether you call it a zone or an area.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what our goal, Mike, is to reinforce the effective implementation of a cessation of hostilities nationwide in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And there are particular areas where there have been repeated and increasing violations of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And our goal is to reinforce our effort to refresh the cessation of hostilities in those areas where we\'ve seen violations.\xc2\xa0 But that is not a reference to any sort of new tactic to try to address the political situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Our goal all along has been to implement a cessation of hostilities all across the country to try to add some momentum to the ongoing political talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that I have said before, but not from the context of these conversations that\xe2\x80\x99s a relevant fact, is neither Nusra or other extremist groups like ISIL have signed on to the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 So we would like to see a cessation of hostilities all across the country, but that is not going to have an impact on the ability of the United States or our coalition partners to go after ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on a second topic, back to Flint.\xc2\xa0 The President and the White House has been highly critical I think of the state environmental apparatus in Michigan for their failures, as have a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 As the President goes back, what is the President prepared to say or apologize for in terms of the federal government and the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s failures to act more quickly in the face of the water problems in Flint?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there have been some lower-level resignations from EPA -- and I know that some of the federal officials have been there since and are I guess going back ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit -- but is the President prepared to say to the people of Flint that we screwed up too, at the federal level?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President is prepared to acknowledge that, as President of the United States, he takes responsibility for lots of things.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that the blue-ribbon independent commission that was appointed by the Republican governor of the state of Michigan found, \xe2\x80\x9cprimary responsibility for the water contamination in Flint lies with the MDEQ," which is the state-run environmental agency in Michigan.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that the Attorney General has filed criminal charges against some state employees for their role in this as well.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t, however, expect for the President to spend a lot of time talking about specific accountability, primarily because there continues to be ongoing investigations into that accountability, and the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be perceived as weighing in on one side or the other.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President will certainly go to Michigan and make a forceful case that as the President of the United States, he feels responsible for the safety and wellbeing of every American, no matter which community they live in.\xc2\xa0 And I think that would certainly explain the widespread federal effort in Flint to help the people of Flint deal with this emergency situation.\xc2\xa0 7.3 million liters of water have been distributed by federal employees.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 55,000 water and pitcher filters be distributed in communities there.\xc2\xa0 About a quarter of a million replacement cartridges have been passed out as well.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a significant expansion of health care access, paid for by the federal government.\xc2\xa0 This access comes both in the forms of expanding Medicaid eligibility, but also in terms of offering grants to local health care providers so that they have more resources to treat more people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is all a reflection of the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to helping the people of Flint deal with what\xe2\x80\x99s a tragic situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But one last thing.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of post-crisis, right?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the response to the crisis once it had been fully realized.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, is the President prepared to \xe2\x80\x93- he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be meeting with a group of people, I guess, around the table.\xc2\xa0 If they look at him and say, yes, obviously there were failures at the state level but where was the federal government a year ago, a year and a half ago, two years ago when this was all happening -- what does he say to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he says that the EPA takes very seriously the responsibility that they have to work effectively with state regulators to ensure the clean air and clean water of everybody in America.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why more than six weeks ago, the administrator of the EPA sent a letter to governors all across the country, making clear exactly what responsibilities state regulators have when it comes to enforcing the lead and copper rule.\xc2\xa0 She was also clear in that letter that there will be a response from the EPA if the state regulators fall down on the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that level of clarity hopefully will prevent the situation in Flint from reemerging in other communities.\xc2\xa0 And that obviously is a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tJosh.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 I just want to ask you the question:\xc2\xa0 Have you given any consideration to the thought process of Senate Republicans that you mentioned are taking some heat from their constituents on Merrick Garland and their decision to completely dismiss the nominating process rather than go ahead and at least go through the motions of the process, even if the outcome is predetermined?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here.\xc2\xa0 The reason that the leader of Republicans in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, issued a statement just hours after the announcement of Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s death is that he wanted to try to shut down the process as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 He recognized that if the President put forward a highly qualified, experienced, respectable individual with impeccable legal credentials to fill that vacancy, that there would be enormous pressure on Republicans to vote and confirm this individual.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Republicans are trying not to do.\xc2\xa0 The President effectively called their bluff by nominating someone that even Republicans have described as a consensus nominee.\xc2\xa0 Even Republicans who have met with Chief Judge Garland have had very positive things to say about his character and about his aptitude for the job.\xc2\xa0 So people like Pat Toomey said that he was "very, very smart and very knowledgeable."\xc2\xa0 Republican Senator Rob Portman from Ohio described Chief Judge Garland as \xe2\x80\x9can impressive guy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Senator Flake from Arizona described Chief Judge Garland as \xe2\x80\x9cobviously a man of accomplishment and keen intellect.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina described him as \xe2\x80\x9chonest and capable\xe2\x80\x9d and described his reputation as \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond reproach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what Republicans are trying to do is they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to prevent a situation in which Chief Judge Garland sits before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answers any questions that come his way.\xc2\xa0 We know that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a hearing like this, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be \xe2\x80\x93- it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get lots of attention.\xc2\xa0 It will be carried live on many of the networks that are represented in this room, at least for parts of the hearing.\xc2\xa0 And the expectation the President has is that Chief Judge Garland is going to use his brilliant legal mind and 19 years of judicial experience to effectively answer those questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd once that hearing is completed, you\xe2\x80\x99ll really see pressure on Republicans to explain their position, trying to block his confirmation to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 So what we have seen from Republicans, particularly Republican leaders in Washington, is to shut down this effort before it can build momentum.\xc2\xa0 But I think in spite of their efforts, we have built up some momentum and some pressure on Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I do think this is why every Republican senator across the country, including Senator Ayotte, is facing a central question:\xc2\xa0 Are they going to listen to Republican leaders in the United States Senate and not do their job?\xc2\xa0 Or are they going to do what the United States Constitution requires?\xc2\xa0 And that is to offer their advice and consent for the President\xe2\x80\x99s choice to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing the instructions of Republican leaders in Washington I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is going to be a particularly persuasive explanation for their conduct when Republican senators are facing their constituents.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, on Syria, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xc2\xa0 If safe zones or safe areas is not the purpose in Geneva, then why are negotiators there looking at maps and drawing up lines of areas where allegedly civilians and/or members of the moderate opposition could shelter?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re looking at maps.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what our people are telling us.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mark, the goal of the conversations in Geneva are to build confidence in a political transition.\xc2\xa0 And what the negotiators in Geneva on the opposition side of the table have indicated is it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for them to engage in political talks when their constituents back home are being bombed recklessly and tragically by the regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the idea behind the cessation of hostilities was to try to bring the violence between the opposition and the government to an end so that negotiations could take place.\xc2\xa0 So what the negotiators are doing is trying to find a way to get the regime to stop bombing their people so that they can try to come to some sort of political agreement.\xc2\xa0 What we found is that at least for a while, when the cessation of hostilities was initially implemented, that that actually worked out a little bit better than anybody expected.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd part of that was because the Russian government, President Putin, was willing to put his own credibility on the line and was willing to make a strong case to the Assad regime that they needed to abide by the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And we want them to just go back and do the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I get that.\xc2\xa0 But what I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is, if they\xe2\x80\x99re sitting down and drawing lines on a map and saying this area is going to be off limits, is that not a safe zone or a safe area, or propose some other way to call it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the reason that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would describe it that way is that ISIL and Nusra are not part of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the Assad regime that has signed onto the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 So I think when there was a broader discussion about safe zones and the President was asked directly in a news conference about whether or not he would support the concept of a safe zone, and the President expressed his strong opposition to it, is that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to create a situation in which the United States was on the hook for protecting that safe zone from incursions by extremists, by Nusra, by ISIL, or by the regime.\xc2\xa0 So the conversations that are taking place in Geneva right now are focused very specifically on where we can reinforce our efforts to implement successfully a cessation of hostilities, to try to lower the violence, to advance political talks, but also allow the shipment of humanitarian relief into areas that have long been caught in the crossfire.</p>\n<p>\n\tMegan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s two topics I wanted to ask about.\xc2\xa0 First, the 28 pages of classified documents in the 9/11 Commission report.\xc2\xa0 CIA Director John Brennan over the weekend saying that there could be some inaccuracies in there and some unvetted information.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about that?\xc2\xa0 And how close is the White House to releasing those documents?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I saw that there was a little attention that was generated by Director Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 I have to admit I was surprised by that attention because there was an op-ed that was written just last week by Lee Hamilton and Governor Kean from New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kean were the chair of the independent commission that took a look at the 9/11 attacks, both the events that led to the attacks but also proposed reforms that would prevent those kinds of attacks from occurring on American soil ever again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey wrote that op-ed and indicated that they also saw the 28 pages.\xc2\xa0 They described those 28 pages as unvetted, law enforcement investigative materials.\xc2\xa0 And they said they had an opportunity to review that material, to follow up on leads, and that they actually conducted interviews not just in the United States but around the world to follow up on that information.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed many times in this room over the last several weeks, the conclusion of their report is that they found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution had supported al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Director Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s comments are entirely in line with those that were put forward by Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, who had a responsibility to look at that material, to follow up on the claims, and to offer up an unclassified conclusion about what was included there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how close is the White House to releasing the documents?\xc2\xa0 And is there concern that releasing them is going to be a mistake?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The White House is not responsible for releasing the documents.\xc2\xa0 Those documents are currently in the possession of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\xc2\xa0 That is the office that is responsible for processing sensitive information that is being considered for public release.\xc2\xa0 They have a declassification process that they conduct that is part of their standard operating procedure.\xc2\xa0 I would acknowledge that they have been conducting that process on this material for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, has indicated that they are hopeful they can complete that process by the end of June.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, on Donald Trump and some comments that he made over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 He seemed to indicate that campaigning is more difficult than governing, saying, "It\'s harder to become President, in my opinion, than to do a great job at being President."\xc2\xa0 Would the President agree with that assessment?\xc2\xa0 Or do you have a comment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulianna, nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 I\'m used to you sitting one chair behind you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, me too.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So welcome back to the briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s good to be in the front row.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just going back to Saturday night, can you talk a little bit about how the cameo with former Speaker John Boehner came about in the President\'s speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s pretty simple and in some ways depicted in the video, which is that the White House called Speaker Boehner and asked him if he\'d be interested in participating in the video.\xc2\xa0 And I think as was evident from the finished product, he was an enthusiastic participant in the production.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, Speaker Boehner has a well-known and very good sense of humor.\xc2\xa0 And he made I think a very positive contribution to our comedic efforts in the film.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was it filmed?\xc2\xa0 And did they meet in addition to the taping to talk about current events, politics, Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They had an opportunity to spend time together in the context of filming the video.\xc2\xa0 There was no separate meeting.\xc2\xa0 But the video was actually just filmed on Friday, so just a few days ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did they talk about the Speaker\'s comments about Ted Cruz from the night before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There was not a detailed discussion of those comments, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, also, over the weekend, Bernie Sanders said that there was going to be a contested convention, and essentially called on Democratic super-delegates to flip to support him.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President thinks is appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President thinks is appropriate is individual candidates should make their own decisions about running their campaign. And we\'ve obviously seen a very rigorous campaign on the Democratic side, and there\'s still some contests to go and more opportunities for Democratic voters across the country to weigh in on who they believe should represent our party in the general election.\xc2\xa0 And the President thus far has refrained from weighing on that debate too much.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Flint and the governor, you mentioned that the White House has extended an invitation for him to meet the President at the airport.\xc2\xa0 Its sounds like the governor wants a lot more in terms of a substantive meeting with the President, and has requested that.\xc2\xa0 Has there been a response to that request?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t determined the President\'s schedule for his trip to Flint.\xc2\xa0 As a matter of standard operating procedure, we invited the governor to come to the airport.\xc2\xa0 So the invitation to Governor Snyder\'s office was not unique; it\'s one that\'s even been extended to him a few times before.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, does the President see the governor as someone that he thinks is important to meet and spend some time with there as a solution found to the problem?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly intends to spend quite a bit of time when he\'s in Flint talking to local residents, talking to local officials.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point exactly the extent of the conversations that the President will have with Governor Snyder, but we\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given what you were saying about how the state has been sort of blamed for all this, I was wondering how could he see the Governor as having the capacity and the credibility to be a viable partner in this whole process going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Governor Snyder, to his credit, has recognized that there is an important role for the state to play in helping the citizens of Flint recover.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously the U.S. government, the federal government, at the direction of President Obama, has been deeply involved in that recovery effort.\xc2\xa0 But state officials have been, too.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to the state officials to detail what contributions they have made to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, this is a situation that should transcend politics.\xc2\xa0 This should be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together and try to right many of the wrongs that have been sustained by the citizens of Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President have any specific priorities in terms of what he wants to see happen as a result of this visit?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s the idea of generally reassuring residents, and you delineated the list of the water.\xc2\xa0 So is there some aspect of this crisis that the President thinks should be changed, focused on, alleviated as a result of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I would not anticipate that the President will make big news by announcing a new package of relief for the city of Flint.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a significant commitment of resources to try to help the people of Flint in this urgent situation.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard me here advocate on a couple of occasions that Congress should get involved here.\xc2\xa0 Congress should mobilize some resources that could be used to address the situation in Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is the President will make a broader argument about just how important it is for government at all levels to function effectively.\xc2\xa0 That stands in pretty stark contrast to some Republican candidates who suggest that environmental agencies shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even exist.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Iraq situation, just quickly.\xc2\xa0 The Green Zone barriers were breached.\xc2\xa0 And the reporting suggested that a lot of the security forces there basically let the protesters in.\xc2\xa0 So is the United States confident that won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again?\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned about the level of security in that area?\xc2\xa0 And I know the reporting was that the embassy was never threatened, and there were false rumors about evacuations, but that aspect of the situation, you had this fortress for 12 or 13 years, and now it does not seem to be a fortress anymore.\xc2\xa0 How concerned about you about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron, the President of the United States is concerned every day about the safety and security of Americans serving our country overseas.\xc2\xa0 And that includes our diplomats.\xc2\xa0 That is always a top priority and at the top of the list when it comes to making decisions about U.S. policy in countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, in the immediate aftermath of the ISIL advance across Iraq in 2014, the President\xe2\x80\x99s primary concern was about the safety of American diplomats and American personnel in Erbil and in Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 And the initial military response that President Obama mobilized was to safeguard those American citizens.\xc2\xa0 So this is always a top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that the U.S. has received assurances from Iraqi officials that they understand their obligations to protect diplomatic facilities.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly take them at their word.\xc2\xa0 But look, we\'re going to continue to closely monitor the situation because the safety and security of our personnel is always the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it true that the security guards essentially let the protesters in, didn\'t stop them?\xc2\xa0 That\'s got to be worrying.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty chaotic situation there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anybody knows exactly what happened on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But look, we\'re always interested in understanding how developments on the ground could have an impact on the safety and security of American citizens who are serving over in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to continue to monitor the situation closely as a result.\xc2\xa0 And we have received assurances from the Iraqi government and from Iraqi security forces that they\'re prepared to live up to their international obligations to protect diplomats that are serving in Baghdad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been some contemplation of increasing the security posture at the U.S. embassy or inside the Green Zone as a result of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Decisions that are made specifically about enhancing the security around any particular diplomatic facility would be made over at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we\'re continuing to closely watch the situation.\xc2\xa0 And if the security experts determine that additional security is needed, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure they have the resources necessary to make those changes.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to take you back to the 28 pages.\xc2\xa0 And based on your earlier comments, you\'re generally aware of what Director Brennan said, using words like, inaccurate, uncorroborated, and unvetted -- echoing the column that we saw in USA Today.\xc2\xa0 Does the President concur with that assessment, that analysis of what\xe2\x80\x99s in those 28 pages?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, the President has not read the 28 pages.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed on their contents.\xc2\xa0 And look, I think you can reliably assume that based on the comments both of Director Brennan and Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, who don\'t serve in the Obama administration, that what both of them have described is an accurate understanding of the contents of those 28 pages.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then based on that, does the President feel like the DNI needs to move forward with its review?\xc2\xa0 It\'s been more than 14 years -- and you have I have talked about this -- it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like there\'s any reason not to release it, based on the fact that you said a number of people have looked at this and there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be anything that would affect national security.\xc2\xa0 Maybe a little embarrassing perhaps on some circumstances.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\'s preliminary information.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not hard-and-fast stuff.\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying that this is partial information.\xc2\xa0 And why not just release it so the American people --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to defer to the experts who have a day-to-day responsibility for determining what sensitive national security information can be released to the public without having a negative impact on our interests or our ability to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that is what should drive the decision.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is that our intelligence officials have indicated that they expect to complete that process by the end of June.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll look forward to their decision at that point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last nugget on that one.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason why the President would not have read those pages?\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said previously he was generally aware, and then you said he\'s been briefed on them.\xc2\xa0 Why not read them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President obviously reads a lot of material on a day-to-day basis.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not sure that he felt it was necessary for him to read those 28 pages.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s not opposed to reading it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten around to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last, I want to ask you about the cruise from Miami to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 An historic day not just in South Florida but obviously over on the island.\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts or comments on that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the latest reports on this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the goal of the President\'s policy changes towards Cuba was motivated by a desire to begin to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba, because the President\'s assumption is that for 50 years we tried to isolate the Cuban government in the hopes that that would apply pressure to them to do a better job of respecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 That didn\xe2\x80\x99t work for five decade.\xc2\xa0 That policy of isolation was carried out with little tangible impact.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President decided that we needed to try a different strategy, and that that this strategy would be focused on engagement -- engagement between the Cuban people and American citizens; engagement between the Cuban government and the U.S. government; engagement between Cuban businesses and American businesses -- and that by establishing those deeper ties, we would be able to better advance our interests and our values.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd look, this is a policy change that\'s only been in place for a little over a year at this point.\xc2\xa0 But look, I think we\'re optimistic about the progress that we have made thus far.\xc2\xa0 There certainly is a lot more work to be done, and there\'s certainly a number of additional reforms we\'d like to see the Cuban government undertake.\xc2\xa0 But I think it would be hard to deny that this policy change hasn\xe2\x80\x99t benefitted the American people.\xc2\xa0 And look, I think the best proof point for that is to go and ask my counterparts at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau, and other traditionally Republican-supporting institutions that have been strongly supportive of this President\'s change of policy towards Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Will we be getting the drone civilian casualty report before the anniversary of the NDU speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Olivier, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on the timing of that report.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President\'s top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, delivered a speech six weeks or so ago now, indicating that we were prepared to begin releasing additional material about the results of counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of timing, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President believe that Japan deserves a formal U.S. government apology for the bombing of Hiroshima?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, he does not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last one.\xc2\xa0 Just to button up April\'s line of questioning -- because we\'re being asked -- how much visibility did the White House have into what Mr. Wilmore was going to say on Saturday night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 None.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So wait, just to further clarify that clarification -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Could I possibly be clearer than none?\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 Occupational hazard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Wilmore\'s team didn\xe2\x80\x99t run by the possibility that he would throw in the N-word at the end of his spiel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The White House staff did not vet the President\'s remarks with Mr. Wilmore.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Wilmore did not vet his remarks with the White House staff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And based on what you were saying before, are you saying that the President was not bothered at all by the use of that word?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that the President appreciated the sentiment that Mr. Wilmore expressed in his speech.\xc2\xa0 And I think any fair reading of the last three paragraphs of that speech I think make clear that the personal views that Mr. Wilmore was expressing came from a genuine place.\xc2\xa0 And he expressed his -- he said at the end --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that a copy they gave you before to vet?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 At the risk of free publicity, this is the blogpost from Jonathan Capehart at The Washington Post.\xc2\xa0 But in here he included the end of Mr. Wilmore\'s remarks, and he said -- this is Mr. Wilmore here -- he said, "A black man was thought by his mere color not good enough to lead a football team.\xc2\xa0 And now to live in your time, Mr. President, when a black man can lead the free world, words alone do me no justice."\xc2\xa0 That is an authentic expression of his personal viewpoint, and it\'s an authentic expression of his appreciation for the President of the United States, but also for the capacity of this country to change.\xc2\xa0 And the President has observed that progress on a number of occasions, and Mr. Wilmore was doing the same.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really expect to be on this subject so soon, but while we\'re on it -- some of the jokes that the President made about Hillary Clinton kind of got a mixed reaction.\xc2\xa0 Some people think that they were harsher than expected.\xc2\xa0 Did he have a conversation with Clinton, either before or after the dinner, on the subject?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He did not.\xc2\xa0 But it appears that that conversation was not necessary, because I did see the Tweet from Secretary Clinton indicating her approval for those comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t reach out to her, either before or after, to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, he did not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, one of President Obama\'s more cutting jokes was at CNN.\xc2\xa0 So was he saying that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t tell me you guys got all sensitive.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\'s all in good fun.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that CNN has a problem journalistically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think that Hillary Clinton is the presumptive next President of the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President obviously had an apt joke about turning over the podium at the White House Correspondents\' Dinner to the next President, no matter who she is.\xc2\xa0 Again, look the President was making a joke and acknowledging that there are a number of votes that remain to be cast before the American people have decided who will assume the awesome responsibility of addressing the White House Correspondents\' Dinner next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the subject -- back to the 28 pages.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Nakamura did not like my joke.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a reason that I will not be assuming the podium at the White House Correspondents\' Dinner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'ve been through this, and the President had an opportunity to just recently sit down with the Saudis on this.\xc2\xa0 But given the reaction that could come after the release of those pages, is there any expectation that this will affect the relationship with the Saudis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to anticipate exactly what the reaction will be if that decision is made.\xc2\xa0 So I sort of hesitate to hazard a guess that\'s rooted in a hypothetical here.\xc2\xa0 But the one thing I think I would point out is simply that the President did have an opportunity to meet with King Salman for about two hours in Riyadh shortly after we arrived in Saudi Arabia a week ago last Wednesday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey met for two hours, and this question about the 28 pages did not come up in their meeting.\xc2\xa0 I assure you they covered a wide variety of topics, but this was not one of them.\xc2\xa0 So I think that would be at least one indication that this is not an issue that rates at the same level of some of the other challenges that are plaguing the Middle East right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s been months now since the President put forward Garland as the nominee.\xc2\xa0 And given that public pressure is something that you\'re going for -- either to change minds now, or change voters\xe2\x80\x99 minds later -- but given that at this point, with the public pressure that you\'ve tried to apply, that outside groups have tried to apply, do you feel like the public outrage isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily there when you see that very few Republican senators\xe2\x80\x99 minds have changed at this point?\xc2\xa0 And does that tell you that possibly the public outrage won\xe2\x80\x99t be there to change anything at the polls, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'re not seeking to provoke public outrage.\xc2\xa0 We want to have a discussion about whether or not Republicans in the Senate are prepared to do their job.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are plenty of candidates out there that may be trying to stoke that outrage to achieve a political aim of one form or another.\xc2\xa0 I think the President would observe that\'s precisely the problem.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus a little less on provoking public outrage and a little more on doing your job.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what Republicans, and particularly Republicans in the Senate have refused to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but some of the words and phrases you\'ve used to describe what Republicans are doing are pretty harsh.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that no -- if you\'re going for public pressure, the fact that no Republican minds have changed at this point, does that tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s not working?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think a lot of Republican minds across the country have concluded that Republican senators who are refusing to do their job just because Mitch McConnell asked them to I think is an indication that we are making some progress.\xc2\xa0 There are at least two Republican senators that have come out in support of Chief Judge Garland getting a hearing and a vote.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s at least one high-profile Senate candidate in the state of Florida that has come out and indicated that Chief Judge Garland deserves a vote.\xc2\xa0 There are some former Republican senators -- people like Dick Lugar and Tom Coburn -- who have come out and indicated that they believe that Chief Judge Garland deserves a hearing and a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t know if those people changed their minds, or if this is the view that they had all along.\xc2\xa0 But there is plenty of evidence to indicate that there are plenty of Republicans who agree with the case that President Obama has made, which is that Republicans should not for the first time since 1875 deny a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote.\xc2\xa0 That would be an unprecedented escalation of partisan politics into a Supreme Court process that has historically been shielded from a lot of partisan stray voltage.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, there have been politics that have polluted this process in the past.\xc2\xa0 The President has acknowledged that there\xe2\x80\x99s no one party that is responsible for that.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying that it is Republicans in this instance that they\'re escalating this partisanship in a way that\'s not good for the country.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly is not fair to a distinguished public servant like Chief Judge Garland who has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration still think that this is going to go to a vote -- to hearings and a vote, ultimately?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I have refrained from predicting legislative outcomes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No -- Denis McDonough, maybe a month and a half ago, said that he believed that this would go there, and then you agreed, and you felt that that\'s -- do you still feel that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I still feel that that\'s exactly what should happen.\xc2\xa0 And we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be making this case, and the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be devoting about an hour of his afternoon to talking to local television anchors if we didn\'t think this is something that can and should be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple more on Hiroshima.\xc2\xa0 We\'re about less than three weeks before the President leaves for Asia.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can provide an update as to whether the President will visit Hiroshima.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Japan at this point.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re obviously hard at work planning that trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you rule it out?\xc2\xa0 We\'re less than three weeks from the trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I cannot --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- added a potential stop --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t rule it out at this point.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary for this trip to Japan is not yet set.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys are actively considering it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ve actively considered it every time the President has decided to travel to Japan.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been there, what, three or four times now, Mark, as President?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t mean to put you on the spot there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The President has been to Japan three or four times as President. \xc2\xa0And each time the President has traveled there, this question has come up and we\'ve considered it each time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken directly with Secretary Kerry about the merits of a visit to Hiroshima after his trip?\xc2\xa0 Or has the President reached out to his ambassador, Caroline Kennedy, about what she thinks about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly Ambassador Kennedy and her office have been involved in planning our trip.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether or not the President has had a specific conversation with Secretary Kerry since he returned from his trip to Hiroshima just a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that we\'re considering.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, we\'re not considering it for the first time.\xc2\xa0 This is something that -- this is a question that has come up every time the President has planned to travel to Japan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Final thing on that.\xc2\xa0 There have been a number of op-eds written since Secretary Kerry visited -- from The New York Times and The Washington Post -- that were in favor; the Weekly Standard and others I think were against it.\xc2\xa0 But Wendy Sherman I think had an op-ed encouraging the President to go -- published by CNN -- a former high-ranking State Department official familiar with nuclear issues.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is monitoring that coverage on how the administration overall, the West Wing feels about sort of the reaction on net to John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s visit and these calls for the President to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President has read each of the materials that you\'ve just described.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly aware of the public debate that consideration of a visit like this has prompted.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s entirely appropriate.\xc2\xa0 But until we make -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard to talk about until we\'ve made a decision one way or the other.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know on net that the general sentiment favors -- is supporting a trip, whether you go or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell at this point.\xc2\xa0 But I think once we\'ve made a decision, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared to explain how we arrived at that decision once we\'ve announced it.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 On the President today engaging in media interviews to encourage Senate action on Judge Garland, there\xe2\x80\x99s another nominee the full Senate hasn\xe2\x80\x99t acted on since he was named by the President nearly six months ago -- Eric Fanning for Army Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Will the President employ the same effort to get him confirmed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President certainly will continue to make clear that he believes that Mr. Fanning would serve with distinction as Secretary of the Army.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Fanning is somebody that has extensive experience at the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s served in a number of roles there.\xc2\xa0 And he would bring that experience and that judgement to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that he is exactly the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionable for Republicans to continue to block his nomination for no good reason.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week, Senator McCain attempted to get a vote on the nominee, but he was blocked by Senator Roberts, who has placed a hold on the nomination.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House strategy for convincing Senator Roberts to lift the hold on Fanning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the White House has made a strong and effective case to Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that Mr. Fanning deserves confirmation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make that argument on the merits to everyone who continues to try to block his nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Roberts mentioned on the floor a phone call he received from the White House on the nomination.\xc2\xa0 What did that consist of?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not privy to that phone call.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t confirm that it occurred.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to continue to make a strong case on the merits that our national security would be enhanced by the Senate confirming the Secretary of the Army, particularly when it\xe2\x80\x99s somebody as distinguished as Mr. Fanning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given Senator Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s voting record, and the fact that Eric Fanning would be the first openly gay person to serve as Army Secretary, do you think sexual orientation is a factor on this hold?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea what the motivations are of Republicans to unfairly block the nomination of a patriotic American to this critical national security post.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s public record that Senator Roberts voted against "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" repeal; against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act; in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage nationwide.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t that raise questions about the motivations behind this hold?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea what his motivations are.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that his actions, though, are wrong.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Fanning is a distinguished public servant.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a patriotic American.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been nominated by the President of the United States to a critically important job.\xc2\xa0 And the Senate should stop obstructing that nomination.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, I put you on the spot earlier, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about the five hours that the President spent yesterday with the Obama Foundation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not much.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President was visiting with architects who had submitted designs related to his presidential library.\xc2\xa0 But this is a process that\'s been administered by the foundation.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for specific questions about that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did he leave the White House for that meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is that there is an opportunity to make these presentations.\xc2\xa0 And it was concluded that for logistical reasons it would be easier to convene that series of meetings offsite.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he doing fundraising?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no, he was not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he started doing fundraising?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He has not.\xc2\xa0 He has not.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be raising money for the foundation until after he leaves office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House upset about China\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to let the Stennis carrier group have a port visit in Hong Kong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding -- you should check with the Department of Defense on this -- I know that even as the Chinese made that announcement, there actually was a U.S. naval vessel that had made a port of call in Hong Kong.\xc2\xa0 So it does not appear to be a significant change in policy that they\'re administering.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the Stennis carrier group has made a port of call in Hong Kong before.\xc2\xa0 But I can\'t speak to what the Chinese government may have had in mind by denying this request.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:10 P.M.
