GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 You know what -- I forgot the week ahead, so we will email that around at the conclusion of today\xe2\x80\x99s activities.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 We reported last night that Robert Gates has told the President that he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay on for at least another year.\xc2\xa0 Will you give us some of the back story on that?\xc2\xa0 When and where did they have this talk?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look up the exact date, but several weeks ago the President and the Secretary of Defense had a conversation about this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President is deeply grateful for the continued service that Secretary Gates provides the Pentagon, our men and women in uniform, and the entire country, and was glad that he is staying on the helm at the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but was there any sense that the Secretary might have been thinking about leaving?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not anymore.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Robert you are confirming he\xe2\x80\x99s staying on for at least another year, is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they have confirmed he\xe2\x80\x99s staying on, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t -- I will also confirm, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions for you on the economy.\xc2\xa0 The announcement this afternoon has to do again with money from the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see a need for new money to boost the economy this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is the award recipients for tax incentives for the creation of renewable manufacturing jobs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a, I think, a $2.3 billion program in the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also an example of something the President believes we should do more of.\xc2\xa0 The number of applicants for the money we have was roughly three to one.\xc2\xa0 In the speech to -- in the speech on jobs at the Brookings Institution in December, the President actually called for increasing this type of investment in the private sector to create that environment for additional hiring by an additional $5 billion.</p>\n<p>So the President believes that there are things that have worked and are working well -- targeted money that should be increased, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But throwing it forward, again, past the Recovery Act that was passed last year, is there any this year for additional spending to boost the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we throw it forward or remind you backwards, but, again, in December the President outlined some very specific examples of exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see -- today\xe2\x80\x99s program being one of those examples; investment in small businesses for additional hiring; infrastructure spending; things like that.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President has been quite clear on that.</p>\n<p>Look, we have -- today\xe2\x80\x99s jobs report is obviously disappointing:\xc2\xa0 85,000 people last month lost their jobs.\xc2\xa0 We are in a very tough economic environment.\xc2\xa0 Since this recession officially began more than two years ago, 7 million jobs have been lost.\xc2\xa0 I honestly doubt, Jeff, that had a report showed 40,000 -- or 20,000 or so jobs created, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that the President would say, well, what I thought we should do in December is now wiped away because of the jobs report.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long way to go, and as we talked about this last month, and I think if you look back as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it each month, we knew this was going to be a long road.\xc2\xa0 And we knew that along that road there would be ups and downs and bumps along the way.</p>\n<p>I think if you look through and analyze some of the numbers, there are some bright spots which I think are at least encouraging, understanding that there are, as I said, millions of people that have lost their jobs and are hurting.\xc2\xa0 If you take the average of what we were losing in the first quarter of 2009 -- January, February, March -- we were losing on average in those months 691,000 jobs a month.</p>\n<p>If you take the average of what we\xe2\x80\x99re losing the last three months of the year -- October, November and December -- that number is 69,000, one-tenth of that job loss.\xc2\xa0 So that trend obviously is moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p>But, again, if that number was above the ledger on the positive side, I doubt you\xe2\x80\x99d find anybody in this administration, because I doubt you\xe2\x80\x99d find anybody in this country that believed our economic problems have vanished.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of trends, is the President worried about gasoline getting close to $3 a gallon and how that will affect the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, anything that is perceived or believed that will do damage to our economy or choke off some positive trends in economic recovery would be concerning to the President.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Economists like Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman say that they\xe2\x80\x99re worried there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be -- the economy is going to contract in the second half.\xc2\xa0 How worried is President Obama about his double-dip recession?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, again, I think I would say the President is worried about today and worried about the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say the President is -- wakes up concerned every day about where this economy is, understands that millions are hurting whether they are in last month\xe2\x80\x99s job losses or the job losses stretching past those two years since this recession officially began.</p>\n<p>But understand, Jake, people were hurting long before a board said there was a recession in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But obviously you plan differently if you expect a -- you know, another contraction of the economy coming up, as opposed to the line that we\xe2\x80\x99re on right now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I also think that the President -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you back to what the President talked about in December, in not being satisfied with where we were and wanting to change the direction of that line.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he is preparing as if there is going to be a contraction, he is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not an economic prognosticator.\xc2\xa0 The President is concerned about the economy, concerned about the stories of people hurting that he has heard for many, many years, and is working to do all that we can to create an environment for businesses, small and large, to hire more people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration this week announced that it was going to temporarily, at least -- or for the time being -- suspend the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Yemen.\xc2\xa0 You did transfer six in December.\xc2\xa0 Are you -- do you know where those six are?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into -- I think Christi asked these questions the other day, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into discussing transfers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well -- okay.\xc2\xa0 Given the need to talk to Congress and get them onboard with the transfer of prisoners to the Thomson correctional center, you need to convert that prison from a maximum-security prison to a supermax.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any realistic time table as to when you think Guantanamo can actually be closed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Christi also asked that question.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a time table answer.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with Congress in the upcoming session on many of the things that you talked about -- not just retrofitting, but purchasing a prison in Thomson, as well as other issues relating to the movement of prisoners from Guantanamo to Thomson.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and one last question, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 In recent days, Qais Khazaali, who was a member of -- the leader of the League of the Righteous in Iraq -- he was arrested by U.S. forces in 2007; he was responsible for an attack in Karbala that killed five U.S. soldiers.\xc2\xa0 In recent days the U.S. military has turned him over to the Iraqis and the Iraqis have freed him as part of the reconciliation going on there.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let me ask somebody to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All this is from the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask -- let me get some information on that case.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything in front of me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just a general question, is it appropriate for the U.S. military to turn --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let me -- other than what you\xe2\x80\x99ve told me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not overly familiar with the details of the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as a general principle, should --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to generalize about something with which you\xe2\x80\x99ve just asked me with great specificity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I wanted to ask you about Secretary Geithner.\xc2\xa0 Republicans on the Hill are saying they\xe2\x80\x99ve found some evidence suggesting that under his leadership the New York Fed pressured AIG to conceal information about billions of dollars of the counterparty payments that were made with taxpayer money, and they\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that he was hiding information from regulators.\xc2\xa0 I wonder, does the White House believe that Secretary Geithner should testify on the Hill, turn over any documents he has, to sort of clear this up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve already talked to them.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner was not involved in any of these emails.\xc2\xa0 These decisions did not rise to his level at the Fed.\xc2\xa0 These are emails and decisions made by officials at an independent regulatory agency --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how do you know that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t involved?\xc2\xa0 He was the leader of the New York Fed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the emails that have been talked about and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t party to the decision that was being made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Republican Congressman Issa says there are probably thousands of more emails and he may not be on some that some people have looked at.\xc2\xa0 In the interest of transparency would the White House want more -- I mean, you run AIG now, essentially --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the Department of Treasury, which I think will tell you that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what does the White House believe?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just gave you what the White House believes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, you gave me the Treasury Department -- no, what do you believe?\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that more emails should come out so we can learn --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I said was I\xe2\x80\x99m -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the story is about the emails.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that there are not emails that involve Secretary Geithner in this instance.\xc2\xa0 This is emails and decisions that are being made by two people.\xc2\xa0 That decision did not rise to his level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last thing on this.\xc2\xa0 Various liberals have jumped on this and other stories about Secretary Geithner, to say that he really is not fit to serve as Treasury Secretary.\xc2\xa0 He still has the President\xe2\x80\x99s full confidence?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of course.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, at today\xe2\x80\x99s 2:40 p.m. event will he be dealing only with the jobs issue and the clean jobs issue, or might he also talk about the Christmas Day incident?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As far as I know the last time I saw the remarks it was just on jobs and the energy announcement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has spoken quite a bit on the Christmas Day incident but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t opened himself up to questions from the media.\xc2\xa0 Do you think he might entertain some questions on that --<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and isn\xe2\x80\x99t it unusual that on an event this big that he would not open himself up to questions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not taking questions today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Mr. Knoller, I think, will back me up on this.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a press conference since July at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we get him to respond to questions rather than just give statements on issues like this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We did this before.\xc2\xa0 I think the last time we did -- we talked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s media schedule, and here you all, to a person, reminded me of our dramatic overexposure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that way.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that was then.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate at least that we\xe2\x80\x99ve isolated the flip-flop, and now we can just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans for a press conference?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask one substantive question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can you just -- would you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to answer this one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Will the transcript just point out that Mr. Reid added that he was now going to change to a substantive question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was a procedural question, which is also important, but it\xe2\x80\x99s different from substantive.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a legal thing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Make sure the transcript underlines it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a legal thing.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Mullen in a speech yesterday said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked with regard to Iran, we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked to do all we can to ensure that conflict doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break out there, while at the same time preparing forces as we do for many contingencies that we understand might occur.\xc2\xa0 Is that preparation of forces with regard to Iran per a direct presidential order, or just something the Pentagon does?\xc2\xa0 And part two, are there also preparations of forces with regard to Yemen as a contingency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to his spokesperson at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 Chip, I believe the Pentagon, as it should, plans for many different types of contingencies based on many, many different types of scenarios.\xc2\xa0 The track that the President has aggressively pursued in relating to Iran deals with engagement in hopes that they will live up to the obligations internationally that they\xe2\x80\x99ve signed on to be responsible for.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through in here our asking them through the IAEA about the research reactor and making a proposal that would prove to the world that their intentions were peaceful.\xc2\xa0 They declined that offer, and we are, as we discussed in the past many days, working with our partners on next steps in not living up those responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we assume there are these kinds of contingency plans regarding forces with Yemen, too?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into discussing details of the Pentagon plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the past several weeks, even months, a number of administration officials have said that they expect positive net job growth within the first quarter of this year.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House still believe there will be positive net job growth in the first quarter of this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe if you look at numbers in terms of weekly unemployment claims, if you look at the trajectory, you will -- lead you to believe that we will see that positive economic job growth, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a follow on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, Mr. Brennan was on "Meet the Press" and he said of the seven Yemenis who were repatriated back to Yemen from Guantanamo, six are in the custody of the Yemeni system; I assume that they are essentially in jail in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 But given the fact that one of the reasons that the President has stated that he wants to close Guantanamo is because it\xe2\x80\x99s been a black eye on this country, the non-humane treatment that the administration has alleged has taken place there, are there any guarantees that the Yemeni government is going to treat these prisoners up to the standards that the Obama administration thinks that prisoners should be treated?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have not discussed in here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to start today, the terms of transfers to home governments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is being accomplished by sending them back to Yemen if there are no guarantees that they were going to be treated up to the standards that the United States believe --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a public back and forth on something that we\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to discuss.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it was Mr. Brennan himself who said that they were in the custody of the Yemeni government.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you back to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that still true, Robert --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I told Christi this the other day, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get into that here.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President and certainly a lot of Democrats on Capitol Hill had hoped to be talking almost exclusively about the jobs and the economy I think in the first part of this year.\xc2\xa0 And do you believe that the focus on terrorism has somehow clouded or derailed that effort?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us a little peek at what might be coming up maybe next week or the next few weeks to try to focus Washington\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the jobs issue?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jonathan, I think Washington\xe2\x80\x99s attention is focused on jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think Washington\xe2\x80\x99s attention is focused on our security situation.\xc2\xa0 In all honesty, Jonathan, each day Washington has to be focused on many different things.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say if there were just one problem to focus on, maybe that would be nice, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not what he ever assumed would happen, given the type of environment that we had coming into office.\xc2\xa0 I doubt there will ever be a day in which we\xe2\x80\x99re only focusing on one issue.</p>\n<p>The President -- I think each day that he has spent this year -- has worked on a multitude of issues, ranging from getting our economy back in order, finishing up health care, working on the security situation and the investigation that was -- that he spoke about yesterday -- Afghanistan, Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s honestly no end to the number of issues that I think he\xe2\x80\x99s probably spent time working on over the past eight days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve announced the trip to Lorain, Ohio -- Lorain County.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else that you could talk about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get -- I walked out of there without having a week ahead, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get some more information on upcoming economic events.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the matter involving the advertising billboard been resolved?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office spoke with the company and that the company is supposed to take that ad down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyone offer you a billboard to endorse any product?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I better not make any jacket jokes here or -- the boss might be watching.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday John Brennan said that he felt he let the President down.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel he was let down?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- I think John was speaking not just for himself, but I think John was speaking for all of those that had been represented in that Situation Room meeting on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 And the President heard from each of them accepting responsibility for their part of what went wrong.</p>\n<p>I think, as the President has talked about this and as the report describes it, there was a systemic failure, a failure that went across agencies and departments, that no one person and no one agency or department was fully and wholly to blame.</p>\n<p>I think the President is focused on, and certainly John is, on identifying what went wrong and how to fix it.\xc2\xa0 That will certainly be John\xe2\x80\x99s charge moving forward, as you heard the President discuss hearing back from him in 30 days about our progress on filling those gaps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said yesterday we\xe2\x80\x99re in a war with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Does he regard the attempt on Flight 253 to be an act of war?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- the White House certainly said quite quickly after the incident that it was a terrorist incident.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you back to what the President said in the fourth paragraph of his inaugural address about our nation being at war with al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it just raises the question again of whether Abdulmutallab is prosecuted as an enemy combatant or as a criminal.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s been indicted in the -- in our criminal justice system, after being interrogated extensively by the FBI in which, as we discussed earlier, he gave the FBI useful information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one more on Mr. Geithner.\xc2\xa0 Barney Frank says that he thinks there should be hearings held on, if nothing else than to clear the air.\xc2\xa0 So wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be useful for Mr. Geithner to come up and tell the Hill what he knew and when he knew --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if Mr. Frank schedules a hearing for Secretary Geithner -- when the Financial Services Committee generally has hearings with the Treasury Secretary, he goes to those hearings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 State of the Union -- this month or next month?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This month?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this month still in the running?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up here, Robert?\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s intention and/or hope to hold off the State of the Union until there\xe2\x80\x99s a health care deal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is getting fun.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about "Lost" issue?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You a big fan?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99ll announce something soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions, you might expect.\xc2\xa0 The labor leaders are coming to meet with the President on Monday to talk about health care.\xc2\xa0 At that meeting with the President will [he] try to make them understand that the taxing mechanism with the Senate bill is a better idea than they think it is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would be surprised if the topic didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be true.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s orientation, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of the meeting, and what does he hope to gain out of it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think the President will take the opportunity to discuss that issue with them.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that is a difference in the legislation that the House and the Senate passed.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will talk through with them what he believes can be gotten out of that provision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he ask them specifically not to advocate against it, as some labor unions are now either doing or actively considering at the grassroots level?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President looks forward to having a discussion with them on the merits of that proposal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very good.\xc2\xa0 On Yemen, what is the U.S. position on what role Anwar al-Awlaki plays in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?\xc2\xa0 Is he someone that we want to arrest, capture, kill?\xc2\xa0 Do we believe he\xe2\x80\x99s a central figure either operationally or rhetorically in leading those who want to do harm to the United States to actually be successful?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get some intelligence guidance.\xc2\xa0 I have an answer, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can discuss it publicly; happy to discuss it afterwards.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the type of hate that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and I think what John discussed yesterday, the motivation and the perversion of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 This man is somebody who has sought over the Internet to spread that sort of hate and perversion, and obviously to do harm in spreading that hate.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he is somebody of great concern.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what degree is your evaluation and perhaps your ability to talk about it complicated by the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s an American citizen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated by intelligence matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very good.\xc2\xa0 On -- that\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the disappointing jobs report, is the administration giving any consideration to kind of a public service jobs program or any other vehicle for directly hiring people through the government?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s even on the drawing board anywhere in the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard -- not heard a discussion on that.\xc2\xa0 I think, Michael, the President and the administration would tell you that what we believe we can do through both the Recovery Act and through additional targeted investments, as the President spoke about in December, is to create an environment where the private sector is hiring again.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- truthfully don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a solution that only includes one sector, in all honesty.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s just one way to -- or one positive thing that will solve the entire problem.\xc2\xa0 Obviously over the course of the two years, the 24 months of jobs numbers that have been released since the official beginning of that recession were in excess of 7 million jobs having been lost.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long road to hoe in making up for that.</p>\n<p>Again, I think one of the -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to not simply what the President is doing but in asking that that be expanded, because there is a tremendous demand for these type of tax credits, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a program that is dramatically oversubscribed, to use a term, in those that are seeking that assistance and help.\xc2\xa0 And as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President discuss, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to lay a new foundation for creating jobs going forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to depend on -- simply on consumer spending or simply on a housing bubble to fuel economic growth going forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find and invest in new ideas and new industries.</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that for quite some time, when it came to building the solar panels and the wind towers and the wind turbines and a lot of the manufactured equipment for clean energy, we had a number of foreign countries that were doing much better in addressing that demand than we were.\xc2\xa0 And as the President has said often, the type of demand for these components in manufacturing is only going to increase as we seek solutions to our energy problems.</p>\n<p>And we have to ask ourselves as a country, are we going to create those jobs and create those components, or are we going to import those components from overseas?\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have an opportunity to lead the world in this type of manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, many civil rights groups and others say that even if successful, such programs won\xe2\x80\x99t address the most distressed communities in this country.\xc2\xa0 Does the President disagree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s been asked this direct question about this scenario, and gave largely the answer that I just gave, which is if we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- if we don\xe2\x80\x99t seek to fill these jobs and fill this demand, somebody else will, somebody in another country.\xc2\xa0 We have to bore down and make sure that this investment is a priority for us to create those jobs now.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard over the last several days people like Mr. Brennan saying that he let the President down, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard sort of a recitation of failures.\xc2\xa0 What has the President himself, though, learned from this, and how does he plan to operate differently, given the new threats and the new information that he\xe2\x80\x99s learned?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I think that first and foremost, I\xe2\x80\x99d go back to John and throughout the intelligence community -- I think the President wants to ensure that first and foremost what we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified through our review is addressed.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the President -- the President is very serious about ensuring that what has been identified as a shortcoming is addressed quickly and done fully and thoroughly; doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want this review to be something that lays around on somebody\xe2\x80\x99s desk and that people don\xe2\x80\x99t appropriately take as important as he does.</p>\n<p>I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say -- and certainly I heard him say in the Situation Room that the level of our failure was unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 As he said, were it not for brave citizens of the world on that plane, it might have been a catastrophic disaster.\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the system that prevented that, it was brave citizens.</p>\n<p>So I think the President is going to ensure that John and others are fulfilling what these reviews have shown are the gaps in our system that have to be fixed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how will they do that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he going to have more meetings with Mr. Brennan?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to change how he\xe2\x80\x99s briefed every day?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be briefed earlier in the day?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any change in his briefing schedule.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously John and everybody else understand the seriousness of the task that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been undertaking for the last almost, I guess, two weeks, and are serious -- the President is serious that it has to be fixed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just following up on John saying he let the President down, and frankly the going around the room that you described the situation, did anybody offer to resign?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Either there or any place else?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of anywhere else; certainly not in the Situation Room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since there\xe2\x80\x99s no constitutional requirement that the President go to Capitol Hill and deliver a State of the Union address in the third week of January, the first week of February, are there any legislative issue considerations guiding when he wants to do it this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 None?\xc2\xa0 And secondarily, is he aware of the Internet storm over those who are begging him not to schedule the State of the Union address on the night of the three-hour premiere of "Lost"?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this on behalf of ABC Radio.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t foresee a scenario in which the millions of people that hope to finally get some conclusion in "Lost" are preempted by the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can quote a senior administration official.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, without going into the specifics of the week ahead, is there going to be an economic or sort of job theme at the President\xe2\x80\x99s public events to communicate that concern --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it in front of me and I -- but, yes, there will be over the course of the next several weeks -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think just next week, but over the course of the next several weeks, as Jonathan said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced a visit to Ohio specifically to build off of what he\xe2\x80\x99d done in Allentown in December, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do again.\xc2\xa0 And there will be several events over the next few weeks on that topic.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do all of the transferees --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, just one -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve now realized the -- both the coat and the color of your sweater are of some import and significance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I was going to be classy and not even bring it up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Hard not to notice the Bear Bryant -- congratulations to your Crimson Tide.\xc2\xa0 I did get a few emails from friends wondering if I would mention my excitement at the newly crowned national champions.\xc2\xa0 So consider that having checked that box.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the schedule include a visit by Coach --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think sometime before the end of our first term.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have no idea what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking in Alabama football code.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question for a minute.\xc2\xa0 Do all of the transferees out of Guantanamo need to be detained by foreign authorities, or is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that, without getting into the details, there are arrangements made with countries that you transfer to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the U.S. -- is there a mechanism for monitoring where those people are?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into right here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what can you tell us about the meeting with President Clinton?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not talk to the -- I did not talk to President Obama after the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I know that he was in town, unfortunately for a funeral, and had a chance to come by and see both the President and the Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout, though, on what they spoke about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why not?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Just two questions.\xc2\xa0 Considering -- considering the continuing reports of record worldwide cold, how does the President believe that there was justification for the millions spent on that conference to try to promote acceptance of global warming?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think one only has to step outside here or visit where I used to work in Chicago to understand that climate change is -- and the record temperatures that climate change is likely causing is with us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 While he was in Hawaii, did the President visit the hospital where he was reportedly born, which is which one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I saw any pool reports of hospital visits.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you attribute today\xe2\x80\x99s weather to climate change?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what specifically causes today\xe2\x80\x99s snowfall --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or the cold that\xe2\x80\x99s gripping the nation you attribute --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that there are, even in places that are used to getting very cold weather, record cold.\xc2\xa0 I think scientists will tell you that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in and around this country or throughout the world that our weather patterns have been affected by our change in our climate, yes.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times and The Washington Post have both editorialized about a bill in Uganda that would impose a death penalty for certain acts of homosexuality.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times suggested that the U.S. should stop funding to Uganda if the bill becomes law, as some other countries have already done.\xc2\xa0 If the law passes in Uganda, will the administration continue to send foreign aid to a country that sanctions the murder of people who are gay?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on, prospectively, in the event that something like that passes, I would say that that type of -- that type of legislation would certainly not live up to any record of universal rights and universal values that I think anybody would see in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, yesterday the President spoke about the need to move beyond partisanship to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 This morning former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani criticized the White House for two things.\xc2\xa0 One was the closure of Gitmo, and the second one was the decision to put this detained terrorist in the criminal justice system.\xc2\xa0 Is that fair criticism?\xc2\xa0 Is that partisanship or citizenship?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think if one looks at what Mayor Giuliani said after testifying in the criminal -- U.S. criminal trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, calling it -- I forget the exact phrase -- but holding up the stellar record of, and the value system involved in our criminal justice system, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Mr. Giuliani has the record straight in his comments as it relates to that in any way -- though I think if you watched that interview I think there were a number of things that didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite seem to jibe with the better part of reality.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that include the terrorist attack domestically?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he mentioned that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any domestic terror attacks in the previous administration, and sort of interesting that the mayor of New York had forgotten that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second question is you\xe2\x80\x99ve now re-nominated Dawn Johnsen -- don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make it sound like Don Johnson -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You said that in a way in which leads me to believe that somebody asked you whether we had nominated Crockett\xe2\x80\x99s partner to be -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you going to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think he was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Was he?\xc2\xa0 Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s right?\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, I think I was pretty young.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Jeopardy."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m down 500 apparently.</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve renominated her, what are you going to do differently to make sure she gets the 60 votes needed for passage?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Sam, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in here, obviously I think one of the things that the President and the administration would like to see is a change in the pacing of nominations in general being addressed by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We have seen over the course of many months I think a very intentional slowdown of the work that the Senate does, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think serves anybody in any political party well.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and the team will continue to work with the Senate to get to the 60 votes that would be needed for Ms. Johnsen to pass the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No talk of a recess appointment?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to the intelligence technology from the review, the report said that incomplete and faulty database searches were part of the problem, as well as the "information technology within the counterterrorism community, did not sufficiently enable the correlation of data."\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the intelligence community have the technology it needs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in some ways -- obviously there have been great technological advances, as you heard John talk about.\xc2\xa0 And in many ways what we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- the difference between and the improvements that were added after the attacks of September 11th is we knocked down walls between databases and that were maintained in certain agencies.\xc2\xa0 And in fact part of what happened after 9/11 was there was actually intentional redundancy added so that different places in the intelligence community could have access to information that is gathered by others.</p>\n<p>I think what John and others want to do is see that we ensure that those advances keep up with the best technology available, as well as I think you heard John also discuss the -- we now have the benefit of a lot more information coming in.\xc2\xa0 And we have to ensure, as the President did in those -- in his individual recommendations, ensure that there is the assignment of responsibility and the quick dissemination of all of that information, and that we do so in a technological way that allows us to keep up with the constant flow of important information that\xe2\x80\x99s coming in.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President planning to attend the annual congressional retreat next week to lobby for them to work together on health care reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- again, if I would have -- my life would have been easier if I\xe2\x80\x99d have remembered to bring that one piece of paper that I know exactly where it is on my desk.\xc2\xa0 I think we -- I think we have -- yes, I know, don\xe2\x80\x99t blame it on Bill, it was my fault -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll look in there and see whether he\xe2\x80\x99s going to that and going to other caucuses.</p>\n<p>Major, you have one more, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann brought up feverish, sometimes, Internet debates.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could address publicly the reaction that\xe2\x80\x99s gone on a bit on the Internet, since the President in mid-December signed an executive order granting Interpol certain rights and immunities here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 There are some who are wondering if that has created a opening for Interpol to have extraordinary police powers in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Who requested it?\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of its role in the United States as a policing organization?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the executive order updated Interpol\xe2\x80\x99s status based on the fact that within the past five years they\xe2\x80\x99ve opened a permanent office here in order to assist in the type of information-sharing between governments that we all know is so important.</p>\n<p>That simply -- all that does is simply bring them -- give them the same privileges and responsibilities that many other international organizations have in this country, like the IAEA, the Red Cross, and things like the IMF.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give them police powers --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that in any way threaten the U.S. constitutional rights --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not an enforcement --\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Since the Christmas Day incident, can you tell me were there any discussions that took place here at the White House which question whether or not Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab would be tried as an enemy combatant?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- whether those conversations took place --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here at the White House, as to whether 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab should be tried as an enemy combatant?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say a lot of subjects were covered in the Situation Room in terms of intelligence-sharing and prosecutions going forward.\xc2\xa0 That was something -- his status was discussed, and it was I think in the Situation Room where the President was briefed on the notion that the grand jury was likely to indict him, as they did the next day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just follow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick one.\xc2\xa0 Since President has spoken in Turkey, in Cairo, and also yesterday as far as clear-cut, crystal clear message to the Muslim and Arab world, is there more to be done -- do you think President will take another route to give them education on how to bring them into democracy or into our system or if they have misled the young people?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think in the near future the President will specifically address some of the circumstances around recruitment in different regions of the world, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into specifics on that right now but I think that will be -- that will come quite soon.\xc2\xa0 We may do it in --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quickly, is this message, President message, reaching to the corners of these especially Muslim and Arab countries?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are they reaching the?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Muslim and Arab countries --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if the leaders are getting this message?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say yes because I think if you look at the government of Yemen, if you look at the activities that are going on now in Pakistan and in other places, these governments understand that al Qaeda and its extremist allies don\xe2\x80\x99t simply seek to do harm to others outside of those countries, but to kill, as you heard the President and John Brennan talk about, to kill people within their own countries; spreading terror -- not just in hopes of spreading terror here in our homeland, but doing obviously violent and horrific damage in those countries, as well.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as a result of those activities actions that have been taken by the Yemeni government and by the Pakistanis to address that growing extremist threat.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you guys are talking about, but I think I should probably leave before you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forgive me.\xc2\xa0 On Ann\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to ask, was your answer to her meaning that the 2nd is definitely not it for the State of the Union message?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was -- I love that all of a sudden they realized ABC was asking on behalf of ABC whether -- (laughter) -- exactly.\xc2\xa0 No, I can allay fears that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal on the Internet.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal at ABC.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also tell NBC what to do with Leno and Conan?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is a challenge that I will leave exclusively to them.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Fort Hood report?\xc2\xa0 Any status on the timing of the Fort Hood report?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I meant to -- I sent an email to Denis on that and I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on it right now.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:37 P.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
