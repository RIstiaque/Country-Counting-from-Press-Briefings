EDT</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everyone, for joining us, especially so late.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to get you on the line quickly with some senior administration officials to talk about the operation today regarding Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 And with that I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to our first senior administration official.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us, everybody, at this late hour.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s much appreciated.\xc2\xa0 From the outset of the administration, the President has placed the highest priority in protecting the nation from the threat of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 In line with this, we have pursued an intensified, targeted, and global effort to degrade and defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Included in this effort has been a relentless set of steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to locate and bring Osama bin Laden to justice.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, in the earliest days of the administration, the President formally instructed the intelligence community and his counterterrorism advisors to make the pursuit of Osama bin Laden, as the leader of al Qaeda, as a top priority.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the beginning of September of last year, the CIA began to work with the President on a set of assessments that led it to believe that in fact it was possible that Osama bin Laden may be located at a compound in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 By mid-February, through a series of intensive meetings at the White House and with the President, we had determined there was a sound intelligence basis for pursuing this in an aggressive way and developing courses of action to pursue Osama bin Laden at this location.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the middle of March, the President began a series of National Security Council meetings that he chaired to pursue again the intelligence basis and to develop courses of action to bring justice to Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, by my count, the President chaired no fewer than five National Security Council meetings on the topic from the middle of March -- March 14th, March 29th, April 12th, April 19th, and April 28th.\xc2\xa0 And the President gave the final order to pursue the operation that he announced to the nation tonight on the morning -- Friday morning of April 29th.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned tonight that the pursuit of Osama bin Laden and the defeat of al Qaeda has been a bipartisan exercise in this nation since September 11, 2001, and indeed, this evening before he spoke to the nation, President Obama did speak to President Bush 43 and President Clinton this evening to review with them the events of today and to preview his statement to the nation tonight.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to my colleague to go through some of the details.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 As you heard, the President ordered a raid earlier today against an al Qaeda compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Based on intelligence collection analysis, a small U.S. team found Osama bin Laden living in a large home on a secured compound in an affluent suburb of Islamabad.\xc2\xa0 The raid occurred in the early morning hours in Pakistan and accomplished its objective.\xc2\xa0 Osama bin Laden is now no longer a threat to America.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This remarkable achievement could not have happened without persistent effort and careful planning over many years.\xc2\xa0 Our national security professionals did a superb job.\xc2\xa0 They deserve tremendous credit for serving justice to Osama bin Laden.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden was a sworn enemy of the United States and a danger to all humanity; a man who called for the murder of any American anywhere on Earth.\xc2\xa0 His death is central to the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of disrupting, dismantling, and ultimately defeating al Qaeda and its violent allies.\xc2\xa0 He was responsible for killing thousands of innocent men and women not only on 9/11, but in the 1998 East Africa embassy bombing, the attack of the USS Cole, and many other acts of brutality.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was the leader of a violent extremist movement with affiliates across the globe that had taken up arms against the United States and its allies.\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s most influential role has been to designate the United States as al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s primary target and to maintain organizational focus on that objective.\xc2\xa0 This strategic objective, which was first made in a 1996 declaration of jihad against Americans, was the cornerstone of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s message.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since 9/11, multiple agencies within our intelligence community have worked tirelessly to track down bin Laden, knowing that his removal from al Qaeda would strike a crippling blow to the organization and its militant allies.\xc2\xa0 And last September the President was made aware of a compound in Abbottabad, where a key al Qaeda facilitator appeared to be harboring a high-value target.\xc2\xa0 He received regular intelligence updates, as was just mentioned, on the compound in September, and he directed that action be taken as soon as he concluded that the intelligence case was sufficiently strong.\xc2\xa0 A range of options for achieving the mission were developed, and on Friday he authorized the operation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it to my colleagues to go through the intelligence.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 First I want to point out that today\xe2\x80\x99s success was a team effort.\xc2\xa0 It was a model of really seamless collaboration across our government.\xc2\xa0 Since 9/11, this is what the American people have expected of us, and today, in this critical operation, we were able to finally deliver.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The operation itself was the culmination of years of careful and highly advanced intelligence work.\xc2\xa0 Officers from the CIA, the NGA, the NSA all worked very hard as a team to analyze and pinpoint this compound.\xc2\xa0 Together they applied their very unique expertise and capabilities to America\xe2\x80\x99s most vexing intelligence problem, where to find bin Laden.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the case had been made that this was a critical target, we began to prepare this mission in conjunction with the U.S. military.\xc2\xa0 In the end, it was the matchless skill and courage of these Americans that secured this triumph for our country and the world.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of the entire team that worked on this operation, and am very thankful to the President for the courage that he displayed in making the decision to proceed with this operation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, let me turn to my colleague to give you details on the intelligence background.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The bottom line of our collection and our analysis was that we had high confidence that the compound harbored a high-value terrorist target.\xc2\xa0 The experts who worked this issue for years assessed that there was a strong probability that the terrorist that was hiding there was Osama bin Laden.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is walk you through the key points in that intelligence trail that led us to that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 From the time that we first recognized bin Laden as a threat, the CIA gathered leads on individuals in bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle, including his personal couriers.\xc2\xa0 Detainees in the post-9/11 period flagged for us individuals who may have been providing direct support to bin Laden and his deputy, Zawahiri, after their escape from Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One courier in particular had our constant attention.\xc2\xa0 Detainees gave us his nom de guerre or his nickname and identified him as both a prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of September 11th, and a trusted assistant of Abu Faraj al-Libbi, the former number three of al Qaeda who was captured in 2005.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Detainees also identified this man as one of the few al Qaeda couriers trusted by bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 They indicated he might be living with and protecting bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 But for years, we were unable to identify his true name or his location.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Four years ago, we uncovered his identity, and for operational reasons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t go into details about his name or how we identified him, but about two years ago, after months of persistent effort, we identified areas in Pakistan where the courier and his brother operated.\xc2\xa0 Still we were unable to pinpoint exactly where they lived, due to extensive operational security on their part.\xc2\xa0 The fact that they were being so careful reinforced our belief that we were on the right track.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then in August 2010, we found their residence, a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a town about 35 miles north of Islamabad.\xc2\xa0 The area is relatively affluent, with lots of retired military.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also insolated from the natural disasters and terrorist attacks that have afflicted other parts of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 When we saw the compound where the brothers lived, we were shocked by what we saw -- an extraordinarily unique compound.\xc2\xa0 The compound sits on a large plot of land in an area that was relatively secluded when it was built.\xc2\xa0 It is roughly eight times larger than the other homes in the area.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the compound was built in 2005, it was on the outskirts of the town center, at the end of a narrow dirt road.\xc2\xa0 In the last six years, some residential homes have been built nearby.\xc2\xa0 The physical security measures of the compound are extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 It has 12- to 18-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\xc2\xa0 Internal wall sections -- internal walls sectioned off different portions of the compound to provide extra privacy.\xc2\xa0 Access to the compound is restricted by two security gates, and the residents of the compound burn their trash, unlike their neighbors, who put the trash out for collection.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The main structure, a three-story building, has few windows facing the outside of the compound.\xc2\xa0 A terrace on the third floor has a seven-foot wall privacy -- has a seven-foot privacy wall.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also noteworthy that the property is valued at approximately $1 million but has no telephone or Internet service connected to it.\xc2\xa0 The brothers had no explainable source of wealth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Intelligence analysts concluded that this compound was custom built to hide someone of significance.\xc2\xa0 We soon learned that more people were living at the compound than the two brothers and their families.\xc2\xa0 A third family lived there -- one whose size and whose makeup matched the bin Laden family members that we believed most likely to be with Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 Our best assessment, based on a large body of reporting from multiple sources, was that bin Laden was living there with several family members, including his youngest wife.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everything we saw -- the extremely elaborate operational security, the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 background and their behavior, and the location and the design of the compound itself was perfectly consistent with what our experts expected bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s hideout to look like.\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind that two of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s gatekeepers, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abu Faraj al-Libbi, were arrested in the settled areas of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our analysts looked at this from every angle, considering carefully who other than bin Laden could be at the compound.\xc2\xa0 We conducted red team exercises and other forms of alternative analysis to check our work.\xc2\xa0 No other candidate fit the bill as well as bin Laden did.</p>\n<p>So the final conclusion, from an intelligence standpoint, was twofold.\xc2\xa0 We had high confidence that a high-value target was being harbored by the brothers on the compound, and we assessed that there was a strong probability that that person was Osama bin Laden.</p>\n<p>Now let me turn it over to my colleague.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this afternoon, a small U.S. team conducted a helicopter raid on the compound.\xc2\xa0 Considerable planning helped prepare our operators for this very complex mission.\xc2\xa0 Senior officials have been involved in the decision-making and planning for this operation for months, and briefed the President regularly.\xc2\xa0 My colleague has already mentioned the unusual characteristics of this compound.\xc2\xa0 Each of these, including the high walls, security features, suburban location, and proximity to Islamabad made this an especially dangerous operation.</p>\n<p>The men who executed this mission accepted this risk, practiced to minimize those risks, and understood the importance of the target to the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>I know you understand that I can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t get into many details of this mission, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll share what I can.\xc2\xa0 This operation was a surgical raid by a small team designed to minimize collateral damage and to pose as little risk as possible to non-combatants on the compound or to Pakistani civilians in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Our team was on the compound for under 40 minutes and did not encounter any local authorities while performing the raid.\xc2\xa0 In addition to Osama bin Laden, three adult males were killed in the raid.\xc2\xa0 We believe two were the couriers and the third was bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s adult son.</p>\n<p>There were several women and children at the compound.\xc2\xa0 One woman was killed when she was used as a shield by a male combatant.\xc2\xa0 Two other women were injured.</p>\n<p>During the raid, we lost one helicopter due to mechanical failure.\xc2\xa0 The aircraft was destroyed by the crew and the assault force and crew members boarded the remaining aircraft to exit the compound.\xc2\xa0 All non-combatants were moved safely away from the compound before the detonation.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s all I have at this time.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it back to my colleague.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We shared our intelligence on this bin Laden compound with no other country, including Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 That was for one reason and one reason alone:\xc2\xa0 We believed it was essential to the security of the operation and our personnel.\xc2\xa0 In fact, only a very small group of people inside our own government knew of this operation in advance.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the raid, U.S. officials contacted senior Pakistani leaders to brief them on the intent and the results of the raid.\xc2\xa0 We have also contacted a number of our close allies and partners throughout the world.</p>\n<p>Sine 9/11, the United States has made it clear to Pakistan that we would pursue bin Laden wherever he might be.\xc2\xa0 Pakistan has long understood that we are at war with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 The United States had a legal and moral obligation to act on the information it had.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And let me emphasize that great care was taken to ensure operational success, minimize the possibility of non-combatant casualties, and to adhere to American and international law in carrying out the mission.</p>\n<p>I should note that in the wake of this operation, there may be a heightened threat to the homeland and to U.S. citizens and facilities abroad.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda operatives and sympathizers may try to respond violently to avenge bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s death, and other terrorist leaders may try to accelerate their efforts to strike the United States.\xc2\xa0 But the United States is taking every possible precaution to protect Americans here at home and overseas.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has sent guidance to embassies worldwide and a travel advisory has been issued for Pakistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And without a doubt, the United States will continue to face terrorist threats.\xc2\xa0 The United States will continue to fight those threats.\xc2\xa0 We have always understood that this fight would be a marathon and not a sprint.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also no doubt that the death of Osama bin Laden marks the single greatest victory in the U.S.-led campaign to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 It is a major and essential step in bringing about al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s eventual destruction.</p>\n<p>Bin Laden was al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s only (inaudible) commander in its 22-year history, and was largely responsible for the organization\xe2\x80\x99s mystique, its attraction among violent jihadists, and its focus on America as a terrorist target.\xc2\xa0 As the only al Qaeda leader whose authority was universally respected, he also maintained his cohesion, and his likely successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is far less charismatic and not as well respected within the organization, according to comments from several captured al Qaeda leaders.\xc2\xa0 He probably will have difficulty maintaining the loyalty of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s largely Gulf Arab followers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Although al Qaeda may not fragment immediately, the loss of bin Laden puts the group on a path of decline that will be difficult to reverse.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that it is most fitting that bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s death comes at a time of great movement towards freedom and democracy that is sweeping the Arab world.\xc2\xa0 He stood in direct opposition to what the greatest men and women throughout the Middle East and North Africa are risking their lives for:\xc2\xa0 individual rights and human dignity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 With that we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to take a couple questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question.\xc2\xa0 You said \xe2\x80\x9ca small U.S. team.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Were these military personnel, can you say, or non-military?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Can\xe2\x80\x99t go into further details at this time; just a small U.S. team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us specifically what contact there was with bin Laden at the compound?\xc2\xa0 You referred to someone using a woman as a shield that was not bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 But how was he killed?\xc2\xa0 Where?\xc2\xa0 What occurred at the compound?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 As the President said this evening, bin Laden was killed in a firefight as our operators came onto the compound.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just to go back to what you were talking about with the attacks in response to this operation, are you hearing any specific threats against specific targets?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 But any type of event like this, it is very prudent for us to take measures so that we can ensure that the security measures that we need to institute here and throughout the world are in place.\xc2\xa0 This is just something that we normally would do.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific threats at this time related to this.\xc2\xa0 But we are ensuring that every possible precaution is taken in advance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, hey, how are you doing?\xc2\xa0 My question would be, what was the type of the helicopter that failed?\xc2\xa0 And what was the nature of that mechanical failure?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Can\xe2\x80\x99t go into details at this time.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was mechanical.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was bin Laden involved in firing himself or defending himself?\xc2\xa0 And then any chronology of the raid itself?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 He did resist the assault force.\xc2\xa0 And he was killed in a firefight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for taking this call.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me a comment on the very fact that Osama bin Laden was just in Islamabad -- and has long been (inaudible) Afghanistan (inaudible) also from India, that Osama bin Laden is hiding somewhere near Islamabad?\xc2\xa0 What does it signify, that?\xc2\xa0 Does it signify any cooperation or any kind of link that he had with establishments in Pakistan?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 As the President said, Pakistani cooperation had assisted in this lead, as we pursued it.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work this issue right now.\xc2\xa0 We are very concerned about -- that he was inside of Pakistan, but this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with the Pakistani government on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the very fact you didn\xe2\x80\x99t inform the Pakistani authorities -- did you have any suspicion that if you informed them, the information might lead somewhere?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 An operation like this that is conducted has the utmost operational security attached to it.\xc2\xa0 I said that we had shared this information with no other country, and that a very, very small group of individuals within the United States government was aware of this.\xc2\xa0 That is for operational security purposes.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I would also just add to that that President Obama, over a period of several years now, has repeatedly made it clear that if we had actionable intelligence about Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, we would act.\xc2\xa0 So President Obama has been very clear in delivering that message publicly over a period of years.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what led President Obama to order this operation.\xc2\xa0 When he determined that the intelligence was actionable and the intelligence case was sufficient, he gave us high confidence that bin Laden indeed was at the compound.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 What is going to happen next?\xc2\xa0 And what is the U.S. going to do with bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s body?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We are ensuring that it is handled in accordance with Islamic practice and tradition.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we take very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And so therefore this is being handled in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Great, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just to remind everyone, this call is on background, as senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 We have time for one more question, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go to bed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of the vintage of the compound and how long bin Laden had been there?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The compound has been in existence for roughly five years, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long bin Laden lived there.\xc2\xa0 We assess that the compound was built for the purpose of harboring him.\xc2\xa0 But again, don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long he\xe2\x80\x99s been there.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Great, thank you all.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk more tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 12:24 A.M.
