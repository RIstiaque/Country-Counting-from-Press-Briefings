Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:17 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see all your smiling faces this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 It must be because it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday there are so many smiles.\xc2\xa0 Well, today is my final briefing as the Principal Deputy Press Secretary.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased that there\xe2\x80\x99s such a strong turnout to mark this occasion.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for your Hallmark cards later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still on Jay time, then.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are still on Jay time.\xc2\xa0 Since you brought him up, I will say one thing.\xc2\xa0 He did his last briefing here on Wednesday, and he is somebody who devoted a significant portion of his life over the last three years working hard to serve this President and to serve all of you.\xc2\xa0 And we are sad to see him go, but wish him all the best as he pursues the next chapter in his career and sensibly, will spend more time with his family in a way that he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty happy about and presumably, they are too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Colbert.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 So, Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you do the first question today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 At risk of jumping the gun for Monday, I on behalf of my colleagues wanted to welcome you to your new role behind the podium.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not your first rodeo, but it\xe2\x80\x99s official now.\xc2\xa0 So, welcome.</p>\n<p>If we could start on Ukraine, President Poroshenko has declared a unilateral ceasefire for the next week.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, the Russian troops along the border that we had seen pulled back looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re heading back to the border.\xc2\xa0 So is the U.S. concerned about a buildup of Russian forces along the border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The short answer to your question, Josh, is yes, we are.\xc2\xa0 The United States has been very clear in our support for President Poroshenko\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bring peace and unity to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 President Poroshenko has been clear since he took office that he is committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the crisis, and he has offered to grant amnesty to separatists within Ukraine and provide safe passage back to Russia to those Russian militants operating in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 He has also committed to continue a national dialogue to unite the country and pledged to de-centralize power and undertake constitutional reform to address the legitimate concerns of the Iranian people -- of the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p>Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been very clear that there are some asks of President Putin as well.\xc2\xa0 We have repeatedly called on the Russians to support peace and to promote some stability to the security situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also asked them to halt the provision of arms and materiel across the border from Russia to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We also want them to stop supporting the militants who are fomenting so much violence and instability in that country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, unfortunately, there is mounting evidence that shows a buildup of Russian military forces near the border with Ukraine, contrary to the statements by Kremlin officials.\xc2\xa0 We do not see any evidence that the Russian military units arriving to the region are connected to any type of border security mission.\xc2\xa0 And further, reports from Moscow that the Russian Defense Ministry is considering creating military cordons in eastern Ukraine are also troubling.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring the situation closely.\xc2\xa0 And we will not accept any use of Russian military forces under any pretext in eastern Ukraine; after all, eastern Ukraine is a sovereign country.\xc2\xa0 And interference by outside countries is a violation of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is one other point that I actually want to raise here that is also important and of some concern.\xc2\xa0 In addition, inflammatory statements such as those by Foreign Minister Lavrov earlier this week in which he described ethnic cleansing taking place in Ukraine are simply false.\xc2\xa0 We see these statements for what they are, an attempt to create pretext for further illegal Russian intervention in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 In fact, responsibility for the deterioration in the human rights situation in Ukraine lies with the armed separatists who are targeting the population and their backers in Russia.\xc2\xa0 Multiple reports by human rights monitors over the past several months have indicated that armed separatists groups supported by Russia are perpetrating an increasing number of killings, abductions, and other violent human rights abuses in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And the same is happening in Crimea under Russian occupation.</p>\n<p>What the President said in Europe and actually had the opportunity to communicate directly to President Putin was that there is an opportunity for Russia to play a constructive role in this process.\xc2\xa0 There is no reason for the people of Ukraine to have to choose between good relations with Russia and good relations with the West.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for them to have both.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re only going to have those solid relations if Russia respects the sovereignty of Ukraine and works in a cooperative fashion to bring some stability to the security situation there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify, you said that eastern Ukraine was a sovereign country, but you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to eastern Ukraine as part of a sovereign Ukraine.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to move to Iraq, the top Shiite cleric there, al-Sistani, is now calling for there to be a new government.\xc2\xa0 Considering that he\xe2\x80\x99s a member of al-Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s own religious group, does that lead the U.S. to think that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a new government there to take over?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The views of this administration have not changed, which is that the leadership of the Iraqi government should be determined by the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 That is the policy of this administration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President reiterated when he spoke to you yesterday from this podium.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, it is also the belief of the Obama administration and of the President personally that a successful Iraqi government, that is an Iraqi central government that has control over the country and can bring some stability to the security situation there, will be a government that governs in an inclusive fashion.\xc2\xa0 Pursuing an inclusive political agenda is critical to the success of that country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s critical to demonstrating to all of the people in Iraq that they have an interest in that country\xe2\x80\x99s prosperity and in that country\xe2\x80\x99s future.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support the Iraqi people and support the Iraqi government as they consider pursuing a diplomatic or political agenda along these lines.</p>\n<p>Roberta, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the next.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The new programs announced today to deal with the child immigration problem, where is the money for those new programs going to come from?\xc2\xa0 Does Congress have to approve that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just back up just a little bit to make sure that everybody is up to date in terms of what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here.</p>\n<p>What was announced earlier today by the Department of Homeland Security was a commitment of additional judges, asylum officers and immigration attorneys to deal with what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in terms of the increasing flow of adults who are showing up at the border between the United States and Mexico.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have also committed resources to opening up facilities in this country to deal with the growing problem of adults who appear on the border with children; that is adults from other countries who are seeking to illegally enter this country, and have children with them.</p>\n<p>And then once those facilities are up and running, we will then deploy a similar surge of judges, asylum officers and attorneys to more quickly and efficiently deal with those immigration cases.\xc2\xa0 In many cases, these are asylum requests.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ll have asylum officers and judges there to process them quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p>In terms of paying for this, I don\'t have any details to offer you specifically here.\xc2\xa0 I will just point out that in recent weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen comments from Democrats and Republicans in Congress expressing concern about this situation, about this influx that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing along the southern border, mostly in the Rio Grande Valley.\xc2\xa0 So it would be our hope and expectation that those members of Congress who are expressing concern about this situation will work collaboratively with the administration to make sure we have the resources necessary to deal with this growing problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no information about how many officers, judges, and how this will be paid for at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, no.\xc2\xa0 But again, in terms of paying for it, we would want to work with members of Congress to make sure that the necessary resources are available to deal with a problem they admit exists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on -- there was lots of excitement today about the IRS.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the White House would consider naming an independent prosecutor, some kind of independent person to clear the air over that? \xc2\xa0And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that many Republicans in Congress at least, particularly in the House have demonstrated a pretty aggressive appetite for investigating this issue.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen extensive cooperation by the Internal Revenue Service and members of the Obama administration with that investigation.\xc2\xa0 There have been 750,000 pages of documents that have provided; 64,000 different emails from one specific IRS employee.\xc2\xa0 So our willingness to cooperate with this investigate is evident from the numbers.</p>\n<p>The thing that is also true is that there have been a large number of claims and conspiracy theories that have been floated about this process by Republicans that just have not panned out, frankly.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated our willingness to collaborate with them with legitimate oversight.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to cooperate, and that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- that\'s why there\xe2\x80\x99s been the testimony that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today because there are senior Obama administration officials that are going up there and answering all of these questions; again, some of which are rooted in the kinds of conspiracy theories that don\'t have any truth to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it help just having an independent person come in and look at it?\xc2\xa0 I mean if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that what they\'re doing is political, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it help to have an independent person look at it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, because I think even the politically motivated investigation has not turned up any facts that support the conspiracy theories that they\xe2\x80\x99ve propounded.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is after 13 months of multiple congressional investigations, including 14 congressional hearings, 30 interviews with IRS employees, 50 written congressional requests, and as I mentioned 750,000 pages of documents, there is zero evidence to support Republican claims.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s even -- again, these are investigations that have a pretty transparent political motive.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot more to be discovered here.</p>\n<p>I guess the other thing I would point out is that there has been an independent inspector general investigation that\'s also been conducted here.\xc2\xa0 And according to his testimony, he also found no evidence that anyone outside of the IRS had any involvement in the inappropriate targeting of conservative groups who applied for tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve cooperated extensively with a large number of congressional hearings, many of which were politically motivated.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve cooperated with an independent inspector general investigation, who did not find any evidence that supports Republican claims.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think frankly we\xe2\x80\x99d prefer that Republicans would devote this kind of attention and energy to policies that are actually going to create jobs, as opposed to partisan fishing expeditions.</p>\n<p>So let\xe2\x80\x99s move around the room just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if I could get your reaction to the Republican leadership yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And specifically kind of what your guys\xe2\x80\x99 opinion on Kevin McCarthy is in the building, and how you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with him kind of moving forward?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would certainly first begin by congratulating Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Scalise for their successful elections.\xc2\xa0 They were voted into their leadership positions by their peers in the Republican Congress.\xc2\xa0 And as the elected leaders of one party and one house of Congress, the administration will seek to work with them to try to find common ground.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt they haven\xe2\x80\x99t papered over the differences.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t either in terms of our policy views and what we think is in the best interest of the country moving forward.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of differences.\xc2\xa0 What we hope we can focus on are those areas of common ground, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see whether or not they are -- they\'re willing to do that.</p>\n<p>If there is a willingness by those members of the Republican leadership to try to find common ground with the administration on a range of policies that would better support middle-class families all across the country, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find willing partners on this end of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Valerie Jarrett earlier this morning suggested that McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s election kind of opened a window of opportunity for immigration reform to happen this summer.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, both, if you guys have reached out to him in any way, or had discussions with him about pursuing immigration reform this summer?</p>\n<p>And secondly, conventional wisdom of course is that Eric Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s defeat would make Republicans skittish in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And so why do you feel like that\'s -- in fact, the opposite is true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any specific phone calls or meetings with Mr. McCarthy to read out to you at this point.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed my own bemusement about the political analysis that has reached the conclusion that a candidate for office who was strongly opposed to immigration reform was somehow the key to the passage of immigration reform, right?\xc2\xa0 I think as I mentioned earlier, I just moved to Virginia.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t move into the 7th Congressional District, but I saw a lot of those mailers that Mr. Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s campaign distributed, and he made pretty clear that he was opposed to immigration reform.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why there is this notion that if he had been elected that it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely that immigration reform would have passed.\xc2\xa0 He was promising to do everything he could to block it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, that\'s unfortunate, and I think it is an open question whether or not the prospects for immigration reform\xe2\x80\x99s passage are enhanced by Mr. McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s ascension to a higher position in the Republican leadership.</p>\n<p>I know that there are many in Mr. McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s district in California that are strongly supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not actually unique.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of people all across the country for a wide range of reasons in both parties who are strongly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform; along the lines of the compromise that was passed in bipartisan fashion in the Senate last year.\xc2\xa0 So there are plenty of good economic reasons to support immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think as the Congressional Budget Office has found that there are hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit reduction over the next couple of decades that would be enjoyed by this country if immigration reform were to pass.</p>\n<p>But again, this will have to be a decision that Mr. McCarthy makes as he gets settled into what presumably is a fancy new office in the Capitol.</p>\n<p>All right, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the unaccompanied minors, if you could talk about this a moment.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know the Vice President is down in Central America today, and the White House has been adamant that White House policies, the DREAM Act and also comprehensive immigration reform are not the reasons why people are crossing the border.\xc2\xa0 But, in fact -- and in fact, that may be true.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing is that they\'re coming here not because of that, but because they realize that once they get here -- moms with kids, and kids themselves -- that the bureaucratic system in this country allows them to stay in many cases.</p>\n<p>And we can\'t get answers from this administration about the numbers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve asked repeatedly how many people who are given these promises to appear notices, these are the mothers who get promises to appear notices, and then are allowed to go stay with relatives and go to -- and promise to go to court -- how many of them are actually going to court versus how many are disappearing into the fabric of the country?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And a related question to that is, how many of the unaccompanied minors are then released to foster homes or their relatives in this country and, in fact, are allowed to stay?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the real reason they\'re coming across?\xc2\xa0 And why won\xe2\x80\x99t the administration answer those questions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I do want to take this opportunity to make something really clear first of all that so much of what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the southern border is the result of a deliberate, misinformation campaign that is propagated by criminal syndicates in Central America.\xc2\xa0 That misinformation is causing some people who are in a rather desperate situation to risk their lives to come to the United States border expecting that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to stay in this country.\xc2\xa0 That is simply not true.\xc2\xa0 And it is important for people all across this country and for people in Mexico and Central America to understand what the facts are.</p>\n<p>And the reason for that is simple.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing there is a very serious humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 It is one that is the source of significant concern to the President.\xc2\xa0 And so his administration is trying to deploy a lot of resources to deal with this.</p>\n<p>And that\'s manifested itself in a number of different ways.\xc2\xa0 You saw that we put a readout just yesterday of the President\xe2\x80\x99s phone call with President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto of Mexico in which they discussed this situation.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, as you mentioned, is traveling in Central America, where he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with leaders of El Salvador and Guatemala, as well as senior government representatives from Honduras and Mexico.\xc2\xa0 The State Department and DHS officials have been engaged with their colleagues and their counterparts in countries throughout the hemisphere to talk about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is to address this problem in two ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is to address the needs of those who have been apprehended on the border.</p>\n<p>So I was mentioning to Roberta that DHS announced earlier today that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to open up some additional detention facilities that can accommodate adults who show up on the border with their children.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deploy some resources to work through their immigration cases more quickly, so that they\xe2\x80\x99re not held in that detention facility for a long time and can, hopefully, be quickly returned to their home country.</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99re also doing is working in collaborative fashion with countries in Central America to try to address the problem at its root.\xc2\xa0 Some of that is an information campaign and countering this intentional misinformation campaign that\xe2\x80\x99s being propagated by criminal syndicates, but also working through a range of USAID programs and the host governments -- the governments in these countries -- to try to meet some of the citizen security needs that are so acute in these countries right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand all that, Josh, but the question is, is it really a misinformation campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 It is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking, okay.\xc2\xa0 What is happening now is that the Border Patrol is taking those mothers and kids, putting them in a bus and taking them to the bus station in McAllen, Texas.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re buying tickets to go stay with relatives in this country with a promise -- all they have to do is promise that they will appear in court.\xc2\xa0 And the administration will not tell us how many of those we\xe2\x80\x99re promising to go to court are really going to court, and are going into the system or are actually disappearing into the fabric of American society.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the coyotes are telling people, is that the bureaucracy in this country is allowing them to stay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to make a blanket statement about our immigration policy other than this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 And the law is very clear about this, that those individuals who want to show up on the border -- whether they have their children with them or not -- are not eligible for the deferred action that the administration announced a year or two ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what we are doing is we are mobilizing additional resources to try to deal with this problem more effectively and in a more humanitarian fashion.\xc2\xa0 And in this case --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why won\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell us the percentage of those who are promising to appear, are they appearing or not?\xc2\xa0 And are the unaccompanied minors who are then given to foster homes or allowed to stay with their families in this country while waiting for a court appearance, how many of those are actually showing up?\xc2\xa0 Why won\xe2\x80\x99t the administration tell us those numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those numbers here, Jim.\xc2\xa0 But what I do have is a clear commitment from this administration to deal with what is an emerging humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for your viewers to understand and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for viewers or those consumers of information in Central America to understand that showing up at the border illegally is not a ticket into this country.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons that the President is a strong and powerful advocate of the kind of commonsense immigration reform that I was discussing in response to an earlier question is that it would streamline our legal immigration process.</p>\n<p>For a variety of reasons -- some of them economic, some of them humanitarian -- there should be strong support for streamlining this process.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and Republicans have both acknowledged that the legal immigration process is not as efficient as it could be.\xc2\xa0 And better resources devoted to that system could mitigate some of this problem, but it does not change the fact that it is not a good idea for people to make the trek through Mexico and to appear at the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley of the United States and think that once they are detained by customs or Border Patrol personnel, that they will be allowed into the country.\xc2\xa0 They will not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Acosta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Josh, back to Russia.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this morning on that conference call with senior administration officials, they described that potential sanctions that could be imposed on Russia next might not be sectoral, but rather something more along the lines of a scalpel is the way it was described during that conference call.\xc2\xa0 That sounds like less than sectoral, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And does that mean that the administration is now backing away from that threat of sectoral sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, sectoral sanctions remain on the table.\xc2\xa0 And, again, this is something that the administration is working in cooperative fashion with our partners and allies in Europe to present a united front, that the more that Russia plays a destabilizing role in Ukraine, the more isolated from the international community they will become.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen that the sanctions that have been put in place so far in a cooperative fashion, again, with our allies in Europe, has had an impact on the Russian economy and has had an impact in terms of isolating them in the international financial markets.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be deterring their behavior though.\xc2\xa0 Is that fair to say?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair thing to say.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a lot of mixed signals from Russia right now about what their intentions are.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is evidenced by the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some troop movements on the border, some away from the border and some are toward the border.\xc2\xa0 And in those situations where Russia has made the decision to withdraw their troops, we welcomed the evidence of that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about this latest evidence that indicates that additional troops are being deployed to the border under the auspices of a border security policy or exercise that does not seem to be underway.</p>\n<p>So what the President will continue to do is to work with our partners in Europe that will maximize the impact of any sanctions that are implemented.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to give Russia the opportunity to pursue a policy of de-escalation, to play a constructive role in bringing some stability to the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Iraq, yesterday Senator Chris Murphy said that if more than 300 assets on the ground are deployed to Iraq that the administration would need to go through Congress for authorization.\xc2\xa0 Is the President okay with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what this President has said, and I think that there is pretty widespread agreement about this, maybe even ostensibly from Mr. Murphy, is that the actions that the President has taken so far do not require additional congressional authorization.\xc2\xa0 But you have seen a demonstrated commitment from this administration to continue to consult with Congress.</p>\n<p>The President hosted a consultation meeting with the four leaders of Congress in the Oval Office earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, as administration officials were assessing the situation in Iraq, there were a number of phone calls from senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team to leaders in Congress -- both those in the congressional leadership, but also those who are the leaders of relevant committees.\xc2\xa0 So that congressional consultation will continue.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the interest and the support of the American policy in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you heard the Senate Majority Leader say he doesn\'t want to see any U.S. forces returning to Iraq, it must have dawned on all of you here that there\xe2\x80\x99s a real reluctance inside the Democratic Party when it comes to getting re-engaged in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That\'s where it goes without saying.\xc2\xa0 How do you deal with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- that any time that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the risks to our security that are posed by Iraq, that the memory of the Iraq war is fresh in the mind of everybody in this country, that this country made great sacrifices in pursuit of trying to create an opportunity for the Iraqi people to enjoy democracy and determine the future of their own country.</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is that there are some Americans -- some very brave Americans who served in our military -- who sacrificed even more than others.\xc2\xa0 That is fresh in the mind of every policymaker, in the same way that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fresh in the mind of every American.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, I think the President was pretty clear when he spoke here yesterday about what exactly our priorities are.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me for a minute, let me just repeat them.\xc2\xa0 The first is that our top priority is the safety of U.S. personnel that currently is in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why you saw a movement over the weekend to deploy some additional security resources to safeguard the embassy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been an increase of intelligence resources in the region.\xc2\xa0 There is now around-the-clock visibility in Iraq, with particular attention to those areas where ISIL is operating.</p>\n<p>There has also been an increased support for Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 There has been an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to ramp up that support through training, through the provision of equipment and in other ways; and in the context of advisers that the President talked about yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has also ordered the prepositioning of some military assets.\xc2\xa0 There have been some announcements from the Department of Defense about where those assets are located and what role they could play if necessary.\xc2\xa0 And finally, there has been a stepped up diplomatic engagement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You all have been on the receiving end of a number of readouts of phone calls between the Vice President and Prime Minister Maliki.\xc2\xa0 And it was reported yesterday I think -- well, the President announced yesterday that Secretary Kerry would be traveling to the region this weekend to meet with his counterparts in the region, all of whom have a vested interest in the same way the United States does in a stabilized security situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yesterday -- just to wrap this up, yesterday one of the senior administration officials on that conference call following the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement did not rule out air strikes on ISIS targets or ISIL targets in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That was on a conference call on background, and so forth, so can we just get you on camera about this?\xc2\xa0 Is that a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me tell you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s resolve.\xc2\xa0 The President is resolved to take the action that\'s necessary to protect the United States of America, the homeland, certainly our American men and women who are serving in uniform, and our allies around the globe.\xc2\xa0 The President has demonstrated a willingness to go into other countries where necessary to protect our national and homeland security.</p>\n<p>You guys often report about actions that are taken in Yemen to neutralize those groups or individuals that are seeking to do harm to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is congressional authorization needed though?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are similar actions that are taken in Somalia under similar circumstances.\xc2\xa0 And just last weekend, we saw that the military and law enforcement action in Libya to ensure that one of the perpetrators of the attack on the Benghazi diplomatic post is brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 So there is a willingness by this President that has been determined -- that has been demonstrated to act where necessary to safeguard the national security.\xc2\xa0 And that applies in this situation too.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll move around a bit.\xc2\xa0 JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And congratulations.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President in touch with his allies -- Great Britain, France, Germany -- on a coordinated response to ISIL in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us any information on any conservations that may have taken place?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read out any phone calls at this point.\xc2\xa0 But there is strong concern about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iraq, both that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen exhibited by countries in the region, those countries that neighbor Syria and Iraq are concerned about the rapid progress that ISIL was able to make there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also concern that\xe2\x80\x99s been expressed by countries who worked closely with the United States over the years in Iraq to try to, again, stabilize the security situation, give the Iraqi people the opportunity to determine their own future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of people who are concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 My colleagues at the State Department, the Department of Defense and other places have been in touch with their counterparts as we pursue a coordinated approach to dealing with the challenges that are posed by extremists like ISIL who are operating too freely in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Juliet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President today signed a memorandum on the first-ever federal pollinator initiative.\xc2\xa0 And Dan Pfieffer has referred in the past to how this is a personal interest of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little about both that initiative and how it is that the President got interested in the honey bee, that crisis?\xc2\xa0 And butterflies, monarch butterflies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And butterflies.\xc2\xa0 Well, Juliet, when I walked out here today, I knew I was going to be handling a range of sensitive issues.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was going to be talking about the birds and the bees.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That was pretty good, right?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about this one all morning.\xc2\xa0 Groans, huh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Better writers -- get better writers.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get these guys on some better material here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You think I\xe2\x80\x99d get a better crowd on my first day here, but no.\xc2\xa0 Oh, my last day.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get my story straight, don\xe2\x80\x99t I -- okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Despite my lame attempt at humor, this actually is a serious issue.\xc2\xa0 The pollinators, the so-called pollinators that are covered by this presidential memorandum, actually have an impact of about $24 billion a year on the United States economy.\xc2\xa0 And they are vital to keeping fruits, nuts and vegetables in our diets.\xc2\xa0 So over the past few decades, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen a significant decline in pollinators from our budget -- or I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, from our environment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what the President will include in his 2015 budget are some commonsense steps and strategies that we can take to try to respond to this challenge.\xc2\xa0 So everything from directing federal government research and land management that would better facilitate a habitat for pollinators -- we can also work with states and tribal leaders, and even private landowners in some circumstances, to try to make sure that we are protecting the environments for pollinator habitats.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, again, there is a clear economic incentive for us to continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work in collaborative fashion with industry, with state and local leaders, with private landowners to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 So thank you for the question, Juliet.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I want to clarify something.\xc2\xa0 The White House is opposed to a special prosecutor, right, on the email controversy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think for the wide range of reasons that I recited earlier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the investigation of the emails, did the investigators or White House Counsel look at or look for emails between the White House and the chief of staff, or other aides of Lerner\xe2\x80\x99s?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are you asking about emails that would have been exchanged --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the White House to Lerner\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff or her other aides, top aides?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware that that was a specific request from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Have they asked for that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you.\xc2\xa0 Was it just confined --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roger, it turns out that there have been 13 months of multiple congressional investigations, including 14 congressional hearings, 30 interviews with IRS employees, 50 written congressional requests and 750,000 pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 And all of that has done nothing to substantiate false Republican claims of a broader political conspiracy.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99re floating another conspiracy or if this is a request from Republicans who are floating a conspiracy, or what exactly the suggestion is.</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is we\xe2\x80\x99ve cooperated extensively.\xc2\xa0 And despite that cooperation, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen continued allegations of Republican conspiracy theories that just never pan out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on that point, we understand -- I think what Roger is trying to get at is what I asked Jay a couple of days ago, which is that we understand you\xe2\x80\x99ve turned over -- the IRS has turned over tens of thousands of emails.\xc2\xa0 But when two years of emails from the time period that\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated, when tea party groups were allegedly targeted, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the facts, how can you say there\xe2\x80\x99s been extensive cooperation if two years of emails are just missing?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be taking that point seriously.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I would say, Ed, is that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair that we recognize that software moves on and that archiving in a digital age is not as easy as it might seem to the public.\xc2\xa0 Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t just my comments, but those are actually the comments of Congressman Darrell Issa on February 26th, 2008.\xc2\xa0 So his suggestion that somehow there\xe2\x80\x99s a political conspiracy going on here is not consistent with what he\xe2\x80\x99s previously said on this kind of issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, not conspiracies.\xc2\xa0 If the emails are there, you could show, hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s no conspiracy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xc2\xa0 I understand you want to keep saying it\xe2\x80\x99s about the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But why are two years missing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think Republicans keep making it about Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are two years of emails missing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because there was -- the computer crashed.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a demonstrated effort by this administration and by the IRS to try to cooperate with legitimate questions that have been posed by the committee on this.\xc2\xa0 So what that meant is that meant that we\xe2\x80\x99ve turned over 64,000 different emails from Ms. Lerner\xe2\x80\x99s account.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also gone back and tried to -- when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the IRS has gone back and looked for emails that may have been sent or received by her colleagues at the IRS, so that they could basically try to sort of build in a structure to give people a sense about what those emails were and what they indicate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that constitutes 24,000 emails -- additional emails or part of that -- let me say it this way, 67,000 emails have been provided to Congress, 24,000 of them come from this period during which her hard drive crashed and which those emails were lost.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been an effort to reconstruct that path.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a pretty clear demonstration of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to cooperate with legitimate oversight.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s just as important for people to understand is that despite all of the data that has been provided to Congress, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a shred of evidence that substantiates Republican conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll move on to a couple of other subjects.\xc2\xa0 On immigration, to follow up on what Jim was asking, not to belabor the point, but when you said that this is not a ticket into this country -- based on what Jim is saying, it is a ticket into this country for some illegal immigrants.\xc2\xa0 So will you at least take the question?\xc2\xa0 I understand you might not have the stats in front of you at this moment.\xc2\xa0 Will you take the question and by the end of today give us the numbers on how many people who promised to go to court actually go to court?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will take a look and see if those numbers are available.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t commit to giving them to you, but I will take a look and see if we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, a couple of quick things.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to Republicans who are saying that what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing play out in Iraq could happen in Afghanistan when our troops leave?\xc2\xa0 I understand we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving at least a small residual force behind, unlike Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But that we could see the same situation where the Taliban and other terrorists move in and take advantage of the situation.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly concerned about making sure that we leave behind a stable, self-governing, and self-securing Afghanistan when our troops come home.\xc2\xa0 That is an important part of this mission, is to turn over a stable Afghanistan so that the Afghan people can pursue the kind of future that is best for their country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I guess what I would say to Republicans who are worried about this is what\xe2\x80\x99s the alternative?\xc2\xa0 Is the alternative a commitment of American service personnel indefinitely in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to make that case.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that that is in the national security interest of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one -- you mentioned the Mexican President -- the President had a phone call with President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto.\xc2\xa0 In the readout, it did not mention whether they talked about the jail of the U.S. Marine in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Did the President press that case with the Mexican President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details of that conversation, but I can take a look into that for you, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Tamara.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding the unaccompanied minors, I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 First one, House Speaker John Boehner is calling for the National Guard to be sent to the border to help with the situation.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 It was a letter I guess to the President.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about the letter.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually read it myself.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that there is the view that there are already significant enforcement resources that have been deployed to the border.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a historic commitment by this administration to ensure that there are boots on the ground securing our border.</p>\n<p>And the fact is the commonsense immigration reform proposal that passed through the Senate a year ago actually includes a significant additional investment in resources to securing our border.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that last year 360,000 individuals who are attempting to cross the border were detained and removed from this country by existing resources.\xc2\xa0 So what that indicates is that there is already a robust effort on the border to secure this country and enforce our immigration laws.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also an indication that the President is willing to enforce that law strictly.\xc2\xa0 But those who are interested in additional resources being deployed to the border should support the commonsense, bipartisan immigration reform proposal that passed through the Senate and right now is being blocked by House Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is to say the President is not going to send in the National Guard at least immediately?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no specific plan right now to do that.\xc2\xa0 But again, there has been a demonstrated record of enforcing our immigration laws at the border.\xc2\xa0 And the enforcement of those laws will continue.\xc2\xa0 If there are those who believe that there should be additional resources placed to secure our border, I would strongly encourage them to consider supporting the bipartisan immigration reform proposal that passed in the Senate last year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could you also give a little bit more detail about what the hope is with the tens of millions of dollars that are being sent to Central American countries to presumably help relieve some of the situations there that are causing people to want to come here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are programs -- some of which are funded through USAID.\xc2\xa0 Others are part of security programs that we have -- or the continuation of security programs that we have with these countries.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the Department of State.\xc2\xa0 They may be able to provide you some more details on those programs, okay?</p>\n<p>Yes, this gentleman in the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in regards with the telephone call of President Obama with President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto, did he make any specific requests like maybe controlling better the south border with Mexico to prevent the crossing of these minors?\xc2\xa0 And also, there is going to be a special commission that analyze this situation with members of the U.S. Cabinet like Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, et cetera?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any additional details about that phone call to tell you about.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that the United States and the Obama administration in particular believes that there is an opportunity for us to work cooperatively to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 That means cooperating with the government of Mexico, and that also means cooperating with the governments of Guatemala and Honduras, El Salvador, and other nations in the region, that if we can address this problem before individuals show up on the border, that would be good and clearly in the best interests of those who are risking their lives to try to come to this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That means that maybe you are asking these governments to start campaigns to inform the people about the lies of the smugglers perhaps and make them aware of the danger?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are very interested in making sure that we use every available resource to correct the record and counter the coordinated misinformation campaign that\'s being spread by criminal syndicates throughout Central America.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 And there have been a range of things that have already done that.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the governments of those countries to make sure that message gets out.</p>\n<p>In terms of what you reference in your first question about the efforts of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet to address this problem, a couple of weeks ago, the President directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to take a hands-on role in coordinating the government response to the influx of immigrants we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing at the border.</p>\n<p>And so they have played a leading role in working with DHS and with HHS to open up additional facilities and make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re following the law both in terms of detaining individuals, but also making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that in a humanitarian fashion.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our hope that the announcement today of additional resources to process those asylum requests and to process these cases through the immigration courts more efficiently will also ensure that those individuals who are here are treated more humanely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any emphasis on more security in the southern border of Mexico?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Mexican government to provide you with any updates about that.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on that criminal syndicate.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some implications that it\xe2\x80\x99s position the drug cartels are simply doing this as a money-making operation.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have evidence of this?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re identifying them as a criminal syndicate that is perpetuating this misinformation.\xc2\xa0 What more do you guys know about who these people are?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the narcos?\xc2\xa0 Or is it some of these --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think there is a concern that there are criminal elements like narco-gangs and human traffickers who are involved in this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'re simply trying to profit off of rumors?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, who are taking advantage of vulnerable populations to try to make some money.\xc2\xa0 We remain very concerned about this.</p>\n<p>For more details on this, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DHS who is working the criminal element of this more aggressively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have -- would the FBI be involved?\xc2\xa0 Who would be involved of trying to get at these criminal elements that are doing this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a role for DHS to play.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked quite a bit about human trafficking, and the threat that this poses to our national security, and the humanitarian problem that it presents.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to have to work closely with the Mexican government to address this problem, as well.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was mentioned in the readout.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, going to the Border Patrol issue that Speaker Boehner brought up, are you guys convinced that the Border Patrol is not over -- is not being overburdened by this right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s being overburdened by this are actually the immigration courts, right?\xc2\xa0 That that\'s where we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the backlog.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s where you think the burden is?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t feel like it is the Border Patrol itself, that they can still do their regular job on the border in addition to this, handle this as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would say is that our most acute concern right now is the immigration courts, and that the backlog that is building up because of the surge that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen along the southern border.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we are, in fact, surging resources to try to address that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senate Menendez, Democratic Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the idea of you guys trying to find more camps -- essentially detention camps for these children, that there is a more humanitarian way to do this that guarantees that these children do make their court dates.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys looking into alternatives other than putting them in some camps or detention camps, however you want to describe them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.\xc2\xa0 The first is -- what we announced today was detention facilities that could accommodate adults who traveled here with their children.\xc2\xa0 There are also alternatives to detention programs like ankle bracelets that are also being deployed to try to address this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You are deploying?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are.\xc2\xa0 We are.\xc2\xa0 And again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the children?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the children?\xc2\xa0 Or is it specific?\xc2\xa0 Or anybody with the ankle -- are you going to be putting ankle bracelets on this kids?\xc2\xa0 Or on the adults?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the way that these policies are implemented, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DHS for that.\xc2\xa0 But we are looking for a variety of ways to handle what we see is at root a humanitarian problem, but in a way that makes clear this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important, as Jim and I talked about, for people to understand what that law actually is.\xc2\xa0 Because when they show up here, that law is going to be enforced.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the law with these -- since it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- the law says, the United States has to keep them for some time, does it not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, each situation is different.\xc2\xa0 And each is handled on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we want to make sure that we have immigration judges and asylum officers and others who can make sure that these cases are processed efficiently.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when those cases call, as they do in many, many cases for the removal of these individuals back to their home country, that that\'s something that can be executed pretty efficiently and effectively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think this law needs to be changed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we think needs to be changed and reformed is the legal immigration system, that what we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about is that there are a lot of people who do want to follow the law and want to come to this country, but can\'t because the law is so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is different than the immigration law.\xc2\xa0 This has to do with -- this has to do with -- this is not about Mexican immigration.\xc2\xa0 This is not Canadian.\xc2\xa0 This is a separate law.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I asked if you want this law changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the inefficiency of our legal immigration system is not irrelevant here, right, that if we did have a much better functioning legal immigration system, as is contemplated by the current immigration reform proposal, that would contribute to solving this problem?\xc2\xa0 It probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t solve it entirely, but there is more that can be done.\xc2\xa0 And one important step that would at least mitigate this problem a little bit would be passing comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Move around.\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a follow-up on what Chuck was asking because I\xe2\x80\x99m still confused in your response to his question, too.\xc2\xa0 You said the administration response to Chuck is concerned that criminal syndicates are responsible for this surge.\xc2\xa0 And a few minutes before that, your quote was, \xe2\x80\x9cthis deliberate misinformation campaign by criminal syndicates in Central America,\xe2\x80\x9d which made it seem like there was more affirmative evidence.\xc2\xa0 So can you just sort out what made you so firm --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you might be parsing it a little bit too much.\xc2\xa0 What I was trying to say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned that there are individuals, criminals in Central America who are preying upon individual -- vulnerable individuals, spreading this information, and trying to capitalize on their vulnerable position.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about that.\xc2\xa0 We would like to see it put to an end.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of ways that we can do that working with host governments, but also by communicating clearly to the American people, to everybody in this country and to everybody in Central American countries what the law actually is and our commitment to enforcing it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here is what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to ask:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, DHS and Border Security officials and ICE, they are debriefing the youngsters and all these folks, and what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is, are they saying, this is how I came, this is what the information was, this is -- what information do you have to build this case just so that we\xe2\x80\x99re saying, look, this is what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think in terms of the results of debriefs like that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DHS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been given any --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any insight into those kinds of interviews and what information they\xe2\x80\x99ve yielded.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 In the context of dealing with Congress on the Iraq-Syria situation and ISIL, what kind of budgetary implications would the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy announcement yesterday have as we head towards the end of the fiscal year?\xc2\xa0 Have you assessed at all what the costs --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get you some more information about that.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when does the President expect the first teams of Green Berets to arrive in Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For those kinds of operational questions, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense and I think they may be able to provide you some more information about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he has no expectation that it will happen any time soon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he ordered it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He did order it, and the Department of Defense, who is responsible for carrying out that order will be able to provide you with some more details about the time frame in which that order will be carried out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 Let me turn the Maliki question around, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve persistently asked what if he goes.\xc2\xa0 What if he stays?\xc2\xa0 What if that\xe2\x80\x99s the determination, that the politics -- looks for some alternatives and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sort anything out, and Maliki strong arms his way into power and remains there because he did win this third round of elections.\xc2\xa0 Will the U.S. by its very nature have to reassess what it has done so far and what it might be contemplating in its continued relationship with the Iraqi government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hesitant to dive too deeply into a hypothetical about whether or not he stays, but let me try to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s been plenty of rhetoric about the need for an inclusive government and things that obviously take on a different, more inclusive and less divisive chain of events than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Maliki regime so far.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I think I would say about that is simply that it is the view of the United States -- and the President said this yesterday -- that there is not a military solution to the challenges that are posed to the Iraqi government right now; that there may be an opportunity and it may be necessary for the Iraqi security forces to take some steps to stabilize the security situation in the short term.</p>\n<p>But that is only a short-term solution.\xc2\xa0 To get at the root of the enduring problems will require a political effort that\xe2\x80\x99s much more inclusive, that demonstrates to every Iraqi citizen that they have a stake in that country\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 And that will require the pursuit of an inclusive political agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Taking names out of it, absent that process, would the United States have to reassess its relationship with Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the United States is always assessing our relationship with Iraq, and assessing -- most importantly, as the President, again, said yesterday -- are the national security implications of ongoing instability there.\xc2\xa0 There are serious concerns that are raised by the advances that have been made by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Those are concerns that have attracted the attention not just in the United States but other countries in the region, particularly Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors.</p>\n<p>So there is an opportunity for us to work in collaborative fashion with the international community to try to address this problem, and I think that there is pretty widespread agreement that a military solution is not a long-term one, and that it will require, as the President has said, the leaders of Iraq to pursue an inclusive political agenda.</p>\n<p>So that is an effort that we can work with the Iraqis to develop.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one we\xe2\x80\x99ve been encouraging them to pursue.\xc2\xa0 And there is an opportunity for other countries in the region to play a constructive role in encouraging the leaders of Iraq to pursue that inclusive agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the unaccompanied children.\xc2\xa0 It sounds as if what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to say, among the many things you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to articulate about what the administration is now doing, is the presumption will be that these children and their maybe single mothers will not qualify as political refugees or refugees under any definition under U.S. law and that they will, once processed, be sent home.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s misinformation to suggest, as you have identified these various criminal actors, telling them that they can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair interpretation of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying about what the likely outcome of the processing of these unaccompanied children and single mothers is likely to be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s quite right.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the other way around, which is I think that the misinformation that\xe2\x80\x99s being spread is that everybody who shows up on the border, on the southern border, will be allowed to stay.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some will be allowed to stay?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that every person who does show up at that border will go through --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A process.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The immigration process.\xc2\xa0 Some of them may have legitimate, viable asylum claims, and they will go through the asylum process, but the vast majority of them will be detained and removed and that is according to the laws of this country.\xc2\xa0 And that is not the interpretation of the laws that are being shared by these individuals that have very bad intentions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And so the overall goal of these beefed up procedural facilities -- judges, attorneys, asylum advisors -- is to run the people through that process and get them back home?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right, and make sure that justice is administered swiftly and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there was another transition this week and that was the President\xe2\x80\x99s first headlining of a super PAC fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 What is the President doing on the other side of the equation?\xc2\xa0 What is he doing to limit unlimited spending on campaign financing all around the country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s support for campaign finance reform is well known.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, that is support that is not broadly shared on the other side of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s something the President will continue to push for and pursue and support.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve not seen a willing partner on the other side of the aisle at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an opportunity for some pen and phone action when it comes to campaign finance reform?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the President can do without -- there are so many things that you\'re saying he can\'t do, so what can he do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know the answer to that, but if there is, and it\'s one the President decides to choose to pursue, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be among the first to know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it appear that he\xe2\x80\x99s striding confidently in the other direction when he\xe2\x80\x99s headlining a fundraiser for unlimited donations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I think what it demonstrates is that this President is committed to supporting those who share his political agenda in the upcoming elections and that one of the ways that he can help those who support his agenda of expanding economic opportunity for the middle class is to help them raise money.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is doing.\xc2\xa0 But it does not in any way affect his continued and unwavering support for campaign finance reform that would reduce the influence of special interest money in politics and give more citizens a louder voice in a political process.</p>\n<p>And, Mike, I\'m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, thank you.\xc2\xa0 There is a report from Reuter\xe2\x80\x99s that Syria has told the U.N. General Assembly -- I\'m sorry, the Security Council -- that it will consider humanitarian deliveries in the rebel areas as an attack.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration aware of this, and do you have a reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure the administration is aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I personally am not, so we\'ll have to see if we can get you an answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 It may be worth checking with my colleagues in the U.S. Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s Office at the United Nations and they may be able to provide you a more detailed position on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got a note here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A new joke?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you rewrite it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s going to be a while before I try to tell a joke from here again, I\'ll tell you that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the Royals are hot.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got that going for you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They are.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got that going for me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I ask --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think I\'m just going to do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President will participate in the Summit on Working Families to focus on creating a 21st century workplace that works for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 This will be at the Omni Hotel here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, the First Lady and Dr. Biden will also participate.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will host the 2013 President\xe2\x80\x99s Cup teams at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will have lunch with Israeli President Shimon Peres here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Afterward, he\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome Jimmy Johnson to honor him for his 2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was hoping to see (inaudible).</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Dallas Cowboy fans will have to wait for another day for that, I guess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible).</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well -- them, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President will travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota -- I know the White House Chief of Staff is very excited about that trip.\xc2\xa0 And on Friday, we\'ll have a little more detail about the schedule on Friday a little later.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re still working up some details on Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s still overnighting in Minneapolis?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is still the plan.\xc2\xa0 That is still the plan.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a great weekend.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see you on Monday.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:19 P.M.
