EDT</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, thank you for joining us on our trip to Texas.\xc2\xa0 Any questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, I do -- a couple quick questions about today.\xc2\xa0 How does the President view a day like this, in which he spends a lot of his time raising political cash?\xc2\xa0 Does he actually enjoy fundraising, or is this more of just a necessary part of the job?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say the President -- a couple things.\xc2\xa0 For starters, the President is doing a couple different things today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be raising some money.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be talking about the importance of education for our long-term economic outlook.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as it pertains to campaigning, I would say that the President -- what the President does like about it is having the opportunity to go out to the American people and explain the choice that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have this November between some of the policies that the President and Democrats have been putting forward to get our economy back on track, and what the Republicans stand for, which is the same policies that got us into the economic crisis to begin with.</p>\n<p>So he does like talking plainly to the American people about the issues that we face and the choices that they have.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s President of the United States, so every day there\xe2\x80\x99s something new and several different challenges he has to take on, and he takes them on as they come.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for the education speech itself, from the White House perspective, will the education community, will college students hear anything today from the President that they haven\'t heard before?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99ll hear is the President talking about the goal to, by 2020, to get America -- to have America as the country with the largest share of college graduates of any country in the world.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about some of the steps that we\'ve taken to get there, for example, taking $60 billion that would have gone to big banks and lending institutions and putting it towards -- directly towards helping students complete their college educations.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll talk about Race to the Top.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about what we need to do in order to improve community colleges, where a lot of students are getting their higher education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So in that sense, yes, there will be some new things that maybe folks have not heard before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Can we expect the President to make an announcement on Christy Romer\xe2\x80\x99s replacement before he goes to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard?\xc2\xa0 And two, who are the candidates?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s on your short list?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no -- the timeline that we\'re on is that by September 3rd, when Dr. Romer leaves her post is to have that position filled.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have a big say in who gets that position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll have a big say in it?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have a big say.\xc2\xa0 But right now the President is examining candidates and taking a look at who the right person is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\'t expect an announcement before Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard then?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about that necessarily.\xc2\xa0 There won\xe2\x80\x99t be one this week, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Texas visit, what do you make of the fact that Bill White, the nominee for governor, is making himself scarce?\xc2\xa0 What does that say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s coattails and image and popularity?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that it says anything broadly about the President\xe2\x80\x99s coattails.\xc2\xa0 I think it says that Bill White had something else going on today that he would rather do than campaign with the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does the President take that as an insult?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, he thinks that candidates should make their own decisions about how best to spend their time.\xc2\xa0 He definitely does not take that as an insult.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to the Republican argument coming out of Texas that Texas is in such better shape than most of the country because it has lower taxes, lower spending, run by Republicans?\xc2\xa0 I mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not going into friendly political turf today exactly.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, Texas is obviously a great state, one of the greatest states in the country.\xc2\xa0 But like every other state, they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through this economic crisis, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a lot of jobs, which the President is doing everything he can to help create an environment where more jobs are being created.</p>\n<p>They\'re a state that also has had a very tough time with the issue of health insurance.\xc2\xa0 I know it has one of the lowest rates of health insurance in the country.\xc2\xa0 So health insurance reform that the President signed into law this year I know will have a big impact on helping Texans get insured.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I would say that you can have different competing economic philosophies, but the President is doing everything he can to help the Texas economy, just like the United States economy, get back on track.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the President has told Democratic candidates that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do what he can for them, and if you want me by your side, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there with you, but if you want me to stay away, I\xe2\x80\x99ll also stay away.\xc2\xa0 Is he sort of reconciled to the fact that some Democrats like Bill White just really don\'t want to be seen with him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that there has never been a President in the history of this great country who has been wanted by every single candidate across the country to come and campaign for them.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama has said plainly that he is going to go out and be helpful where he can be most helpful and spend his time doing things that are helping Democratic candidates across the country.\xc2\xa0 And in the sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s come to grips with that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a historic fact of life.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how does he balance those needs?\xc2\xa0 Because he\xe2\x80\x99s being helpful by raising money for Democrats in Texas, but he may also, in fact, be hurting the White campaign by showing up there at this time.\xc2\xa0 So how do you sort of balance those competing needs?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is being hurt by the funds that the President is raising for the effort today. The President balances his time by taking a look at a map and seeing where he can be most helpful and when.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President this morning at his event talked about the success of the cement plug.\xc2\xa0 Who is briefing him?\xc2\xa0 Did he receive his briefings over the weekend or this morning on the cement plug?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He -- I missed the last part of your question, but if I don\xe2\x80\x99t answer it just let me know.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed regularly by Carol Browner and other staff, and he continues to receive updates every single day even on the weekends.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Was there any other part to your question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, a food-related Gulf question.\xc2\xa0 Number one, he -- there\xe2\x80\x99s two events where they\xe2\x80\x99ve served seafood from the Gulf -- the shrimp last night and then I guess po\xe2\x80\x99 boys at an event today.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us like where exactly those two things came from?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I had that same question and I\xe2\x80\x99m tracking it down.\xc2\xa0 I will let you know as soon as I hear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update on who will head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Senator Dodd last week saying that Elizabeth Warren will cause a fight if she\xe2\x80\x99s the nominee?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, for starters, I would say that there is no update on the timing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But in terms of Senator Dodd, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve litigated what he has had to say, and a lot of folks have opinions about Elizabeth Warren and other candidates.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view that Elizabeth Warren would be confirmable.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect an announcement before -- again, before he goes to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Check back at the beginning of next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And of the actions of North Korea firing 110 rounds of ammo in disputed waters, any White House reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the President wants to make sure that everybody is doing what they can to make sure that region is stable and there\xe2\x80\x99s security for folks all over the region.\xc2\xa0 But on that particular incident, no, not particularly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to have a brief conversation with Governor Perry about border security.\xc2\xa0 What is he going to tell the governor, and does he feel like -- that enough is being done to secure the border?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 For starters, the President has done -- the President has put more assets on the border to secure the border than has ever previously been there.\xc2\xa0 That includes National Guard troops, technology, things he has done on enforcement.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that he is working very hard on.</p>\n<p>I think that -- you know these tarmac greets with elected officials, Governor Perry will be there.\xc2\xa0 It will probably be a very brief conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not a substantive conversation of an issue of tremendous importance to border states?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is something the President has been working hard on.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in contact with Governor Perry. I know that our staff has contacted him for meetings and briefings to discuss the matter, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we will continue to work on with them.\xc2\xa0 Today, the schedule just didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any other announcements for Texas, anything specific?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting for U.S. Attorneys.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, nothing in particular on that, not at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the holdup?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the delegation on the appropriate nominees.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last question.\xc2\xa0 In some of his fundraising speeches, the President has been quite critical of George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 Can we expect him to criticize the former President today again on his home turf?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President on a lot of the messages that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in the past about the kind of policies that he and Democrats have been promoting, and about what Republicans have been promoting, which are some of the same policies that got us into the situation that we\xe2\x80\x99re in right now. So I don\'t think that there will be a marked difference from what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in some of the other events.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why no meeting with President Bush?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a couple of miles away.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You know -- I think that the President will obviously see him at some point in the future.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there was a request for a meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department says negotiations with BP had been completed to establish the $20 billion fund.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details on those arrangements?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some more details this morning, maybe even happening on the ground right now, but I would check in with the Department of Justice on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything you could tell us?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill White had suggested that if the President wants to talk to him he can call him.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans to call Bill White, or has he called him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There are no plans to call him, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And can you talk a little bit about why the choice of education as the topic today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Education is a critically important issue as it relates to the competitiveness of our country with other countries.\xc2\xa0 And as the President has said before, people who out-educate us today are going to out-compete us tomorrow, and we simply are not going to be in a position where the United States is falling behind other countries as it relates to higher education.\xc2\xa0 So the President thinks this is an important economic issue, and thought it was important to talk about it today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, is there a feeling that it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten kind of lost in the shuffle with all the talk we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this year about health care reform and financial regulatory reform, that people haven\xe2\x80\x99t been paying attention?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things that the President focuses on every single day that the average American probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to pick up the newspaper and read about every single thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 And reporters don\xe2\x80\x99t even have time to cover all the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing every single day.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re respectful of the fact that people are busy and average Americans are trying to get their bills paid on time, get their kids ready for school in the fall, and this is just an opportunity for the President to talk about something that\'s very important to him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n10:41 A.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
