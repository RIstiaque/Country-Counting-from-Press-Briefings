Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>2:00 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House for the first briefing of December, at least from this podium.\xc2\xa0 And I hope everyone here had a terrific Thanksgiving holiday and was able to spend time with friends and family.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 There were some reports over the weekend from administration officials on the status of the healthcare.gov website, basically indicating that the worst of the problems are over but there are still other problems in the system.\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable with the level that the website is operating at, at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the site has been significantly improved and that the teams in place have worked 24/7 for weeks now to make those improvements, including significant improvements that were made over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 But the work is not done.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for some time, there would be continued issues that we needed to address and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But with the improvements that were made and discussed by Jeff Zients over the weekend, we believe that this website is and will function effectively for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 And each day, we will continue to take steps to make further improvements so that that experience is enhanced for users every day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Insurers are saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem still on the back end where, for those folks that are actually able to enroll, the information that the insurance companies are getting is garbled, incomplete, in some cases totally unusable.\xc2\xa0 Can the administration assure people who have been able to enroll that they will, in fact, have coverage beginning on January 1st?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked me that question.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of things I want to say about that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we are very mindful of making sure that consumers who want coverage starting in January are able to get it.\xc2\xa0 And CMS is reaching out directly to consumers who have already selected a plan to let them know to be in touch with their plan to pay their first premium to ensure that coverage kicks in and know that plans are working hard to make sure their new customers are covered as well.\xc2\xa0 So this is a joint effort to reach out to those who have enrolled to make sure that every step is being -- that they know they need to take all the necessary steps to ensure that that coverage kicks in.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, CMS is having daily conversations with issuers to get feedback from them.\xc2\xa0 We have instituted a number of significant fixes to the so-called 834 forms, which are these -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the vehicle by which information is transmitted to the issuers.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the majority of fixes to 834 forms have been made, including significant ones that were made over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 We expect the info now sent to insurers to be vastly improved.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with issuers to make sure that whatever remaining problems exist are addressed and fixed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can assure folks that have signed up or will sign up through December 23rd that they will definitely have coverage beginning on January 1st?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would say is that CMS is reaching out to those who have enrolled to make sure that they know the steps that they need to take to ensure that coverage kicks in.\xc2\xa0 If a consumer enrolls in a plan by December 23rd and makes their first payment by the date set by their insurer, they are covered beginning January 1st.\xc2\xa0 And if consumers are not sure if they are enrolled, they should call our customer call center or the insurer of their choice so that they can be sure they\xe2\x80\x99re covered by January 1st.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re making -- this is a high priority, making sure that those who are enrolled are aware of the steps that they need to take, including that they need to pay their premiums on time for coverage.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with insurers to make sure that those who are enrolled know this information.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re reaching out -- or we\xe2\x80\x99re telling consumers that if they\xe2\x80\x99re not sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re enrolled, they should call the call center or their insurer directly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask quickly about the dispute in the East China Sea.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden is in Asia right now visiting Japan and China.\xc2\xa0 Is he carrying any kind of message from the White House in terms of this dispute and what the President would like to see from both sides?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is on a long-planned trip to Asia that includes several countries.\xc2\xa0 And while a number of issues will be raised in the discussions he\xe2\x80\x99ll, have given the increase in regional tensions, the ADIZ that China announced will be an issue the Vice President will raise.\xc2\xa0 He has an excellent relationship with the leaders of all three countries, and he will underscore how important it is to avoid actions that raise tensions and to prevent miscalculations that could undermine peace, security, and prosperity in the region.</p>\n<p>This is an opportunity for Vice President Biden to raise our concerns directly with policymakers in Beijing and to seek clarity regarding the Chinese intentions in making this move at this time.\xc2\xa0 It is also an opportunity to confer with our allies Japan and the Republic of Korea, both of whom are directly affected by China\xe2\x80\x99s actions.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, along those lines, North Korea is holding this 85-year-old American, Edward Newman.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any progress toward getting him released?\xc2\xa0 And is this something the Vice President is going to raise on the trip?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are deeply concerned about the welfare of the U.S. citizens held in custody in the DPRK.\xc2\xa0 Kenneth Bae has been in North Korea custody -- North Korean custody for over a year, and we continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant him amnesty and immediate release.\xc2\xa0 We also urge the immediate release of Merrill Newman, who was detained more recently.\xc2\xa0 Given Mr. Newman\xe2\x80\x99s advanced age and health conditions, we urge the DPRK to release Mr. Newman so he may return home and reunite with his family.</p>\n<p>Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an itemized list of topics of discussion for the Vice President, but in addition to all the important issues that we discuss with the governments of the countries he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that those that are getting a lot of attention right now will be among those issues discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then back on health care for a second, the queuing system has been activated.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why was this done?\xc2\xa0 And how much has traffic exceeded capacity on the website?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One of the improvements that has been made since October 1st was the improvement to the queuing system.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely anticipated that on this day in particular, because it is the first workday after the deadline we set for ourselves to make sure that the website was functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, we would see a surge in visitors to the website.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific numbers for you, but I can tell you that we are seeing that surge, and I believe the -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to CMS to give more detail.\xc2\xa0 I believe that something on the order of 375,000 visitors had gone to healthcare.gov by noon today -- 375,000, which is obviously a large number.</p>\n<p>One of the fixes that has been made was the new queuing system, the improved queuing system, so that when we saw a surge in users, we would have a means by which individuals who are interested in enrolling would get information about when they can return to the site and enroll more effectively and efficiently, and that way make the whole operation more effective and smooth.</p>\n<p>Even for those visitors who aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to buy a plan or enroll in a plan, they can avail themselves of a new option that is available now, which is an improved window shopping tool which will allow them, in greater detail, to -- April, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.\xc2\xa0 You look very puzzled, as does Anita.\xc2\xa0 But the new window-shopping tool, the upgraded window-shopping tool will allow visitors to get more detail about the options available to them, and they can do that without enrolling and therefore would not have to get in a queue if they are trying to enroll in a surge period like we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing today.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is today sort of a cyber Monday for healthcare.gov?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is that I certainly will hope to avail myself at some point today of cyber Monday, anyway, to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you get home.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- when I get home, to begin to make some holiday purchases.\xc2\xa0 But look, what we have said all along about the November 30th, December 1st, December 2nd deadline is that this was a marker along the road towards the progress we need to make.\xc2\xa0 That by November 30th, December 1st, we would see the system -- the healthcare.gov website working effectively for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 But the work is not done, and it will continue.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to make improvements.\xc2\xa0 We continue to have folks working around the clock on the site to make it more and more effective every day.</p>\n<p>And what I was trying to say, and Josh and others were trying to say, including the President, in the days and weeks leading up to this deadline is that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t all happen at once; that those improvements were being made every day.\xc2\xa0 And we saw those improvements affect positively the user experience every day through November.</p>\n<p>So I think that we\'re not done with the work that needs to be done on that website, but we have I think passed an important milestone when it comes to making it work effectively for the vast majority of users.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on that note, if you go to the website periodically throughout the day today, and you hit the \xe2\x80\x9clogin\xe2\x80\x9d button or if you go to the \xe2\x80\x9capply online\xe2\x80\x9d button, it does take you to that screen where you\'re asked to leave an email and come back later.\xc2\xa0 That seems to be coming up almost every hour that I\xe2\x80\x99ve checked it all day long.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure a lot of journalists are checking it today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the volume, it\'s probably not affecting it that much.\xc2\xa0 But I just want to -- I mean, is that going to be acceptable if that\'s the norm for a lot of people for an extended period of time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I think is important to note is that the queuing system, the more sophisticated, improved queuing system is a feature designed to improve the user experience; that when we talked about concurrent users it was always going to be the case, as we anticipated, that on a day like today we would see a surge beyond even the vastly improved capacity levels that are the result of the changes that have been made and fixes that have been made.\xc2\xa0 And what was important -- and we talked about this before November 30th -- is that we have a queuing system made for a better user experience so that individuals could get in that queue, could be notified when was the best time to return to healthcare.gov and enroll, if they so desired.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, among the other improvements made to the site is an improved and more sophisticated window-shopping tool, which Americans who are only at the stage now of looking at the options available to them can avail themselves of without enrolling and without -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re visiting a site during a surge period, without having to get in a queue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday -- on a conference call yesterday, Jeffrey Zients seemed to take issue with the management structure and style that had been in place in guiding healthcare.gov to its launch.\xc2\xa0 Was he talking about Secretary Sebelius?\xc2\xa0 Who was he talking about when he seemed to question the way that that process was being managed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what Jeff has been tasked with doing and is working on every day is improving the management of the healthcare.gov operation, and focusing specifically on the teams that are making the fixes necessary to the website.\xc2\xa0 And that work has been ongoing and it has delivered significant improvements.</p>\n<p>What I\'m sure Jeff was also referring to is something that we\'ve all been quite candid about:\xc2\xa0 The website did not function nearly up to standards that were necessary come October 1st, and it should have.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s on us.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'ve dedicated the resources and brainpower that we have to fixing it, because this is all about the goal we set with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which is that millions of Americans need to be able to avail themselves of quality, affordable health insurance, for many of them for the first time, or the first time in many, many years.</p>\n<p>And we focus on that, and healthcare.gov and the other avenues by which you can enroll are means to that end.\xc2\xa0 But it is absolutely our responsibility to make sure that that website, which is an important part of the process of getting those Americans who want quality, affordable health insurance enrolled works effectively.\xc2\xa0 And Jeff has been an important part of that effort since he came onboard to do this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify the 375,000 really fast?\xc2\xa0 The three -- well, the four of us now are kind of confused.\xc2\xa0 Is it just for today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, by noon today, 375,000 visitors to the site.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Starting with when?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that is today\xe2\x80\x99s figure, not today\xe2\x80\x99s and yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 But CMS will be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s figure.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s figure.\xc2\xa0 So that is just today.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From midnight on to 12 noon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 So I believe CMS will be briefing and will have more information available, but I was given that before I came out to give you a sense of the volume that we\'re seeing -- which, again, we anticipated, which is why it was so important to put in place the queuing system, because I know those are just visitors, but there are obviously those who are trying to and want to enroll, and we want to make sure that their experience is vastly improved and that if they are trying to enroll during a surge period, that they are given the information they need to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re in a queue and can come back to the site at a time when it will be more effective and efficient for them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 But that\'s vastly more than they say they can handle in a day, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the day figure was 800,000 I believe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 800,000.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so you expect the surge, that\'s a one-day thing, or you think it will --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to CMS for what their expectations are for numbers.\xc2\xa0 We always expected today to be a big day and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why the queuing system, if that\'s far smaller than the 800,000?\xc2\xa0 See what I\'m saying?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there are visitors to the site and there are those who are trying to enroll in the site.\xc2\xa0 You can go and visit and shop.\xc2\xa0 You can spend a little time on it, you can spend a long time on it.\xc2\xa0 But if you register and select a plan, thereby enrolling, that activates a different part of the system and that is where you would get in the queue -- not to visit, but to enroll.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So 375,000 in the queue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, April.\xc2\xa0 375,000 visitors to the website.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, first, another numbers question.\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that 100,000, roughly, were able to enroll in the month of November, about four times the month of October.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specific data.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of things that, as we saw in the previous month, that HHS needs to scrub and collect and gather.\xc2\xa0 What I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ballpark?\xc2\xa0 Is that roughly four times --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I simply would urge you to wait until we have hard data from HHS and CMS.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that improvements were made to the website throughout the month of November, as we discussed, and I would expect that the numbers who successfully enrolled in November would exceed the numbers who successfully enrolled in October.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a hard figure for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the goal that you set for this moment in time, of the website being functional for the vast majority of users, is it mission accomplished?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I was saying, Jon, we were working very hard to make the necessary fixes to improve the website so that by December 1st it would function effectively for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 The metrics we used to measure that have to do with response time and stability of the site and the error rate, and I know that Jeff and others who do the CMS briefings have gone into those metrics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we believe we made the important progress that we set out to make by November 30th, but as we said in November and I\'ve said just now, the work continues to make improvements that still need to be made to the website.\xc2\xa0 And the focus here is not on -- the endgame here isn\'t the best possible and most effective website that we can build, but a system by which all those millions of Americans who are clearly interested in enrolling and purchasing quality, affordable health insurance are able to do so.</p>\n<p>So that\'s our goal, and that work continues today.\xc2\xa0 We have passed an important milestone in that effort, but the work continues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just try to crystallize that down, because we tried to pin you down on what \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d means and you guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to quantify it.\xc2\xa0 Just very clearly, in terms of the goal you set for this moment in time, is it mission accomplished? Have you accomplished that goal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Using that phrase is not one I would employ.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is what Jeff said, is that we were able to make the necessary improvements to the website so that the vast majority of Americans who use the website have an experience in which the site functions effectively.\xc2\xa0 It does not mean -- as I know I said in November and October -- it does not mean that there will be no problems with the website going forward.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even occur on the most highly functional private sector websites.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what it does mean is that we\'ve made significant progress, we\'ve made the improvements to the system that we hoped we could, and that more work continues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how do you explain that for most of the day so far people that have tried to get on have gotten that message that the website is too crowded?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think I noted the number of people who have visited the website just up to noon today.\xc2\xa0 We completely anticipated and I know telegraphed that we would see surges in the number of visitors and the number of people trying to enroll, especially on a day like today.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we built that queuing system, so that we would improve the experience of those users who visited the site over what they experienced back in October when the website was not functioning effectively for the vast majority of users, and those who were trying to get in weren\'t being queued up through a sophisticated system that allowed them to return to the site at a time when it would function more efficiently for them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you say to those -- because we\'ve talked to some today that we\'ve been tracking from the start of this -- who still went on yesterday and today, and still are unable to enroll?\xc2\xa0 What do you say to them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would say that we have seen steady improvement in the site, and that improvement continued over the weekend and today.\xc2\xa0 What is absolutely the case is that we need to continue our work, and that while the vast majority of users are able to access the site and have it function effectively, on a day like today when you have a surge that we\'re likely seeing, you\'re going to get this queue message, potentially, if you\'re trying to enroll, which allows for you to return to the site when it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be less crowded.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a vast improvement over the experience that people had during surge periods -- or any period, really -- in early October.</p>\n<p>Separately, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, because, again\xc2\xa0 -- and this goes back to some of the confusion -- there are visitors to the site and there are those who are trying to enroll potentially, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also the issue of how many overall visitors to the site over a certain period of time -- a day or a half a day -- versus the number of visitors at a given moment, which is what generates the queue message.</p>\n<p>So you\xe2\x80\x99re able to window shop using a much more sophisticated tool than you were in the past, and we are confident that the number of people who are successfully navigating the system is improving and has improved significantly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last question.\xc2\xa0 Your predecessor, Robert Gibbs, as you probably saw, said --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Had a great day on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He says -- well, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, he did -- it will be inexplicable if somebody --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t score the touchdown.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it felt like he did.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Mr. Gibbs says, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be inexplicable if somebody involved in the creation of the website doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get fired or a group of people don\xe2\x80\x99t get fired.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, what I would say is that we are focused on -- and I know that Robert said this also in that interview -- that it is important to focus right now on making the necessary fixes to the website so that it functions effectively for the vast majority of users, and that we continue to make those fixes so that improvements continue to be made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Issues on personnel are not something that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now when it comes to making the Affordable Care Act work for the American people.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that millions of Americans who so clearly are interested, in significant numbers, in the access provided to them by the Affordable Care Act to quality, affordable health insurance are able to get it.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in past weeks remains true today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on -- not on Monday-morning quarterbacking.\xc2\xa0 I think the President noted, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and look at this period and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that he tops the list among those individuals who are frustrated by the failures that we saw with healthcare.gov and its launch.\xc2\xa0 But right now, he wants his team focused on making improvements for the American people who, again, as today is evidence of, are so clearly interested in this quality, affordable health insurance.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While the President was on the West Coast last week, the White House called in several allies in the enrollment campaign for the health care law, and said, next week, don\xe2\x80\x99t pursue a big advertising or enrollment push because we\xe2\x80\x99re not quite ready.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that speak to, though the site is improved, it\xe2\x80\x99s still core fragility?\xc2\xa0 That even though people who support the law want to get people enrolled, who are ready to launch a public relations campaign to help you get people enrolled, were instructed by this White House, \xe2\x80\x9cHold off because we\xe2\x80\x99re not ready yet\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as the numbers that I cited earlier in this briefing demonstrate, our issue is not with the number of people who have demonstrated their interest in coming to the website and potentially enrolling and getting covered.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on making sure that that process works for the many, many Americans who are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These people want to make it work.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and so do we.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they have lots of people they want to communicate with --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that in the first week of December --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to say, \xe2\x80\x9cGo to the website,\xe2\x80\x9d and you\xe2\x80\x99re still saying -- even with all this happy talk, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do it yet because it\xe2\x80\x99s not ready yet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know what, Major?\xc2\xa0 For the 375,000 people who visited the site by noon today, I think that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need an advertising campaign to visit.\xc2\xa0 We firmly believed and expected that, in this period in particular, we would see many, many Americans looking at their options and enrolling.\xc2\xa0 And so our focus is on not trying to advertise and get more Americans to do that, because we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing those Americans show up already with a demonstrated interest.\xc2\xa0 Our focus is on making sure the website works as effectively as possible, and that the other means that they have available to them to enroll are working as effectively as possible in this critical time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for Families USA or labor unions or other groups, Enroll America, to do anything to advocate for people to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that -- and this goes to your question -- that on December 2nd and this week, we do not see a need to inform people of the fact that they can go to the website and look at their options and enroll.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What they need is a functional website.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What they need is a functional website that can handle large capacity and help them get enrolled, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Major, the website -- and I would point you to the briefings, the many briefings that Jeff Zients and others have given -- as originally designed and as we\xe2\x80\x99re targeting for this period, so that it was actually functioning as effectively as it was supposed to function on October 1st, had numbers associated with concurrent users and total visitors in a day that we believe we can achieve.\xc2\xa0 But surge periods were always going to exceed that, which is why it was important to make the improvements to the queuing system that we made.</p>\n<p>So in a week like this, when we expect heightened interest, and heightened interest demonstrated by the number of visitors to the website and the number of people trying to enroll, we believe that -- and I think the numbers are bearing us out -- that the focus this week ought to be on making sure that those systems work as effectively as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me pick up on that last sentence -- the heightened interest this week.\xc2\xa0 People who are close to the website and also on the projections that you made internally view not this week, not next week, but two weeks from now is a real crucial period of time, because they believe -- and the Massachusetts experience reminds them of this -- that for those who want coverage by January 1st, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to be an even bigger surge than we saw today or likely to see this week from people probably from December 15th to December 23rd, the final deadline if you want your coverage to be effective on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have this site ready not just for this week but for what\xe2\x80\x99s projected even internally here to be even larger numbers of people who are not going to be sort of visiting the site, but needing to get that coverage so they have it on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 Are you confident, is the President confident that the website is going to be ready for that expected and projected surge of people?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are confident that we\'ve achieved significant improvement in the website and its functionality, as measured by the metrics that we\'ve gone over thus far, and that we will continue to make progress and improvements to the website in the days and weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>So you\'re absolutely right that for those who want coverage on January 1st, they need to have enrolled by December 23rd and obviously to have paid their premium by the deadline set by their insurer.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m told this is going to be the biggest spike that this administration will have seen in people coming to the website and seeking coverage -- bigger than they would see now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That may be the case, but I would refer you to the CMS briefings for what they might have about their expectations.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s always been the case, as we\'ve anticipated this even prior to the problems that we had with the website, that you would see relatively small levels of enrollment in the first month -- in our case, it was much smaller even than the levels expected because of the problems with the site -- and that those numbers would increase and that they would increase significantly as we approach certain deadlines.\xc2\xa0 December 23rd is one; March 31st is another.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that that period and the usability of the site and the functionality and whether people can get what they need by December 23rd will be the next biggest test of this entire process?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would certainly agree that that is an important period, that all these days in December are important and every day from now until March 31st is important, to make sure that everybody out there who wants to enroll and then purchase quality, affordable health insurance is able to do so.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s on us to make sure that they have the means and the tools necessary to do that.</p>\n<p>So that\'s why we\'re continuing to work; that\'s why we continue to make improvements and changes that we\'ve made.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the improvements made thus far have been significant, that the website as it functions today is vastly improved over what it was on launch day.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to continue to work every day to make sure that the experiences for users is as good as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On China, real quickly -- what does the administration think is at stake right now?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since there\xe2\x80\x99s been any kind of even low-level sense of potential military misunderstanding, military confusion, military confrontation with China.\xc2\xa0 What is at stake in this situation right now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that the United States remains deeply concerned that China announced the establishment of an East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone -- that\'s the ADIZ I mentioned earlier.\xc2\xa0 This appears to be a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea, and thus raises regional tensions and increases the risk of miscalculation, confrontation, and accidents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are consulting and coordinating closely with Japan, the Republic of Korea and our friends and allies in the region.\xc2\xa0 China announced the ADIZ without prior consultations even though the newly announced ADIZ overlaps with parts of the longstanding ADIZs of Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, and includes territory administered by Japan.</p>\n<p>We do not accept the legitimacy of China\xe2\x80\x99s requirements for operating in the newly declared ADIZ.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that China\xe2\x80\x99s announcement has caused confusion and increased the risk of accidents only further underscores the validity of our concerns and the need for China to rescind the procedures.</p>\n<p>As we have repeatedly said and our actions have demonstrated, we believe that these kinds of provocations create risk of miscalculation, and we don\'t accept the legitimacy of what China announced.\xc2\xa0 So the Vice President is in the region, as you know, holding important meetings, and we\'re obviously consulting --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he carrying that specific message you just read?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Directly to Chinese leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you square that with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation that some of the civilian aircraft identify and go through the procedures that China has now requested, even though it does not recognize and considers this ADIZ invalid?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 For safety and security of passengers, U.S. carriers operating internationally operate consistent with notices to airmen issued by foreign countries.\xc2\xa0 However -- and let me be clear -- this in no way indicates U.S. government acceptance of China\xe2\x80\x99s requirement in the newly declared ADIZ, and has absolutely no bearing on the firm and consistent U.S. government position that we do not accept the legitimacy of China\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.\xc2\xa0 This is about the safety and security of passengers; it is not an indication of any change in our position.\xc2\xa0 We do not accept the legitimacy of China\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to go back to health care.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet the deadline, the more I listen to your answers, because Ezekiel Emanuel yesterday said the website is working \xe2\x80\x9creasonably well;\xe2\x80\x9d you say it\xe2\x80\x99s vastly improved, there\xe2\x80\x99s been significant progress, but not necessarily that it\xe2\x80\x99s working well and effectively for the vast majority of users, as you acknowledged what Jim and Jon and Major and others have said that people going on, they\xe2\x80\x99re still getting the same error messages they got three days ago.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re confusing error messages with the queuing message, which is quite a different thing entirely.\xc2\xa0 The queue message is a specific tool that was upgraded and improved to be more sophisticated so that when there were surges in traffic on the website and when the number of users reached a certain level that people would get those messages that they were placed in a queue, that if they wanted to enroll there was a better time for them to come back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but they\xe2\x80\x99re still not enrolling.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re in a different line now, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, Ed, I contest that and I would ask you to find anywhere where I said that everybody would be able to enroll instantly on this day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the goal then?\xc2\xa0 Just to keep moving them into other lines?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the goal is obviously to enroll more people, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And those people who want to enroll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if they\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I would point you to the fact that more people are visiting the site and are able to effectively go from beginning to end when it comes to enrolling than was the case in October and in November.\xc2\xa0 Significant improvements have been made, and the vast majority of users we believe are able to use the website and have it function effectively for them.</p>\n<p>That does not mean and we never said it would mean that there would be no problems moving forward, that there would never be an error message or a delayed response for a page to load.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly not the case with even the most high-functioning commercial websites of complexity and size.\xc2\xa0 But what our goal is, is to make sure that we continue to improve the overall experience, because the purpose here is to make sure that Americans have access to quality and affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And the healthcare.gov site is an important part of that; it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only part.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re continuing to work every day to make the improvements that are necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question.\xc2\xa0 You compare it to the private sector. The progress report put out by the administration over the weekend said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe team is operating with private sector velocity and effectiveness now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Can you reasonably expect that it\xe2\x80\x99s working to that effectiveness, according to the administration, with, by your own estimation, 24/7, bringing in outside consultants?\xc2\xa0 Is it reasonable to expect that you can keep that same level of private sector velocity and effectiveness, as you call it, over the next months, years, as it\xe2\x80\x99s really the government doing it, not the private sector?\xc2\xa0 This is a government operation and it was not obviously working before.\xc2\xa0 You now say it\xe2\x80\x99s working with private sector velocity.\xc2\xa0 Can you reasonably keep up that pace in the days ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The answer is, yes, we can, in the days ahead, continue to work around the clock, as we have in recent days and weeks, to make the necessary improvements.\xc2\xa0 Two, what is absolutely the case is that the private sector does some things very well and better than the government can, and running effective websites may be one of them, is one of them.\xc2\xa0 What the Affordable Care Act demonstrates is that it is important for government to take action in order to, for example, do something the private sector has failed to do, which is reduce the inflation rate in health care costs.</p>\n<p>What we saw prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act was enormous increases annually in the amount of money that this country spends on health care.\xc2\xa0 And what we have seen since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, contradicting every prediction made by Republicans who opposed to it, is that the costs of health care and the growth in those costs have been declining.\xc2\xa0 And that is a significant goal set by the Affordable Care Act and a significant achievement over these three years.\xc2\xa0 These three years have seen the lowest growth in health care costs of any time in the past half-century.</p>\n<p>So we\'re going to keep -- I mean, it goes to the -- I think the heart of the matter is, was the launch of the website unsuccessful?\xc2\xa0 The answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 Was it absolutely our responsibility to take every measure necessary to make the fixes we could make so that that website functioned more effectively for the Americans who want -- they don\'t want an effective website; they want health insurance.\xc2\xa0 They want affordable, quality coverage.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re working to achieve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point, long term, not the short-term squabbles now with Republicans -- David Plouffe on Sunday was talking about the subject of Medicaid expansion, and he said -- again, he was talking about Medicaid, not necessarily the -- \xe2\x80\x9cIt may take until 2017, when this President leaves office.\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to see almost every state running their own exchanges, expanding Medicaid, and I think it will work really well then.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that sort of the long-term goal here, that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take years?\xc2\xa0 This is not months in terms of not just Medicaid --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when it comes to Medicaid expansion, I think that David made an important point, which is based on the decision allowed by the Supreme Court ruling of a number of Republican governors to cut their constituents out of the possibility of getting covered through Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 And what we have seen is a number of Republican governors make the decision against the ideological advice of their counterparts to expand Medicaid coverage for their constituents in Ohio, in Florida and Arizona and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what I think David Plouffe was saying is that because of the wisdom of that choice for those constituents, that eventually -- and I don\'t think 2017 is that far in the distance when we\'re talking about the number of states that still need to make the decision to expand -- that eventually that decision will be made even by Republican governors, because there are millions of Americans who are being left out of the possibility of getting covered by Medicaid because of that very political ideological decision some Republican governors made.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re continuing to work with states to urge them to provide that benefit to their constituents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are, as you know, other Democrats saying they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see improvement by 2014.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got a big election coming up.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you noted in your question that we\'re talking about Medicaid and expansion --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Medicaid is critical to turn the corner on this whole thing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what David was saying.\xc2\xa0 We were going to see -- we have seen improvements.\xc2\xa0 And I think that if you talk to Democrats who are as frustrated as we are with the way the launch of the website began, they would also say that there have been significant improvements in the functionality of the website and that we passed an important milestone on November 30th.</p>\n<p>But that work continues, and we\'re going to see those improvements continue over the course of December and into next year, because as I think someone noted earlier -- Major -- about the deadlines that we\'re looking at, we\'re looking at making sure that those Americans who want insurance through the exchanges have it if they want it by January 1st, and also that everybody who wants to enroll during the six-month enrollment period is able to do so by March 31st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I promise that beginning tomorrow I\'ll do the back again.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, for those in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Knowing that we\'ve discussed these last -- you can be succinct in some of your answers to these, but just to make clear that I understand some things -- the 375,000 number that you brought to us today, do you have any sense of what number of those people actually were able to get through the site as far as they wanted versus had to queue?\xc2\xa0 Because many of the people in this row, I guess, as they discussed, who have tried, were among those who had to queue.\xc2\xa0 So 375,000 got to do whatever they wanted, or just checked out the site?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to CMS.\xc2\xa0 That is an overall visitors to the website figure, which I think simply demonstrates the level of interest today, which we anticipated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll ask CMS.\xc2\xa0 In the document, as Ed just referred to, it says that the tech team is able to work with private sector velocity and effectiveness.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that in the very language that they used a concession or an indictment of the way government works, that we\'re now -- only now able to achieve something similar to what the private sector does?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an assessment of how the website worked on October 1st and that what Jeff Zients and those he\xe2\x80\x99s working with set out to achieve by November 30th was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he said the tech team is working at that level.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the website is working at private sector velocity.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the tech team is working on the website.\xc2\xa0 And I think as somebody with a huge amount of experience in the private sector, Jeff is able to make the assessment that he did -- that we have a team that he\xe2\x80\x99s managing, or helping manage, that is working at peak effectiveness, if you will.\xc2\xa0 And because of that, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make some of the improvements that we wanted to make and will continue to work to make sure that this experience for those millions of Americans who want quality, affordable health insurance continues to improve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CBO set a number by March 31st -- 7 million uninsured Americans would be able to sign up.\xc2\xa0 That was their projection.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your projection; it was their projection, but still ultimately from this administration.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that that number right now is still attainable?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that was CBO\xe2\x80\x99s projection, not ours.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that we put a numerical projection on what we hope to see by March 31st.\xc2\xa0 I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is your number still attainable?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our goal is to make sure that everybody who wants to enroll through the exchanges is able to do so during the open enrollment period, and that we believe those numbers will be sufficient and that the pool of people who enroll will be of the necessary diversity to make sure that the ACA works as envisioned -- and that the exchanges, rather, work as envisioned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I would -- for some of these numerical questions, the CMS briefing might be a better place to go.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that as we continue to see improvements and we continue to see Americans successfully register and enroll, that we will begin to make the progress necessary towards the kind of population of people who are going to avail themselves of insurance on the exchanges that we hoped.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, I want to get your thoughts.\xc2\xa0 Senator Dianne Feinstein said when asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre we safer now than we were a year ago, or even two years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think terror is up worldwide.\xc2\xa0 The statistics indicate that.\xc2\xa0 The fatalities are way up.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 She went on and on.\xc2\xa0 I just want to get a sense from you right now if you disagree with that statement.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that statement, but I can tell you that we share with Senator Feinstein and every other lawmaker who focuses on these issues the belief that we need to be intensely vigilant as a nation in making sure that we\'re doing everything we can to protect ourselves against those who would do us harm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to be clear, are we safer?\xc2\xa0 In your perspective --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t think that that work is ever done, Peter, and that every day that we succeed in thwarting potential attacks against American interests, Americans, our allies is important, but that that work never ends and we are ever vigilant as we combat the many threats that this country faces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House has indicated that when Jeff Zients moves to his NEC post that someone would succeed him in the role of heading up healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us what the White House is looking for in Zients\xe2\x80\x99s successor and whether that person would report directly to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The role, as I understand it, that Jeff has played and continues to play will be filled when he leaves and, as you noted, will take over as Director of the NEC -- because the President believes and Secretary Sebelius believes that that is an important role, and that we have seen in the way that Jeff has worked in that role that that kind of management position needs to be filled even after he comes over to the White House.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have -- I believe that Jeff works for CMS in his current arrangement, so I don\'t have any information on what the structure of that will look like for that position moving forward.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that it will look any different than it does today.\xc2\xa0 But it is correct that it is the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s intention and the President\xe2\x80\x99s intention that that role continue to be filled after Jeff leaves.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has a decision been made to delay Jeff Zients\xe2\x80\x99s movement from the website special assignment to the White House, to the NEC?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that there was a specific end date on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that Jeff will come to the White House early next year, and that when he does, that position that he\xe2\x80\x99s filling now will be filled by a successor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I noticed that last week, President Obama and you today, and even Josh, were avoiding using the word \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that now -- you\xe2\x80\x99re avoiding that reference?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think, in fact, after the initial stories about that, I came out and talked about Obamacare several times. So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you did.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But nobody is using the word anymore.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which word was it, Mark?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I was helping a colleague.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see this somewhere.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that -- I know I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with calling it Obamacare, the President is fine with it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on making sure that the \xe2\x80\x9ccare\xe2\x80\x9d part is delivered to the Americans who want it.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare or anything else, what matters to the President is that the benefits available to every American who gets covered, either through the exchanges or has coverage already, are delivered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that already millions of millions of Americans, every one of us who has insurance coverage, already has benefits from the Affordable Care Act -- from Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 That if you have a child between 18 and 26, that child is now able to stay on your insurance coverage, whereas before he or she was not.\xc2\xa0 There are benefits when it comes to the inability now of insurers, because of the Affordable Care Act, to throw you off a plan or deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p>And the list of existing benefits and benefits that will kick in once the exchanges kicks in is long.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the care, and we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on making sure that the Americans -- the millions of Americans who clearly want affordable, quality health insurance are able to get access to it and purchase it.</p>\n<p>Yes, Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an updated estimate on how much it has cost thus far to build and to fix healthcare.gov?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to ask CMS.\xc2\xa0 I know that the -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past, that the tech surge, the individuals who came in, came in under existing contracts with contractors.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a figure on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We actually have checked with CMS and they\xe2\x80\x99ve referred us to budgeted figures, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, if they were listening, is it okay for them to give us the updated actual figures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to refer you to CMS, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to CMS.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have that information, Margaret.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s through the White House or CMS, if we could get up-to-date estimates, that would be great.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Got it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Awesome, thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, then Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on another subject.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to us about what the President is doing in efforts to try to stave off another government shutdown?\xc2\xa0 Because we understand there are possibilities of some -- maybe a couple days after January 15th, that there could be a situation like there was a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, it is hard to imagine that Republicans would want to go down that road again, and I think a number of leading Republicans have assured the American people that they would not shut the government down again over an ideological pursuit.\xc2\xa0 So we are working with the relevant members of Congress and committees and leaders to try to find an agreement on the budget that ensures that we make the investments necessary to help our economy grow, that we make the right choices when it comes to how we fund the variety of things the government does.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a progress report on that except that we would certainly agree with those Republican leaders who have said since the debacle that they imposed on the American economy and the American middle class ended, that they won\xe2\x80\x99t do that again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President was asked by Brianna Keilar the night that he came out saying the shutdown was over -- he was asked, should we expect this to happen again?\xc2\xa0 Walking out of that door, he said no.\xc2\xa0 What is this White House doing to prevent that from happening?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if I would refer you back to that experience, that we ask for nothing in return for keeping the government open.\xc2\xa0 And we have from the beginning of the year made clear that we are willing, when it comes to budget deals, to make reasonable compromise to ensure that the economy grows faster, creates more jobs, that the middle class is more secure, and that we make the kind of investments that help our economy grow, not just now but in the future.\xc2\xa0 And the only side in this ideological debate, or in this debate that had put forward a comprehensive plan that included both -- all the elements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about over the last several years was the President\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>So we continue to negotiate in good faith, and we hope and believe that the Republicans who said that they would not shut the government down again meant it when they said it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Democrats are saying that $90 billion is just too much.\xc2\xa0 What would the White House say was a good number that they could work with that is acceptable to deal with when it comes to budget cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ninety -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure specifically what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 According to those who are wrangling this out on the Hill, Republicans want to cut $90 billion, and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that\xe2\x80\x99s just too much money to cut.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific information for you about negotiations, and if I did, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate from here.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking for information.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been very clear about his priorities.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more for you on that.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Has the President signed up for Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that he will, and has said that he will -- or the White House has said that he will, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for?\xc2\xa0 And when he does do that, will you make it open press?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Andrei.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 On Ukraine, the Prime Minister of their country has called in some ambassadors and said that the way they look at the recent events -- the events have all the hallmarks of a coup attempt, a potential coup attempt.\xc2\xa0 Basically, my question to you:\xc2\xa0 Is the White House interested in any more color revolutions in any --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t consider peaceful demonstrations coup attempts.\xc2\xa0 The violence by government authorities against peaceful demonstrators in Kiev on Saturday morning was unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 While we note that the police have generally exercised restraint since then, there have been a number of disturbing reports of journalists and members of the media being targeted and assaulted by security forces.\xc2\xa0 We urge Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to respect their people\xe2\x80\x99s right to freedom of expression and assembly.\xc2\xa0 These are fundamental to a healthy democracy and the respect for universal values on which the United States\xe2\x80\x99 partnership with Ukraine depends.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the principles embodied by the OSCE, we call on the government of Ukraine to foster a positive environment for civil society and to protect the rights of all Ukrainians to express their views on their country\xe2\x80\x99s future in a constructive and peaceful manner in Kiev and in other parts of the country.\xc2\xa0 Violence and intimidation should have no place in today\xe2\x80\x99s Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We continue to support the aspirations of the Ukrainian people to achieve a prosperous European democracy.\xc2\xa0 European integration is the surest course to economic growth and to strengthening Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s democracy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What tools do you expect to use to promote that message?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just used one of them right now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:55 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
