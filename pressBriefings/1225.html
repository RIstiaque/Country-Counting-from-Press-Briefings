b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>\n\tSee below for answers to questions (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t* The President raised Liu Xiaobo in Tuesday evening\xe2\x80\x99s small dinner and the expanded delegation meeting on Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t** While the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with the family, White House staff is in regularly touch with Rep. Giffords\xe2\x80\x99 husband, Mark Kelly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t*** Food security is a critical part of our administration\xe2\x80\x99s international efforts and of the G20 agenda and as such is often a subject of discussion with the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1:45 P.M. EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you over yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Over yesterday how?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Translation errors.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there were any translation errors.\xc2\xa0 What do you mean?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think there were -- well, if you guys have questions I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to answer them.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- what are you -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a translation error?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Simultaneous --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- no, no, we had always planned on doing, as we said yesterday, consecutive translation for the answers.\xc2\xa0 It does slow things down; it makes it a little bit more cumbersome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody told the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, he looked like he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he -- well, he did give a fairly long first answer to the consecutive translations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it a translation problem or he avoided the human rights question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A better question for the Chinese, Goyal.\xc2\xa0 I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the answer that he gave, be it to Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question or to Hans asking Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question -- (laughter) -- no, no, I mean, in all seriousness, I think you would all have to strain your recent memory to find a leader from China traveling outside of his country -- or in -- after meeting with the President on a number of occasions on this trip making such a frank admission of the improvement that needed to happen in the area of human rights in the country of China. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe process of translation was not the news yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The news was just that, that President Hu realizes that -- and told the world -- that China has to do better.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe will certainly -- while we appreciate those words, the United States will watch the actions of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But somehow --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- will watch the actions of the Chinese government to make sure that they meet the words that were spoken in the White House yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I had a couple questions, and then maybe Hans can follow up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting to use that for a good part of the -- (laughter) -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I ignore it, Hans will just come right in behind me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the staff changes related to the reelection campaign, a couple points on that.\xc2\xa0 Can we say now or can you say from the podium that the President is officially running for reelection?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that would -- I think it is likely that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, obviously.\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think as the article says, the President is likely to file papers in the future that would officially make him a candidate.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say, Ben, that the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve started and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress on getting our economy back in order, and I think the President wants to continue to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be at the time of filing some sort of event, do you anticipate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the campaign is that far down the road in the planning of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Patrick Gaspard going to the DNC -- so who will be the main political voice here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as the article -- again, as the article says, the political office closes here.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of duplication and efficiency that makes a lot of sense, to house that operation over at the Democratic National Committee.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I also wanted to ask, as the State of the Union comes up pretty quickly here, if you could give us some sense of where that speech is, but maybe more importantly, assuming you have some sense of the broad themes of where he\xe2\x80\x99s heading, can you tell us about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think broadly what I would say about the State of the Union is obviously this is a speech that will center around and the great majority of the speech will be on the steps that the President believes our country has to take to continue that economic recovery; steps that we need to take in the short term that relate to jobs and steps that we need to take in the medium and the long term to put our fiscal house in order and to increase our competitiveness and our innovation that allows us to create the jobs of tomorrow. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about certainly the notions of competitiveness and innovation a lot.\xc2\xa0 Recently he, on a number of occasions, has spoken about it in speeches.\xc2\xa0 One that comes to mind is in December in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 I think many of those -- many of the themes that you heard in that and other speeches on the economy you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear again next Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thanks.\xc2\xa0 First off on foreign policy, any reaction to the news that South Korea had agreed to talk to the North Koreans on military matters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously I think that is an important step forward.\xc2\xa0 I think some of that comes as a result of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting here that for the first time there was an acknowledgment by the Chinese about the North Koreans\xe2\x80\x99 enrichment program.\xc2\xa0 I think following that, the Republic of Korea agreeing to enter talks with the North Koreans -- clearly, conditions were created yesterday that showed the Republic of Korea that China and the United States were aligned in dealing with the aggressions of the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 So I think it is clearly a positive step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the State of the Union, will the President raise the issue of the recommendations of his deficit commission?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Without getting into a lot of detail, I think, again, spending and what we have to do to get our fiscal house in order is certainly going to be a topic that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President discuss on Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he embrace them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I -- Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99m not wont to get ahead of the President on his speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at the two-year mark for the presidency -- or the first term, depending on what happens in two years.\xc2\xa0 Where does President Obama think the state of his presidency is?\xc2\xa0 Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re in flux.\xc2\xa0 There have been changes.\xc2\xa0 You have a new chief of staff.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be leaving, Axelrod is leaving, Plouffe is in -- you have a Republican Congress.\xc2\xa0 Tell us about his thinking about what he -- how he sees this -- not the state of the union, but the state of his leadership going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he spends a lot of time separating the state of the country and where he is in his presidency, because his task is -- the task that he has before him and the task that he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring to the next two years is helping our economy continue to recover after the massive job loss and downturn of what happened as a result of the financial calamities that peaked in September of 2008.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President -- obviously there are aides inside of here and outside of here that spend time worrying about the President\xe2\x80\x99s political standing.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President spends a whole lot of time thinking through and worrying about sort of where he is in his presidency.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot on his plate and a lot that has to be done to continue that recovery, to put the pieces in place to see us be able to compete with the rest of the world, to attract the type of jobs that we know are necessary to continue our important economic growth.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on each and every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The polling numbers have improved slightly, but the standing of the President among that key group of independent voters is still not were you want it to be.\xc2\xa0 What is President Obama presumably -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean this to sound purely like a political question, but obviously for him to get support for his policies, for him to get reelected, to continue to pursue what he thinks is the best path for this country, he needs to get reelected and he needs to win those independents back.\xc2\xa0 What is he going to do to win those independents back?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I will say this, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at any series of public polling that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all churned through in the last week or so, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think the message that we saw come through and what you heard us say a lot during the lame duck I think is -- manifested itself in some of these recent numbers.\xc2\xa0 And that is that the American people would like to see Democrats and Republicans sit down at a table, be it here, be it there, and work through important solutions to the problems that face the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what we did in large measure during the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 I think with strong bipartisan votes we were able to see an agreement that didn\xe2\x80\x99t raise taxes on middle-class families, that protected our country from deployed nuclear weapons -- a whole host of things that were tremendously important, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President wants to continue to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, I think what -- it\xe2\x80\x99s that old adage that I think the President is not going to be worried about his political standing.\xc2\xa0 That will certainly -- a lot of that stuff takes care of itself.\xc2\xa0 You make good decisions on behalf of the American people, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s done for the last two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just follow up on your comments about President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s remarks on human rights.\xc2\xa0 Those are words, and while it\xe2\x80\x99s a shift, they\xe2\x80\x99re still just words.\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication from President Hu that he will be taking any actions regarding the Falun Gong, regarding Tibet, regarding the jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, look, that\xe2\x80\x99s why you heard me say at the beginning of this that while that admission is an important one, the President will continue to, in meetings with President Hu and our administration, will continue, in meetings with Chinese officials, press the case for tangible action and result on human rights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President I think was pretty forward-leaning when it came to Liu Xiaobo and the awarding of the Nobel Prize and what happened when China would not release him in order to go get that Nobel Prize.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First time I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that name in three days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President talked directly to President Hu about that.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he say?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what he said to him exactly and what --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t quote anything.\xc2\xa0 I know obviously that the topic was brought up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that at the dinner, Robert?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that was -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check. I believe it was in some of the private meetings yesterday.*<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say that those comments made by President Hu about human rights were the biggest breakthrough from the meetings?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think if you want to put -- I would put -- I think we had issues that we discussed in walking you guys through the important aspects of what we hope to get out of this visit -- security, economics and human rights -- I think we saw progress in each of those three areas, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo in the security realm, again, the Chinese acknowledgment in the statements that -- of the North Korean uranium enrichment program, setting forth a series of conditions that made the Republic of Korea confident enough to go into talks with the North Koreans -- is certain -- I would say one in the security basket.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn the economic basket, you had a series of important commercial agreements to the tune of about $45 billion, which directly support several hundred thousand American jobs right here; progress on intellectual property rights.\xc2\xa0 Obviously more has to be done on the economic basket, but, again, the progress on indigenous innovation and intellectual property rights I think were important steps to move us forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd lastly, the admission on human rights was obviously another set of issues that you heard the President discuss yesterday -- he had spent a lot of time with the Chinese President discussing over the course of the last couple days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I think we see some tangible progress on all three of those fronts that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s clearly more work that has to be done.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a currency because of some actions that the Chinese have taken, as well as inflation rise the -- increase the value of the RMB, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still progress that has to be made on that in order to, as you heard the President say yesterday, rebalance that currency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on those comments, was that a complete surprise to the administration, that he was that candid in public?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that was -- as I said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a Chinese historian, but I think if you go back in recent memory, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see where a leader of China has said that recently on a trip outside of his country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on another issue, what kind of reaction has the President given to comments about him being a one-term President?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that from Cheney and others.\xc2\xa0 How does he react to those comments?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he spends a lot of time thinking about political prognostications.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Following up on April\xe2\x80\x99s question -- I think it was a serious question -- that you had the President standing there looking embarrassed and awkward for a moment because nobody had told him that the translation was not going to be simultaneous.\xc2\xa0 Now, something as important as a press conference with the Chinese and American leaders, to have the President standing there looking like a deer in the headlights for a moment there, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a pretty big faux pas by staff to leave the President hanging out there like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He looked angry, too.\xc2\xa0 He looked angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He looked angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I could -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily agree with many of the phrases that you used in your question.\xc2\xa0 Again, we can get lost in the -- we can get lost at picking out a series of trees.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the forest that I would -- I think most people around the world had focused on was the answer.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of why I thought you guys would ask those questions of the leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the President not to be caught flat-footed out there like that by staff?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t upset?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t upset.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the points that he made and I think the progress that we made -- look, we can spend time worrying about process or we can spend time worrying about results.\xc2\xa0 I think the President spends most of his time worried about results.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was last week you were -- I just want to see if you still feel the same way -- that you were a bit noncommittal on the question of whether the President would deliver a big speech on health care reform at some point to explain that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a new CBS News or New York Times poll showing that only 10 percent of people believe the bill has been explained very well to them; 56 percent believe it\xe2\x80\x99s not been explained well to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDo you think he has -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for him to get out there and explain this thing again if people are that confused?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President has any plans to give a big speech on health care.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No plans to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, Chip, I think -- do I think that a lot of the coverage last year was on process and politics?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- do I think, at the same time, 3.3 million seniors have gotten checks to cover the doughnut hole expenses in their prescription drugs?\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why, in a series of the public polling that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, people don\xe2\x80\x99t support repeal, because they understand -- they do understand that they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s their children -- children that might have preexisting conditions not have to fight with insurance companies to ensure that they can get proper coverage.\xc2\xa0 I think they understand that insurance companies are not in charge of making all the decisions anymore, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for our medical system.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he defend it in the State of the Union address?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what degree that that is in the State of the Union.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the State of the Union -- was it Peter\xe2\x80\x99s piece, that he wants ideas that get him excited?\xc2\xa0 Has the President -- Peter Baker\xe2\x80\x99s piece said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not fully read --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President was quoted as having said that he wants ideas that get him excited, ideas for creating jobs that get him excited.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xe2\x80\x99s found any?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tune in around nine-ish on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come on, we like a little preview.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give us details.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xe2\x80\x99s found any new ideas --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can\xe2\x80\x99t do the translation -- (laughter) -- I\xe2\x80\x99m looking, I\xe2\x80\x99m -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe -- Bill, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand that -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWendell, do you have a question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the reaction to the House vote on health care repeal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten this question several times before.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not since the House actually voted, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my answer changes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a serious legislative effort and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people in the House thought it was a serious legislative effort.\xc2\xa0 I think the message, though, that those people that voted for repeal were sending were to put health insurance companies back in charge of medical decisions that have the ability to drop, deny, limit or cap health insurance coverage. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think it -- I think you got a pretty good example of who you think should be in charge of health care.\xc2\xa0 Should it be patients and doctors or should it be insurance companies?\xc2\xa0 I think that was -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, we -- I mentioned 3.3. million seniors that have gotten help with their prescription drug costs as a result of this; out-of-pocket costs that are going to go up if something like this were to become law.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think, thankfully, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President share most Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 concerns that the debate over spending cuts in the Congress now among Republicans goes too far, especially in the House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think, Wendell, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot of time to work through how we get our fiscal house back in order and the steps that we take to do so.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves crippling our ability to innovate and provide the types of incentives that we need to create the jobs of tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a yes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- it was whatever answer I just gave.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know we were playing multiple choice today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just true/false.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General has announced the military commissions board of the Cole bombing suspects will go forward.\xc2\xa0 It was 14 months ago that he said that they would go to military commission.\xc2\xa0 Why so long in setting a trial?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I read the story in the paper today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the individuals that are mentioned in the story were talked about in terms of going through military commissions, as you said, quite some time ago.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sense of timing or any sense of when final decisions on that type of thing will be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou heard the President outline --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No final decision has been made?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the -- I think if you look at -- in terms of timing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President back at the Archives speech talk about the fact that we were going to -- we had different groups of those at Guantanamo that -- they were going to have to be dealt with in different ways, which is why we sought and the President and the administration worked through a restructuring of the military commissions law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have lauded President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s admission that there\xe2\x80\x99s work to be done on Chinese human rights.\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to the fact that 1.3 billion Chinese did not hear those comments -- they were blacked out -- nor did they hear anything about Liu Xiaobo?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I -- which is why one of the conditions to coming here was an opportunity to take questions from you guys. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s very little that we can structurally do to deal with that, in terms of how they cover this visit.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very different governmental system than we do, and a very different system on how leaders in their country are covered. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut when the President was in Shanghai more than a year ago, he talked about needing an open society, having an open Internet so that people in China can read about the news all over the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe world heard the leader of China make that important admission, and the world will watch to see the steps that they take over the course of the next many months to fulfill -- or I should say to make the improvements that he says need to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the political changes and the rearranging and the establishment of the Chicago headquarters, is this not early?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you speak of the fact that the economy is getting back on its feet, there are so many things in flux, both politically and economically in this country -- is it a little early to get started on 2012?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think this is very much in line with the calendar that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen align with similar efforts that were made in -- ahead of the 2004 election and ahead of the 1996 election by Presidents Bush and Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it works. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a function of the need to begin fundraising for a formal declaration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- there are a whole series of things that have to happen in a campaign.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re happening very much in accordance with the type of timelines you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I follow on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come around.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say that he is likely or definitely running?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think obviously the setting up of a campaign makes it far likely.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think the official rendering of that decision would come, as the story notes, in the filing of that paperwork with the FEC. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up -- because I know Obama is going -- the President, excuse me, is going to Schenectady tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 What do you hope to get or what does he hope to get --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, tomorrow as you mentioned, the President will go and visit the birthplace of General Electric, talk about the economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the -- it\xe2\x80\x99s home to GE\xe2\x80\x99s largest energy division.\xc2\xa0 It will be the future home of their advanced battery manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 This is a company that has brought jobs from overseas back into the United States -- obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s important -- and a company that as a result of some of the work that the President did on commercial diplomacy before and, while in India, saw an expansion of the business that they do all over the world that supports jobs here in America.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of the backdrop of the events tomorrow in Schenectady.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any major announcements --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are likely to be some.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about those tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you all feel about this term \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a ton of time, Peter, thinking about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you find it pejorative? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time thinking about what somebody may or may not call it.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a senior who is getting help from prescription drugs calls it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a senior that gets a free preventative visit calls it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a child that no longer has to fight with an insurance company to get coverage because their preexisting condition calls it.\xc2\xa0 My sense is that all those people call it a number of different things, but in their mind it means that they\xe2\x80\x99re finally getting a little bit of help with the problems that they have.\xc2\xa0 And we live in a country where if you go sick, you ought not go bankrupt trying to get the type of care and help that you need.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what animated the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pass the bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Totally unrelated, Robert -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has had any contact with Congresswoman Giffords\xe2\x80\x99 family or any of the other victims since he was in Tucson, any other communication with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check and see if there have been -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen any calls that I know of since Tucson.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all heartened by the almost daily progress reports that we hear from Congresswoman Giffords\xe2\x80\x99 family.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing short of extraordinary the amount of progress that has been made in such a very short period of time.** \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd Peter, having been backstage before that and talking to some of those who were there that day who had come from the hospital who still had wounds, bullet wounds, from that horrific day, their stories continue to give us strength and encourage us and inspire us each day.\xc2\xa0 I told that to several of them that day and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it will be true for a really long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his message to the mayor -- the mayors this afternoon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously the mayors are in town.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about a whole host of things that mayors generally talk to the federal government and the President about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past when mayors were here, they talked a lot about the importance of the stimulus, what it did to plug gaps in their budgets.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any warning that they need to do fiscal consolidation just like the federal government might need to do fiscal consolidation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Hans, I doubt that anybody here needs to warn them of \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Many of them are dealing with and have dealt with for quite some time the impact on their budget of a dramatic downturn in our economy.\xc2\xa0 Many of them are dealing with them -- dealing with those problems far before coming here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you mentioned on Tuesday that the President is going to go over some of the material he talked about in North Carolina in December.\xc2\xa0 But will there be big new proposals on Tuesday as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine if we went all through this today what we could possibly talk about on Wednesday or Thursday, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to dip my toe deeply into the State of the Union preview pool. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And you made a distinction between the short-term focus on jobs and then the medium-term focus on getting the fiscal house in order. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I said both the medium and long term, dealing with our fiscal budget situation, but also let\xe2\x80\x99s understand the steps that we have to continue to take in the medium and the long term to prepare our children for competing in an economy against the Chinese and the Indians and a whole host of different countries.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still see something of a tension between that short-term focus on jobs and a need to keep government spending --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say we took some -- we obviously had to take, in the course of two years, some extraordinary steps to ensure that an economic downturn did not become the next Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And we did that, and some of that stuff obviously -- Hans just mentioned -- is -- a lot of that stuff has run its course through the Recovery Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, look, I think that the President wants to and will outline what he thinks is the best course forward to ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a whole host of problems, including how do we grow our economy, how do we help and work with the private sector to create jobs, and how we get our fiscal house in order all at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The same time -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of sort of one thing now, and then down the road --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think even in a -- even -- if you look at last year\xe2\x80\x99s budget, even at a time where the second half of the Recovery Act is still doing what it needed to do, the President presented a budget that froze non-security discretionary spending because we had to begin to take steps even then.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 2007, at a labor union forum, the President raised concerns about -- or the candidate at the time raised concerns about Walmart and he said I would not shop at those -- he would not shop there back there.\xc2\xa0 I wondered in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement from the First Lady if that is still true, if he would -- I know he spends a lot of time shopping, but if he were to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was going to say --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if he were to buy goods, would he feel comfortable buying goods at Walmart?\xc2\xa0 And more broadly, his views about Walmart have changed in terms of how it treats is workers and unionization --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in a -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all in a different time with clearly steps that have been taken.\xc2\xa0 I think the First Lady was proud to stand with the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest retailer.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken some dramatic steps in how they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with food and how they\xe2\x80\x99re marketing food and packaging and things like that that will make a genuine and big difference for people that shop there.\xc2\xa0 And the First Lady is proud to and happy to stand with any company that will make similar pledges to make a difference on behalf of the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of their practices, does he condemn them still in terms of how they treat workers, how they pay workers?\xc2\xa0 He was very explicit about this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- so has that changed at all -- I mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess the short answer is it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- lots has happened sine 2007.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said earlier that -- with respect to President Hu -- one of the conditions for coming here was an opportunity to take questions from you guys.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the White House set a condition for President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s visit that he would have to take questions from American reporters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was very clear in the planning of this that we would have a press conference and the press conference would include questions from you guys.\xc2\xa0 We were clear to make sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s what they understood was going to take place if they came.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was there any resistance to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I obviously did not -- I did not deal directly with them on that, but in the pre-planning for this, this was something that we talked about, and not doing it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an option.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you can remind me since I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to China, was there a press conference on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There was.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that trip?\xc2\xa0 Okay -- a joint press conference with President Hu?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was statements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, they did not take questions, right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so was this in some way a reaction to that or saying you\xe2\x80\x99re on our turf now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t in China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t take questions in China.\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, were you saying, okay, now you\xe2\x80\x99re on our turf, you need to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we were -- this is the United States of America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, global warming -- any reaction to the fact that the U.N. weather -- meteorological agency has determined that last year was tied for the warmest year on record and -- talking about the State of the Union again -- will the fact -- will the President\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that he\xe2\x80\x99s got other ways to skin the cat other than cap and trade feature in that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to the second one.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think there are continual reminders that we have to transition to a clean energy economy.\xc2\xa0 Without getting into whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s in the speech, obviously there are a number of different policy ways to do such a thing -- whether it is setting renewable energy standards that create the type of market conditions where you see that transition -- again, there are obviously a number of different ways to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President consider it a big issue still?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think energy independence and the security of our planet are and will continue to be issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to deal with.\xc2\xa0 And, again, more and more and more of our oil comes from -- or our energy comes from places that are not here.\xc2\xa0 That puts us at a disadvantage.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve clearly taken some steps to change corporate average fuel economy, fuel economy standards, that lessen some of that usage of foreign oil, but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we have a lot more to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Recovery Act invested in wind and solar.\xc2\xa0 The plant that we\xe2\x80\x99ll visit tomorrow will soon be home to GE\xe2\x80\x99s advanced battery manufacturing as you see car companies, both foreign and domestic, having success marketing cars that don\xe2\x80\x99t run on gas but run on electricity.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to meet many of those challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First is, both President Obama and President Hu mentioned about the historic meeting 30 years ago by Deng Xiaoping and how the White House evaluate this state visit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look I think -- as I said earlier, I think we saw some progress on a host of important fronts that we wanted to see progress on -- security, the economy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, again, I think that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our trip to India and South Korea, Japan, our trip to China last year, China\xe2\x80\x99s trip here -- I think they\xe2\x80\x99re better evaluated over the course of the long term to see have we set ourselves on the path to making real and substantial progress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so I think we will -- while we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the outcome of the visit from yesterday, obviously on each of those baskets that I discussed -- security, the economy and human rights -- there are still -- the two leaders talked about progress that certainly we acknowledge needs to be made and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to try to be a leader in seeing that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, on the currency issue -- you mentioned still a lot of work to be done.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the next step?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the next step is with the Chinese in taking -- continuing to take actions at a faster pace to deal with the valuation of their currency.\xc2\xa0 Again, obviously -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s been a decent amount of coverage on this -- there\xe2\x80\x99s actions that you take to change the valuation, and certainly inflation gives you some real impacts too, that that indicate there\xe2\x80\x99s been some changes, but, again, as the President said I think on a couple of occasions yesterday, not quickly enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign promises back in 2008 was passage of the employment nondiscrimination act, which would provide workplace protections to gay and transgender Americans.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the President expects to see passed over the course of the 112th Congress, at least in the Senate where Democrats still have control?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of things that the President has made part of his campaign.\xc2\xa0 We talked about DOMA a few days ago and other things that are important to build off the progress of repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think those continue to be priorities of the President\xe2\x80\x99s and we will certainly work to make progress on those fronts in obviously a much more challenging Congress over the course of the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in the Senate where Democrats still have control, is he expecting passage of the employment nondiscrimination act?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President continue to push on a whole host of those issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two more questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration see value in passing ENDA in one chamber of Congress to build momentum for complete passage at a later time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, I mean, look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that -- look, whenever you get something done in one, you\xe2\x80\x99re closer to certainly seeing it come to fruition.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the President address ENDA in any context during the State of the Union address, perhaps as a jobs bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into previewing State of the Union today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have a quick question about -- the President is going to be talking with congressional Democrats this weekend at their convention.\xc2\xa0 Does he have a message for them?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be sort of talking a little bit about what his State of the Union might talk about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll -- he travels up there tomorrow after our return from Schenectady.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk about -- talk to them about the challenges that lay ahead and what we have to do -- many of the themes that he\xe2\x80\x99ll outline in the State of the Union.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I imagine that Democrats are going to have to respond to Republicans who are not only trying to repeal the law but also they\xe2\x80\x99re making -- taking steps today to replace the health care law.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, I did notice they passed an almost one-and-a-half-page bill --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, many of which I find -- it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting -- many of the goals that they espouse in that bill are the current law of the land, like ensuring that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t discriminated because of preexisting conditions.\xc2\xa0 That actually exists -- it\xe2\x80\x99s called the Affordable Care Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not at all concerned about this effort to actually propose an alternative and the consequence for the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am happy that several years later they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten around to what they might do.\xc2\xa0 I think all of you must be anxious to know what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.\xc2\xa0 I think they have set forth some exceedingly lofty goals, again, some of which -- most of which are currently embodied in the law of the land. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for them to take a spin and tell us how they\xe2\x80\x99ll do what they passed today.\xc2\xa0 I would suggest, too, that as they talk about making some progress in the deficit, they deal with the Congressional Budget Office\xe2\x80\x99s indication that the action that they took just yesterday adds a couple of hundred billion dollars to the deficit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, keep in mind this was a CBO that, while we were going through the process of health care reform, was the be all and end all of the scorekeeper.\xc2\xa0 Then when that same CBO, headed by the very same person, discussed the very same topic of the impact of the deficit on health care reform, all of a sudden, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be right, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I do think it is important to underscore that the first legislative action that that Congress took was to repeal a law that helps seniors and helps families, and added a couple hundred billion dollars to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Not entirely sure that in the run-up to the 2010 campaign, they spent a lot of time talking to seniors about raising their out-of-pocket costs on medical care and prescription drugs or talking about adding a couple of hundred billion dollars to the deficit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on issues of gun control, former Vice President Dick Cheney said that he could see some sort of more restrictions on semi-automatic weapons, semi-automatic handguns.\xc2\xa0 Is this administration going to navigate through the steely, tough waters of gun control in the wake of what happened in Arizona?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to add to what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said I think on a couple of occasions in here on that, and that is I have no doubt that there will be proposals offered as a result of different circumstances that would have happened in Tucson.\xc2\xa0 And the administration will evaluate those proposals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with what the former Vice President had to say on semi-automatic --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking through some of those proposals. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, back on China, but on a whole other issue, on issues of unions, did --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The issue of what?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unions, unions -- they have unions in China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 No, no, I just -- sometimes I can\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lost in translation.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- believe it or not, sometimes I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have unions in China.\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss that issue there?\xc2\xa0 And particularly, the first union in China was Walmart.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me ask some of our guys whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a topic that came up.\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a completely different subject, what are the President\xe2\x80\x99s viewing plans for the NFC championship game?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do like he did last week.\xc2\xa0 Well, last week, obviously, he went to play basketball with the girls and came back a little after kickoff.\xc2\xa0 They had some staff, and the President watched most of the game over in the theater.\xc2\xa0 I think the President plans to do that again.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve given this to a few papers in Chicago and Wisconsin, the President\xe2\x80\x99s prediction that the Bears will win the game 20-17. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made any bets?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of, no. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he still go to Wisconsin, should the unthinkable happen?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re still planning a trip to Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 I might have already -- I might have just complicated the -- complicated the questions you asked sort of with Ben on the political effort by predicting the team in Wisconsin not doing as well against the team in Illinois.\xc2\xa0 So, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- not a hypothetical. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGo ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If they lose, he won\xe2\x80\x99t go?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Of course he is going to Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 Of course he is going to Wisconsin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about February 5th in Dallas? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think our President hopes to have his team playing there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If they win he plans to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, I\xe2\x80\x99m a very --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, this is superstition.\xc2\xa0 I will answer this question on behalf of him based on superstition.\xc2\xa0 I think all of that is way, way, way getting ahead of yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he superstitious that way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not nearly as much as I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a stab at this.\xc2\xa0 In the State of the Union address, the President no doubt will remind Americans that we have troops on the ground in two war zones.\xc2\xa0 Will he, though, at the same time, try to get the American people and the Republicans behind the idea of maybe pulling back on defense spending, considering everything else he may mention in terms of reducing spending yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it is safe to say that we are going to see or going to have to see a tightening of the belt around everything that government is doing in order to make progress on getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, has made some -- has taken some steps on procurement reform and taken some steps to cancel weapon systems and programs that for quite some time the military itself hasn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted despite the fact that Congress might continue to fund it.\xc2\xa0 I think those type of efforts have to happen because we can\xe2\x80\x99t see taxpayer dollars wasted on anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the American people may not know about like a strike joint fighter or debate over an engine kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should the President maybe point that out in the State of the Union address?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into what may or may not be in there, again, I think whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the speech or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President and the Secretary will continue to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tStephen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s remarks on human rights are being over-read at all, given the fact that several occasions yesterday he stated that China didn\xe2\x80\x99t share Western definitions of human rights?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to translate the translation.\xc2\xa0 But I will say this, as I started out by saying, I think that regardless of what he said yesterday, the true test is not in the words that someone speaks but in the actions that a country takes.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what animated the President to bring up the issue of human rights again and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the actions that that country takes is how we will evaluate the progress that they may or may not make over the course of coming months and weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any sense in which you could see this as -- this scripted answer, it was obviously a scripted answer -- that he had as a way to alleviate pressure while stating that China would continue on its current --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because -- well, because, again -- look, I think you could read it -- maybe you can read it several different ways.\xc2\xa0 I think it was an admission that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard before.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think -- I know the way we read it and that is acknowledging that is -- acknowledging that you have improvements to make is part of it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a very small part compared to what has to be done to make progress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was something like that said privately though?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I was not in some of the private meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGo ahead, yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Guantanamo, Robert, with the reports that the administration is likely to start military trials in Guantanamo, what does this mean for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts of moving some detainees back to either their home countries or host countries?\xc2\xa0 And does that have any effect on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s talks with these other countries?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that look, there are -- let me at the beginning of my answer acknowledge obviously there are some prohibitions, legal prohibitions now, on some transfers that I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen our commenting on in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe will continue the process of going through who is there.\xc2\xa0 Clearly the courts continue that process of going through who is there and deciding whether or not their continued -- whether them being continually held there is in accordance with the laws, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen courts do in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut none of these decisions change our fundamental desire and goal to see, because of our security, the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed once and for all. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it cause of delay in any of these?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are there any deadlines that have been --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the fact that the individuals that were named in today\xe2\x80\x99s story were the same three individuals that were talked about to be tried in military commissions quite some time ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDavid.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on April\xe2\x80\x99s question for a second.\xc2\xa0 Representative McCarthy and Senator Lautenberg have posed bills that would ban high-magazine -- high ammo in guns.\xc2\xa0 Have there been any discussions between those offices and the White House whether that it is a proposal worth pursuing in this Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what specific conversations have been had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the President\xe2\x80\x99s previous positions on banning assault weapons in favor of some gun control measures, is this something that you think he\xe2\x80\x99d likely support?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking through different proposals -- the proposals that you mentioned and others -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate them based on those events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any possibility you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be proactive and propose something of your own?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard anything particular in here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers have been moving up fairly steadily.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s at 50 percent in the average for the first time in a year.\xc2\xa0 To what does the White House attribute that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that -- I think I said earlier that I think you -- I think what the American people said in the election was they wanted two political parties to be able to work together and make progress on issues that were important to them, particularly economic issues.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what they saw during the lame duck session.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that was a productive time.\xc2\xa0 People saw Republicans and Democrats working together to make sure their tax rates didn\xe2\x80\x99t go up.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some obvious benefit to doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just back on the reelection real quick.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, the President said right after midterms there would be plenty of time for the next election in 2012.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing -- I\xe2\x80\x99d bet my paycheck he is going to, in the State of the Union, call for rising above politics and doing the work of the country.\xc2\xa0 Why announce the reelection --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How much is your paycheck?\xc2\xa0 Because I may try to go get him to change a few lines just to -- (laughter) -- sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did better off the - but, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, why announce this now?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it complicate the State of the Union?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, because, Sam, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand just because the President sets up the machinery of ultimately running for reelection does not mean that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the President doing a ton of political reelection events.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just -- the nature of the way these things work is you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to set up a legal mechanism by which to begin to fund something like this.\xc2\xa0 You have to get people in place.\xc2\xa0 You saw the quotes in the story that this will be located in Chicago and focus on the type of grassroots effort that we saw in 2008.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the President is going to spend a whole lot of time worrying about that.\xc2\xa0 The campaign is going to be run by a group of people in Chicago whose jobs will be to worry about that, not the President\xe2\x80\x99s.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also wanted to ask, the Vice President sent out an email to supporters today in which he says that this White House has accomplished more in the first two years than any President since Roosevelt -- FDR.\xc2\xa0 Is that the administration belief?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to contradict the Vice President, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What type of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Kind of a slow group today, come on, guys.\xc2\xa0 I know we got the -- I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the post-China blues, but come on, a little help here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I was going to say -- well, that would certainly liven things up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll insert the adjective.\xc2\xa0 Robert, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to remind you that Senator Lieberman endorsed John McCain, campaign for him, and said that Barack Obama wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared to be President.\xc2\xa0 Is the President relieved to see Joe Lieberman out of the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, obviously we had a little disagreement on the 2008 presidential campaign, but I think Senator Lieberman is -- look, take the most recent -- the progress that we were taking about that was made in the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously Senator Lieberman is somebody who, while having disagreements with this White House and with Senator Obama when he was in the United States Senate, clearly played an important and instrumental role in rolling back something that he and the President shared a belief in the injustice of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I think that obviously Senator Lieberman made a decision, as he said, to go on and do something different in his life, and while we haven\xe2\x80\x99t agreed with him on every issue, I think clearly there are a whole host of issues -- energy independence, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d -- a whole lot of issues that the President was happy to see Senator Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and support on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they ever have a get-together where they just said, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s let bygones by bygones and move forward together, after the election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I think there are obviously opportunities -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President needed to have some air-clearing moment.\xc2\xa0 People are free to make decisions -- Senator Lieberman was -- about who to support for -- to run for President.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody here spent a lot of time thinking about that.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there were some who thought, maybe because of that, Senator Lieberman wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the chairman of the committee and that was not a view that we held.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President has been briefed on what appear to be impending global food shortages as a result of aberrant weather in Asia or South America and South Africa.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of whether he has been or not, but let me see if that has either come up in an NSC meeting or in any of his economic daily briefings.***<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLet me go to two back here -- yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was an arrest in Canada last night of a guy apparently plotting to kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and this is the latest of several terror-related arrests with a Canadian connection.\xc2\xa0 I just wondered is the White House growing concerned about Canada as a possible terrorist haven?\xc2\xa0 Are there any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me ask NSC.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any guidance on that.\xc2\xa0 But let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get something from NSC on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the emphasis on regulation this week, there was a bill reintroduced today that -- backed by Speaker Boehner -- that would require a vote on regulations, executive regulations, before they could go through.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that or views on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance on that bill.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with it, but let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s some guidance from Legislative Affairs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:45 P.M.
