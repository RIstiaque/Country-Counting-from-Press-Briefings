EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Can we assume the position here?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a quick thing at the top and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic agenda to expand opportunity for all Americans, this week he\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on additional ways we can create good jobs by continuing to spur innovation, entrepreneurship and manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, the President will travel to Pittsburgh, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with workers at TechShop, a company that helps American investors make affordable prototypes.</p>\n<p>Then, on Wednesday, the President will host the first-ever White House Maker Faire, where he will meet Americans who are taking the challenge of innovation into their own hands.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told there will be 3-D printed pancakes at the event.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pancakes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So there are a lot of reasons to eagerly anticipate Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s event.</p>\n<p>Nationwide, the maker movement opens access to new tools for democratized production, and is boosting innovation and entrepreneurship in manufacturing in the same way that the Internet and cloud computing have lowered the barriers to entry for digital startups and assisted in the revitalization of American manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 In advance of these events, I expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some new announcements to make about additional steps the public and private sectors will take to further expand this kind of manufacturing innovation.</p>\n<p>So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President considering President Rouhani\xe2\x80\x99s offer to help in Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is there are ongoing conversations in Vienna -- or conversations in Vienna that are about to start among the P5-plus-1 members and senior Iranian officials about their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Those conversations and resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the Iranian nuclear program remains a top priority of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some State Department officials acknowledge today that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there could be some conversations on the margins of that meeting among the P5-plus-1 members.\xc2\xa0 But I want to make very clear that any of those conversations that may occur on the margins are entirely separate from the conversations about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that.</p>\n<p>The second thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for you to understand is that any conversations with the Iranian regime will not include military coordination.\xc2\xa0 We will not be -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in any effort to coordinate military activities with Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The third thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say about this also relates to something we will not discuss, and that specifically is the future of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So Iraq is an independent, sovereign country and decisions about the future of Iraq should be made by an Iraqi political leadership that reflects the best interests of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population.\xc2\xa0 Decisions about Iraqis\xe2\x80\x99 futures should be made solely in that venue and not by outside actors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what might be coordinated with Iran, given what will not be coordinated with Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s been made clear -- and I think even according to published reports, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Iranians feel a stake in resolving the deteriorating security situation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of all of the countries in the region that the kind of violence at the hands of extremists that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Iraq come to an end.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also in the interest of countries throughout the region to see the Iraq leadership pursue the governing of that country in a non-sectarian way; that there\xe2\x80\x99s a way for countries in the region to support the efforts of the Iraqi political leadership to invest in a political agenda and in security forces that are not sort of riven by sectarian differences.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama want the U.S. and Iran to both apply pressure on Maliki to behave a certain way?\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama want the U.S. and Iran to work together to find regional efforts with other countries?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me affirmatively what he is comfortable with partnering with Iran to do?\xc2\xa0 And would he speak with Rouhani himself, or is it not going to happen at that level?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any predictions about what kinds of conversations may occur other than to say that conversations may occur on the margins of the P5-plus-1 meeting in the context of conversations that are entirely separate from ongoing nuclear talks.</p>\n<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I think the administration would like to see:\xc2\xa0 We would like to see the Iranian regime and the leaders of other countries in the region play a constructive role in encouraging Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to pursue an inclusive diplomatic agenda.\xc2\xa0 That means that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the United States that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of all of these countries, including Iran, to see an Iraq that\xe2\x80\x99s governed in a non-sectarian way, and that investments in building up an inclusive political agenda and strengthening security forces, which are obviously in need of strengthening, that all of that is done in the context of a non-sectarian, inclusive effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you keep mentioning that both talks would be separate from the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States concerned that Iran might use this as leverage in the P5-plus-1?\xc2\xa0 Clearly, they have something right now that the United States wants.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned about that because, as I mentioned, the conversations that are ongoing with the P5-plus-1 members and Iran about their nuclear security program -- about their nuclear program is something that continues to be a high priority of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pursue the opportunity for a resolution to those differences that exist between the Iranian regime and the international community.\xc2\xa0 There is a deadline, a July 20th deadline that\xe2\x80\x99s been set for resolving those differences of opinion.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s our view that significant gaps remain between the international community\xe2\x80\x99s position for resolving these differences and what the Iranians have stated a willingness to do.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend some time over the course of the next month in advance of the July 20th deadline trying to bridge the significant gaps that still remain.</p>\n<p>But all of that is very important work and entirely separate from the common interest that is shared by countries in the region who would like to see the peaceful resolution of the security situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see any ironies in the fact that Washington is asking for Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s assistance on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think those are your words.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite say that.\xc2\xa0 I think it is merely an observation by many people in the international community that there is a shared interest among the variety of countries in the region around Iraq to see this kind of extremism, violent extremism stopped in its tracks.\xc2\xa0 And it is not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest for the nation of Iraq to be torn apart along sectarian lines in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s driven by extremists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s track record on Iraq that suggests that it\xe2\x80\x99s really interested in a multi-sectarian government.\xc2\xa0 In previous episodes where the sectarian stuff has blown up, the Iranians have typically sent in their own agents, sent in Quds force, played a disruptive role.\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is whether, if this conversation were to happen this week, you\xe2\x80\x99d be laying down some pretty strong markers to the Iranians saying, look, we know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done before in cases like this; don\xe2\x80\x99t plan on doing it this time.\xc2\xa0 Would that be a fair characterization?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of characterizing those conversations before they occur.\xc2\xa0 But you can --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s record on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you can assume that the message that we are sending publicly about the need for all of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to pursue an inclusive political agenda is a position that will be conveyed candidly to the Iranian leadership if those kinds of conversations actually occur.\xc2\xa0 But there is no -- I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is this:\xc2\xa0 Our position on this is really, really clear.\xc2\xa0 We do think that there is some common ground, because we do think it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of Iran and other countries that neighbor Iraq for this kind of violent sectarian strife to come to an end because it\xe2\x80\x99s in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The kind of violence and sectarian strife that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Syria has spilled over into Iraq, and it has had a destabilizing impact on that regime and on that country.\xc2\xa0 So, presumably, the leaders of other countries wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that destabilizing activity continue to occur and propagate.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question on this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable concern on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s part that if the United States is contemplating military action that\xe2\x80\x99s potentially destabilizing on its own border, would there be any thought to also offering the Iranians assurances that were the U.S. to consider military action it would be strictly limited, it would only be aimed at sort of fending off this insurgency as opposed to something bigger, which obviously Iran has had occasion to see in the past from the United States.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, even outside the context of Iran, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what kind of -- what the goals of any contemplated military action would be.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, they would be to bolster efforts by the Iraqi leadership to pursue a more inclusive political agenda.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true whether Iran is involved or not.</p>\n<p>And I guess the other thing that I want to do here is reiterate something that the President said on Friday, which is that any of the military options that the President might consider, they would not include an open-ended military commitment.\xc2\xa0 They would not include combat boots on the grounds.\xc2\xa0 And they would be predicated on commitments from the Iraqi political leadership to pursue an inclusive political agenda that takes into account the legitimate grievances of the Kurdish, Shia and Sunni populations in that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the executive order?\xc2\xa0 A couple things.\xc2\xa0 Has he signed it yet?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any fact sheet, or are you releasing anything about how many people are affected, any economic impact?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, Steve, the only thing I can confirm is that the President, following on his pledge for this to be a year of action to expand opportunity for all Americans, has directed his staff to prepare for his signature, an executive order that prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\xc2\xa0 The specific details of that order have not been finalized, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you the kinds of details that you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Electronically or by --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He has not signed it yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he lands today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The details are still being formalized.\xc2\xa0 What the President has asked is for his staff to put together an executive order like this.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s ready to be signed yet.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s asked them to put together an executive order that can be signed in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No numbers on how many people would be affected?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we may have more information on once we have the details of what this executive order says.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, the community has been asking for this since 2008.\xc2\xa0 Why did it take so long?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, Steve, what we have sought is congressional legislation on this.\xc2\xa0 The action that the -- an executive order along these lines would not be a substitute for robust congressional action.\xc2\xa0 Last year we did see the Senate pass the so-called ENDA legislation.\xc2\xa0 We have for several months now been encouraging the House to take up and pass that legislation.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, this is yet another example of Republicans blocking progress on the kind of issue that has pretty strong support all across the country.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed that the House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken action.\xc2\xa0 The President was really clear at the beginning of the year that once we want to work with Congress in bipartisan fashion to make progress on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 But the President is not going to give up his ability to act unilaterally in pursuit of that kind of agenda.\xc2\xa0 And I think an executive order like this is a pretty good example of that strategy on the President\xe2\x80\x99s part, which is to work with Congress where we can but also act unilaterally where necessary to advance expanded opportunity for the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one more on Iraq?\xc2\xa0 On Friday, the president said he would have a better sense by the end of the weekend what international partners might be willing to do to aid in any U.S. action in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could describe the outreach that happened over the weekend and the reception that you might be getting from other foreign leaders.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have some information about it. Secretary Kerry placed a number of calls over the weekend to some of his counterparts in the region.\xc2\xa0 He called the foreign ministers of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You recall that on Friday the President directed his national security team to spend some time working over the weekend assembling a range of options for him.\xc2\xa0 You received emails from me over the weekend a couple of times a day letting you know that the President was in pretty close touch with his National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, who regularly updated him on a few things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The first -- she obviously updated him on the security situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 She also updated him on the diplomatic discussions that have been ongoing at a variety of levels, both with the Iraqi political leadership, the political leadership of other countries in the region, and countries around the world that have a legitimate concern similar to the concern we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed about the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>She also kept him updated on the conversations that were ongoing among members of his national security team.\xc2\xa0 She provided the President another update along these lines this morning before we left Palm Springs.\xc2\xa0 The President said that he wanted to meet with his national security team when he returns to Washington this evening.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of that meeting would be to hear from members of his national security team directly about their ongoing efforts to present him with a range of options.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that\xe2\x80\x99s still ongoing, and this will be an opportunity for him to talk directly with members of his national security team about those ongoing efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any updates about what that thinking is?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any sense of what a timetable might be for an announcement of U.S. action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on those conversations other than to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re ongoing.\xc2\xa0 This obviously is serious work, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team takes very seriously.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a collaborative effort among the diplomatic members of his team.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also an important role here for the military and the intelligence teams to present the President with a range of options, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that they\xe2\x80\x99re still working on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- happens tonight, it will be military, plus the NSC formally presenting the -- is it right to say that he will be presented with the range of options tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think what I can say confidently now is the President will be updated on their ongoing efforts.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position right now to say whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99ll be presented with a range of options in the context of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 But the goal of this meeting is for the President to get an update on the thinking of individual members of his team as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working over the weekend to prepare --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dempsey, as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will see if we can get you a manifest of those who participate in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it with me right now, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect a readout as well, afterwards?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you something.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do we think of you moving people out of the embassy in Baghdad?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect Baghdad to be under great threat or do you expect some recriminations if you take military action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the actions right now are precipitated on doing everything we can to protect the security of Americans who are representing our interests in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So there have been some movements that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about of relocating some staff members to some consulates in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the embassy is open and is conducting official business.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we, the President always is concerned about is doing everything that we can to preserve the safety and security of Americans who are serving abroad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back to the ENDA question.\xc2\xa0 White House officials have been saying for ages that the President did not want to do this executive order because you wanted to leave open room for the legislative solution to happen.\xc2\xa0 What led to you deciding to do it this week?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any sense of a timetable as to when that order will be ready for him to sign?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do want to be crystal clear about something, which is that the door for legislative action remains open.\xc2\xa0 There is nothing in an executive order that they\xe2\x80\x99re still working to put together that would preclude Congress from taking an important but commonsense step to pass legislation that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, an executive order that the President would sign along these lines would apply to federal contractors.\xc2\xa0 And Congress would have the power to pass legislation, and it\xe2\x80\x99s passed the Senate already, to ensure -- to ban this discrimination across the country.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s something much more widespread that Congress can do.\xc2\xa0 It has passed through the Senate; it should pass through the House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the question was, why are you doing it now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, quite simply, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for quite a few months now for the House to take action, and unfortunately there aren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly strong indications that Congress is prepared to act on this.\xc2\xa0 So like I said, we stand ready to continue to work with Congress to advance the cause of expanding opportunity for all Americans all across the country.\xc2\xa0 This is one way in which Congress could act to do that, and we stand ready to work with them to get that done.\xc2\xa0 But the President is not just going to sit around and wait for Congress to take action.\xc2\xa0 This has not been a particularly prolific Congress when it comes to passing legislation, even legislation that has strong support all across the country like this.</p>\n<p>So the President is going to do what he can -- in this case, consider an executive order that would ban discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When do you think that will be ready for him to sign?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable at this point, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated.\xc2\xa0 If I can get you better guidance about that timetable, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s still some work that needs to be done to prepare an executive order for his signature.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a quick Russia question?\xc2\xa0 Some indications that Russia has been limiting through Gazprom the supplies to Ukraine, and that is affecting Ukrainians and also prices in Europe.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that -- is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s concern that Russia is taking advantage of the situation with Iraq to kind of make a move?\xc2\xa0 Or maybe completely disconnected from that, do you have concerns about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now with Russia and oil supplies to Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us say before that access to energy supplies should not be used to inappropriately influence the government of another country.\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used to coerce another nation\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about and we\xe2\x80\x99re following very closely.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity for us to act with our partners around the world to protect the interests of a sovereign Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The EU has been actively engaged in trying to negotiate a settlement to this dispute between the Russians and the Ukrainians, and we\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of that effort and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful it will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the situation on the border?\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is heading down to Guatemala, and part of the reason officials said he was going was to dispel a misperception there that the President\xe2\x80\x99s delayed deportation -- deferred deportation policy would affect them and that they would be able to take advantage of it.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what led the White House to believe that\xe2\x80\x99s become an issue -- because just last week you were sort of writing that off as a political talking point for Republicans.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the suggestion from Republicans was a little bit less honest than the assessment that you presented.\xc2\xa0 Let me just leave it at that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The efforts of the Vice President are to go and cooperate with our partners in Central America because we have a shared interest in the safety of children, and that what we have seen is an influx of unaccompanied minors at the border between the United States and Mexico, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And there have been a number of steps that have been ramped up to try to meet the humanitarian needs of children who show up on the border and are apprehended by the<br/>\n\tBorder Patrol.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole effort that\xe2\x80\x99s been stood up by FEMA, including good work from HHS to try to meet this growing need.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what the Vice President will be engaged in is talking to the leaders of these other countries, because the leaders of these other countries are obviously concerned about the safety and security of kids in their country, and the United States remains concerned too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So went to -- if there are steps that these countries can take to ensure the safety of their children and to dissuade parents from entrusting them in the hands of strangers to try to deliver them to the United States, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to shut that off as quickly as we can.\xc2\xa0 And some of that is making sure that those parents understand exactly what the law is, and the law says that these unaccompanied minors when they show up at the border would not qualify for deferred action, like the administration announced a couple years ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify -- you do believe the misperceptions of the deferred action is part of what\xe2\x80\x99s leading to this wave of immigrant kids on the border?\xc2\xa0 The White House now is certain that that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what is leading to all of these kids coming over here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to put myself in a position of being able to understand exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, but to the extent that we can clarify what the law is, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that.\xc2\xa0 And that will be part of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s mission.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just as we were taking off I saw a report that Malia Obama is working as a production assistant on a Steven Spielberg film.\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about that, and confirm whether that\xe2\x80\x99s true?\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s not on this flight.\xc2\xa0 Is she living in California temporarily to do that?\xc2\xa0 Or what is the situation there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports as well, Nedra.\xc2\xa0 As you know, what we have done to protect the privacy of the President and First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters is to talk about the daughters\xe2\x80\x99 activities when they\xe2\x80\x99re appearing in public with their parents, and conversely to not talk about their activities when they\xe2\x80\x99re not appearing in public with their parents.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and live up to that principle in the context of this gaggle and not comment on those reports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it rises to the level of like a public official and sort of a public event?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like an internship with no one you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard of.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Steven Spielberg.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- photos of her going in and off the job site, too, right?\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the line that we draw is related to the two daughters being involved in public activities with their parents; that when they are traveling with them -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that I try to -- that we worked over the weekend to provide you some greater clarity about whether or not they were in California with the President and First Lady.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, this was a public trip of the President and First Lady to California, and so there are potential -- the involvement of the First Daughters in that trip was a legitimate question, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we were able to determine for you that Malia did spend the weekend with her parents and Sasha did not.</p>\n<p>But in terms of what Malia and Sasha are up to when their parents aren\xe2\x80\x99t around is not something I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to be in a position to get into.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would just add that I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty respectful of that as well, but if she is living in another state, that\xe2\x80\x99s significant, I would say.\xc2\xa0 And maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s not, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I just want to put it -- make that on the record.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I will stipulate to the fact that the President and First Lady are genuinely appreciative of the respect that the White House Press Corps has shown to their daughters and the privacy that\xe2\x80\x99s been afforded to them, even in a pretty competitive media environment.\xc2\xa0 So I am appreciative of that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that questions along these lines, based on public reports, are somehow illegitimate or unfair.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one thing about the IRS.\xc2\xa0 The IRS said that a computer crash led to an untold number of Lois Lerner\xe2\x80\x99s emails being -- they just disappeared apparently.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable explanation?\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of technical experts say, well, you know, e-mails aren\xe2\x80\x99t stored on a computer, they\xe2\x80\x99re stored on a cloud somewhere.\xc2\xa0 Does that seem like a reasonable thing for the IRS to be telling congressional investigators who are outraged that these e-mails have gone missing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of a computer crashing before?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think e-mails generally are not stored on a computer; they\xe2\x80\x99re stored on a server somewhere.\xc2\xa0 And the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for these e-mails going missing was that her computer crashed.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of people are skeptical of, one, that that\xe2\x80\x99s a truthful answer, and two, that they\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to mislead Congress or trying to hide something in these e-mails.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you think that\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely reasonable, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth and it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, and speculation otherwise I think is indicative of the kinds of conspiracies that are propagated around this story.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re propagated in a way that has left people with a very mistaken impression about what exactly occurred.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, 67,000 e-mails either sent by or received by Lois Lerner have been provided to Congress.\xc2\xa0 So if we are trying to hide Lois Lerner\xe2\x80\x99s e-mails from congressional oversight, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty large loophole.\xc2\xa0 Thousands of those e-mails actually relate to the time period covered by the hard drive crash that you referred to.\xc2\xa0 So we have -- or IRS, I should say, has been engaged in an effort to track down e-mails that she may have sent or may have received.\xc2\xa0 And tens of thousands of those have also been provided to Congress.</p>\n<p>So there is ample evidence to indicate that a good-faith effort has been made by the IRS to cooperate with congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 And the far-fetched skepticism expressed by some Republican members of Congress I think is not at all surprising and not particularly believable.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:31 P.M.
