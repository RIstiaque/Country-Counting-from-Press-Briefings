Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t2:04 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you decked out in your green today for St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day, at least many of you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m joining the fun, as well. \xc2\xa0I do not have anything to say at the top other than thank you for accommodating my schedule and shifting the briefing back a little bit later today. \xc2\xa0I appreciate that. \xc2\xa0My schedule has been even a little more aggressive than usual today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Anything we need to know?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Stay tuned. \xc2\xa0Stay tuned. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Stay tuned.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There you go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is someone going to walk out maybe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0At least not that I know of. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how it goes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is Ben back there? \xc2\xa0Okay, just checking. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Darlene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about what is the practical effect of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s determination that ISIL is committing genocide against Christians and the Yazidis and others?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously over the last few weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99ve received a number of questions about this. \xc2\xa0I know that my colleagues at the State Department and other national security agencies across the government have been asked about this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the -- in Iraq and in Syria is deeply troubling. \xc2\xa0We do see this extremist organization targeting religious minorities. \xc2\xa0In their propaganda they\xe2\x80\x99re featuring evidence of trying to wipe out these religious minorities. \xc2\xa0And the President has talked on a number of occasions about how this is deeply troubling and is an affront to every person of faith.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has ordered military action against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0In some cases, there have been military actions that have been ordered specifically to protect religious minorities. \xc2\xa0So there certainly is the example of Mount Sinjar, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve cited here frequently, that there were Yazidis who were trapped on that mountain. \xc2\xa0ISIL fighters had them cornered, and those ISIL fighters were vowing to slaughter them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere was also a less prominent example of this, but an important one, nonetheless, that there were ISIL fighters that were carrying out a siege in the Iraqi town of Amirli, where there were an estimated 13,000 Turkmen Shia surrounded by ISIL fighters. \xc2\xa0And again, the United States took military action to break that siege.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the United States has, on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, taken steps to try to protect religious minorities in that region of the world from being the victims of violence at the hands of ISIL. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just true of Yazidis and Shia Muslims, it\xe2\x80\x99s also true of Christians. \xc2\xa0And Secretary Kerry announced today what I thought was a powerful speech, discussing how he now has judged, assessed that ISIL is responsible for genocide in this region of the world in areas under its control, particularly as it relates to Yazidi, Christian, and Shia populations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this designation is significant. \xc2\xa0It reflects the gravity of the situation there. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s one that continues to attract the attention not just of the United States, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also why the United States has been able to build a strong moral case against ISIL, and build a substantial international coalition of 66 nations to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does it change -- does the determination change anything on the ground now, today or tomorrow, for any of the people who are being persecuted or feeling persecuted?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what it essentially indicates is that the United States will cooperate with independent efforts to investigate genocide. \xc2\xa0There obviously is evidence that\xe2\x80\x99s been collected, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that that evidence is preserved, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll assist in the effort, collecting and analyzing additional evidence of atrocities to support that investigation. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s the next step in the process, and the United States will be supportive of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Some groups want the administration to do more, militarily, to fight ISIL. \xc2\xa0Do you foresee that happening at some point as a result of this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is going to continue to rely on the good advice of his military commanders. \xc2\xa0Some of that will obviously be related to the kind of military contributions that other countries who are part of our coalition make to this effort. \xc2\xa0The amount of military involvement in this region of the world has already been significant. \xc2\xa0More than 10,000 airstrikes have been carried out against ISIL targets. \xc2\xa0About 40 percent of the property -- territory that ISIL controlled in Iraq is area that is no longer under their control. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe percentage is somewhat smaller in Syria. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s between 10 and 20 percent. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that we have had some success in combining the military might of our coalition with the effectiveness of fighters on the ground, fighting for their own country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of our strategy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are other elements of our strategy, too, in terms of shutting down the flow of foreign fighters, making it harder for ISIL to recruit fighters to their cause, and obviously making it harder for ISIL to finance their efforts. \xc2\xa0All those elements of our strategy have contributed to our success as well. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to military action against ISIL, that military action has been robust, it\xe2\x80\x99s made a difference, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been closely coordinated with fighters on the ground that, ultimately, need to be responsible for fighting for their own country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President was having a conference call today on Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about who he was talking to on the call and what the message was that he had for that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the White House, leading up to the President making a decision about his Supreme Court nominee, had engaged with a variety of organizations -- not just around town but across the country, and this was an opportunity for those organizations and their members to hear directly from the President about why he made this choice. \xc2\xa0And I think the President obviously spent some time discussing how proud he is of the choice that he\xe2\x80\x99s made; how committed he is to the constitutional responsibility that he has to make this choice; and how committed he is to making the case to Congress that they should fulfill their constitutional duty as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen in on the call, but I would be surprised if there was anything that the President said on the call that would have surprised you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you know if he asked them to do anything specific in this two-week period that\xe2\x80\x99s coming up when the Senate is on recess and members are going back to their districts, and you all are hoping that they\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot of pushback from their constituents on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President had any specific asks -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll look into that. \xc2\xa0But I think the President sent a pretty clear signal, though, that this a high priority of his, and he hoped that this would be a priority that people all across the country would share.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And finally, just one more on this. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some speculation that there is some sort of a deal that Republicans signaled to the White House that if the President nominated Garland, he would be confirmed -- they would confirm him in a lame duck session if Hillary Clinton wins the election. \xc2\xa0Is there any sort of deal or agreement along those lines?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0The truth is we do not think that there is any good reason that anybody in the Senate can articulate for waiting until the lame duck to confirm a consensus nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0There is no excuse. \xc2\xa0The only excuse we occasionally hear from Republicans is that politics is getting in the way. \xc2\xa0Well, I think my message to them is, don\xe2\x80\x99t let politics get in the way of doing your job. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the American people are particularly understanding or sympathetic to Republicans that they won\xe2\x80\x99t do their job because it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year. \xc2\xa0In fact, in election years, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually when we have a tendency to pay the most attention to whether or not our elected representatives, at the federal or state level, are doing their jobs. \xc2\xa0And right now, Republicans are promising not to do their job, even though the President has given them a golden opportunity to rise above politics. \xc2\xa0The President has put forward a nominee that Republicans themselves say would do a good job on the Court. \xc2\xa0Senator Hatch described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be particularly difficult for Republicans to put politics aside, put their constitutional duty first, and follow the long-followed steps of confirming the President\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee in a timely fashion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a strategy to soften Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s resolve on not holding any votes and not having any hearings?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'re certainly going to continue to make a forceful, principled case that that\'s what he should do. \xc2\xa0Fortunately, the White House is not in a position of speaking alone on this matter. \xc2\xa0We\'ve obviously been quite pleased with the response among Democrats in the United States Senate to the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to nominate Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0I think it is evidence that Senator Hatch was right when he described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee, because we see so many Democrats out there saying that he was a good pick. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat may be surprising to some is that there are plenty of conservatives who have had positive things to say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0I can give you a couple of examples. \xc2\xa0I just happen to have them right here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Judge Ken Starr, who as the Solicitor General, represented the United States of America before the Supreme Court, somebody who knows a little something about the law, described Chief Judge Garland as \xe2\x80\x9csuperbly qualified to serve on our nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest court.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0We discussed the op-ed that President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez, wrote, indicating that Chief Judge Garland deserves a vote, and urging the Senate to follow through on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I can understand if Leader McConnell may not be particularly sympathetic to my point of view, but maybe somebody that has the legal expertise and the intellectual weight of somebody like Judge Starr or Attorney General Gonzalez -- maybe they can prevail upon Leader McConnell to put the interests of the United States and the functioning of our justice system ahead of his more parochial political concerns.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House see any cracks within the Senate Republicans? \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reports about Senator Grassley may be willing to see Judge Garland in the next couple weeks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Judge Garland did have an opportunity to talk with Chairman Grassley yesterday on the telephone. \xc2\xa0As is also customary, White House staff had been in touch with a number of offices on Capitol Hill to begin arranging meetings for Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0As is customary, they contacted leadership offices as well as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0And in those staff-level conversations, Senator Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s staff indicated to the White House that they\xe2\x80\x99d be prepared to schedule a meeting after the two-week recess that the Senate will begin at the end of this week. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat obviously is something we believe is entirely appropriate. \xc2\xa0It certainly is I think the most basic expectation that people would have for a Senate Judiciary Chairman when a consensus Supreme Court nominee has been put forward. \xc2\xa0And so we\'re hopeful that that\'s something that will be scheduled.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the one thing -- Senator Grassley, previously today, indicated that he mused out loud about whether or not somebody was listening in on his phone call with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0I can assure you that that, of course, is not true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I would hope, despite political differences, that Chairman Grassley will fulfill his responsibility and be able to work with the White House to at least begin the process of scheduling a meeting with Chief Judge Garland.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And how does the President plan to stay involved next week during a very historic trip?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President will continue to be engaged in this process. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit more detail about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in Latin America to discuss tomorrow. \xc2\xa0But there will one or two opportunities over the course of the five-day trip for the President to take questions from all of you. \xc2\xa0So to the extent that all of you may continue to be interested in this story, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll have some questions for the President. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will be happy to answer them, even if those answers need to also be subsequently translated into Spanish.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around. \xc2\xa0Andrew.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just coming back to the point on genocide. \xc2\xa0You talked about independent investigations. \xc2\xa0Can you be a bit more specific? \xc2\xa0Are you talking about the ICC?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the ICC typically is the organization that would take a look at this. \xc2\xa0And given the judgment that Secretary Kerry has made, the United States would be supportive of that effort, both rhetorically but also in a tangible way as well. \xc2\xa0The United States will support efforts to collect, document, preserve and analyze evidence of atrocities. \xc2\xa0And the United States will do all we can to ensure that perpetrators of these atrocities are held to account and brought to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And a question about Yemen. \xc2\xa0A Saudi airstrike has killed 119 people in a market. \xc2\xa0Can you categorically say that U.S. targeting or refueling assets weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0For an operational question like this, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0We have expressed our concerns about the loss of innocent life in Yemen. \xc2\xa0The violence there that is plaguing that country has caught too many innocent civilians in the crossfire. \xc2\xa0And it is why we would welcome, and do welcome, the statement from coalition spokesperson, Saudi General Ahmed al-Asiri, who indicated today that major operations in Yemen are coming to an end, and that the coalition will work on \xe2\x80\x9clong-term plans\xe2\x80\x9d to bring stability to the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have long made the case that Yemen is in dire need of a political solution and that that political solution needs to come as soon as possible. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to urge all parties to return to U.N.-facilitated peace talks so that we can build upon the positive conversations that occurred back in December. \xc2\xa0We need to find a way forward for those conversations to bring the fighting in Yemen to an end. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be supportive of that process and continue to urge all parties to participate constructively in it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I take what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying about the coalition statement. \xc2\xa0But the Saudis have offered to wind down -- or said they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wind down this conflict before, and then haven\'t really followed through. \xc2\xa0Do you have any assurances that this time war really is coming to end, or slowing down?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to continue to monitor the situation there. \xc2\xa0There are some initial reports of de-escalation along the Saudi-Yemen border. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re also pleased to see coalition indications that they\xe2\x80\x99re working on efforts to deliver critically needed humanitarian assistance to a number of Yemeni villages along the Saudi-Yemen border. \xc2\xa0So these are preliminary indications. \xc2\xa0I would readily acknowledge that, Andrew. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage all sides to engage in the kind of diplomatic conversations that could bring the fighting in that war-torn country to an end.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the genocide issue, it sounds like nothing really is going to change on the ground in terms of the strategy -- because as I heard from the State Department as well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. position that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been executing this war, this conflict, or whatever it is, as if it were a genocide anyway. \xc2\xa0This is just a formal declaration. \xc2\xa0So nothing really changes. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not like you have to -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like you have to escalate anything to now deal with a genocide?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, quite frankly, we have been aware for some time of ISIL targeting religious minorities. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken action -- significant actions to try to prevent it. \xc2\xa0And that includes efforts by ISIL fighters to target Christians just because of their religion. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not at all suggesting that this judgment that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached by the State Department is somehow unimportant. \xc2\xa0It is significant any time you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about applying this label. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that robust action has already been taken by the United States and our coalition partners to try to protect the religious minorities that we already know are being targeted by ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Reporting on the Austin fundraiser, it sounds like the President did endorse Secretary Clinton, or said essentially that the race was going to come to an end soon; Sanders is not going sustainable. \xc2\xa0Is that a turning point? \xc2\xa0Is that was he, in fact, said?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not what he, in fact, said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, what did he say, for the record?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I was there for the fundraiser and I was there for the part where this conversation occurred. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say in general is that President Obama made a case that would be familiar to all of you, which is that as Democrats move through this competitive primary process, we need to be mindful of the fact that our success in November in electing a Democratic President will depend on the commitment and ability of the Democratic Party to come together behind our nominee. \xc2\xa0And the President did not indicate or specify a preference in the race. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President pointed out something that he\xe2\x80\x99s pointed out to all of you, which is that both of the Democrats who are running because they have demonstrated an understanding and a commitment to building on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made thus far would be far better Presidents than anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s been put up on the Republican side.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So nothing has changed. \xc2\xa0He is still neutral, can\xe2\x80\x99t make up his mind, taking a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did not say that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make up his mind. \xc2\xa0The President has cast a ballot. \xc2\xa0The President has voted in the Illinois Democratic Primary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And he voted for? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We have not indicated that preference. \xc2\xa0But what we have said and what the President has said, both publicly and privately, is that he will have an important responsibility in the summer and fall, once the nomination process has concluded, in bringing the party together and making sure that even after a vigorous debate, which, the President, by the way, believes is really good for the party -- it was really good for the party in 2008 and this kind of competition is good for sharpening the skills of the candidates and exercising the organizational muscle of the Democratic Party.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut once this process comes to a conclusion, everybody in the Democratic Party will understand the stakes of the debate, and given those stakes, will need to unify behind the Democratic Party nominee to ensure that he or she can win in November.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Flint -- the hearings on the Hill. \xc2\xa0Does the EPA Administrator still have the fully confidence of the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0And I think that you have seen the EPA, at the direction of Administrator McCarthy, take aggressive action to ensure the health, wellbeing, and safety of citizens in Flint, but also citizens in communities all across the country. \xc2\xa0That EPA continues to be deeply involved in testing the water supply there and offering scientific and technical expertise and advice to local officials as they try to rectify the problems there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because there was a long period where I think your explanation was that the EPA couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything, it was the responsibility of the state authorities to act first. \xc2\xa0Is that correct? \xc2\xa0Am I correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, yes, but you just asked me whether or not we had confidence in the leadership of the administrator of the EPA, and I\xe2\x80\x99m describing to you all of the steps that have been taken to safeguard the water supply not just in Flint but in communities all across the country. \xc2\xa0The EPA Administrator sent a letter to governors, coast to coast, saying that they need to clarify exactly how they are implementing the Lead and Copper Rule to make sure that nothing has fallen through the cracks and that if there is some inattention to these important rules and enforcing them, that the EPA will be prepared to act to plug those gaps, to make sure that we can protect the water supply of communities across the country. \xc2\xa0She understands how serious this is, and the truth is, when you take a look at the record that she has compiled just in her few years as the Administrator of the EPA, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong case to make that the United States of America has never had a better administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency than Gina McCarthy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on the governor? \xc2\xa0There have been calls for him to resign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what we have indicated is that, obviously, the citizens and voters of the state of Michigan are going to have to decide who they want to lead their state. \xc2\xa0And, frankly, this is another example of where we can\xe2\x80\x99t let our partisan differences with Governor Snyder interfere with our ability to respond to an urgency situation in a community of about 100,000 people in Michigan. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the federal government mobilize significant resources from FEMA to provide water filters and to distribute bottled water. \xc2\xa0That\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen HHS announce significant grant funding to enhance health care and medical assistance in this community. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen commitments to expand educational opportunities, Head Start centers in that community who\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with this crisis. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we\'ve done all of that, despite the fact that the governor from the state of Michigan represents a different political party. \xc2\xa0This is too important for politics. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, overall, the President is satisfied with the response to date?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think overall, the President recognizes that what happened in Flint was a tragedy, and this is something that is going to have long-term consequences for the health and well-being of many, many families there. \xc2\xa0And it is incumbent upon state, local and federal officials to mobilize necessary resources to try to meet these needs and fix what was so badly broken. \xc2\xa0And that includes needing additional action from Congress to appropriate the necessary resources so that some of the significant infrastructure flaws can be addressed as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around. \xc2\xa0Atsushi, how are you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Good. \xc2\xa0Thank you so much. \xc2\xa0Let me ask about Asia, specifically on North Korea. \xc2\xa0The President signed an executive order yesterday to put fresh sanctions against North Korean companies and individuals in Korean mining corporations and banking corporations. \xc2\xa0And in terms of the implementation of the sanctions, as we all know, the coordination with Chinese is essential. \xc2\xa0So my question is, the United States government, the administration has already launched a consultation with China in terms of the implementation of the sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s a good question. \xc2\xa0We have talked since we saw the North Korea nuclear test and the subsequent test of ballistic missile technology there. \xc2\xa0We\'ve acknowledged that our success in applying additional pressure on the North Korean government would depend upon the effective cooperation of Chinese authorities. \xc2\xa0The reason for that is that China has a rather unique relationship with North Korea. \xc2\xa0The North Korean economy is more dependent on the Chinese economy than any other. \xc2\xa0The relations between the North Korean government and the Chinese government are more integrated than North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s government-to-government relationship with any other country in the world. \xc2\xa0And mobilizing an effective international response would require effective cooperation with Chinese officials.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s what we have succeeded in obtaining. \xc2\xa0And that is why we have been able to put in place sanctions against North Korea that go far beyond sanctions that we put in place against North Korea in the past. \xc2\xa0So this will apply additional pressure not just to the North Korean government but also to the ruling elite in North Korea.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMany members of the ruling elite enjoy rather luxurious lifestyles that seems in quite stark contrast to the suffering of the vast majority of the North Korean population. \xc2\xa0That is a direct result of policy -- immoral policy decisions that are made by the North Korean government. \xc2\xa0And we have looked for ways that we could apply sanctions to maximize the impact they would have on the North Korean ruling elite that is, after all, making the kinds of decisions that are destabilizing the broader region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I believe that the U.S. unilateral sanctions that the President signed last month required the President to investigate any person and entity and individual if there is a suspicion to have a transaction -- a transaction with North Korea. \xc2\xa0So is it fair to say if any person could have illicit transaction with this entity or individual which has been designated yesterday, and this entity would also be punished, including a Chinese company or Chinese national institution, is it fair to say that that party would also be sanctioned?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, you\'re asking a very technical question -- it\'s an entirely legitimate one. \xc2\xa0But my colleagues at the Treasury Department can help you understand exactly what sort of penalties are associated with violating these sanctions. \xc2\xa0But I think the basic crux of your question is one that I can affirmatively answer, which is that the successful implementation of these sanctions will require the United States, Chinese and other countries in the region to coordinate effectively to enforce them. \xc2\xa0And how exactly they\xe2\x80\x99re enforced and what sort of penalties are associated with violating these sanctions are questions that my colleagues at the Treasury Department can answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0You know, I believe that Chinese President Xi Jinping would visit this town later this month for Nuclear Security Summit. Will the President meet in person with President Xi Jinping? \xc2\xa0And I believe if they meet, President Obama will raise concerns on South China Sea issue, and how President Obama raise concerns -- or do you think United States has to take another fresh action against these issues?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The Nuclear Security Summit will convene here in Washington, D.C. at the end of this month. \xc2\xa0We do anticipate that a number of world leaders will travel to the United States to continue working on this priority that President Obama identified early in his first term. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have specific confirmation yet about who will be attending the summit, but as we have more information about that we\'ll let you know. \xc2\xa0I suspect that means the President will spend some time meeting with some of the world leaders who are here, but we\'ll keep you posted on when those meetings get set up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tColleen. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about a report that Cuba is going to return four dissidents to the U.S. \xc2\xa0Did the White House know that this was happening, and was this a requirement ahead of the President visiting Cuba?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Colleen, the United States has been advocating with the Cubans for quite some time the release of political prisoners inside of Cuba. \xc2\xa0So obviously if the reports are true \xc2\xa0-- I\'m not in a position to confirm them -- if they are true, that obviously would be a step that we would welcome. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have any information about where those individuals might travel, if anywhere, outside of Cuba.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is this necessary to happen before the President goes to Cuba?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have been, both before the trip to Cuba was announced and after, have been continuing to urge the Cuban government to more effectively respect and protect the universal human rights of their citizens. \xc2\xa0That includes freeing from prison those who are jailed for no other reason than their political views.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on one other subject, Gallup said last week that President Obama had a 50-percent approval rating, which was his highest in almost three years. \xc2\xa0And I\'m curious what you attribute that to. \xc2\xa0Why do you think his approval ratings are going up at this time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly is possible that in comparison to some of the Republican candidates, that President Obama starts to look pretty good. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I might be biased in making that judgment, but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that that individual poll might be some evidence of that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, look, setting aside the poll numbers -- they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go up and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go down -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- a large portion of the President\xe2\x80\x99s success in office has been predicated on his ability to not try to tailor his individual actions or statements based on day-to-day movements in the polls. \xc2\xa0Many of the most significant successes that we have had have relied upon President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s ability to look beyond just one day\xe2\x80\x99s movement in the polls or one 24-hour news cycle, but rather to chart a longer course by setting long-term goals and ensuring that our eyes are fixed upon those goals over the horizon. \xc2\xa0And that is what allowed us to do things like complete an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon or secure an international climate agreement that resulted in nearly 200 countries making a commitment to reduce their carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut there are even domestic things, too, that would fit this category. \xc2\xa0The President took -- made some significant and politically unpopular decisions very early in his presidency to rescue the auto industry. \xc2\xa0And because of those policies, American workers and auto companies and entrepreneurs and innovators were given an opportunity to lead a resurrection of the American auto industry, and we now see, seven years later, that the American auto industry is stronger than ever. \xc2\xa0They are selling more cars -- they are producing and selling more cars than ever. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, again, if we had just been focused on what was the politically popular decision back in February and March of 2009, the President would not have thrown the American auto industry the kind of lifeline that they needed. \xc2\xa0And as a result of that decision, again, which was politically unpopular at the time, that laid the groundwork for a dramatic resurgence in not just the American auto industry but the American manufacturing sector as a whole.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tStephanie.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House believe that the -- or the President, rather, believe that the longer Bernie Sanders stays in the race, the more likely Hillary Clinton would have trouble defeating the GOP nominee?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn this parallel on a couple of occasions, and I think it is appropriate. \xc2\xa0In 2008, there were many people who were concerned on the Democratic side that the primary context between then Senator Obama and then Senator Clinton was going to last much longer than most people expected. \xc2\xa0And many Democrats were concerned about the potential impact that this could have on the ability of Democrats to win the general election in November, 2008.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tInstead, what we saw is that both candidates steadily improved their performance in the debates and on the campaign trail, and in their stump speeches. \xc2\xa0And what we also saw is we saw that both campaigns were also able to hone their organizational skills. \xc2\xa0Both campaigns were challenged to build political operations in states that Democrats had not traditionally competed for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe best example I have of this is that there was a competitive Democratic primary in Indiana in May of 2008. \xc2\xa0And a lot of Democrats were thinking, we\xe2\x80\x99re in really bad shape if we\xe2\x80\x99re still fighting in May of 2008, especially if we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting over Democratic votes in Indiana. \xc2\xa0But what that actually allowed both campaigns to do was to build really strong political organizations in that state. \xc2\xa0And what that resulted in -- it resulted in a strong Democratic political organization that was in place for the general election in 2008 and the Democratic candidate for President, Barack Obama, won the state of Indiana for the first time in quite some time. \xc2\xa0That was an important victory, and I think it is the clearest example of how a longer-than-expected primary contest can actually make a candidate and a party organization much stronger than anticipated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0Does the President -- has he mentioned anything about the Adam LaRoche story? \xc2\xa0One of his favorite teams. \xc2\xa0They came to him and told him his son is kind of hanging out a little bit too much in the clubhouse. \xc2\xa0Has he made any mention of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t talked to him about that story. \xc2\xa0I had a chance to read it a little bit earlier today. \xc2\xa0I noted that Mr. LaRoche said that his decision to retire was unrelated to that request from the general manager. \xc2\xa0But obviously, I think, if nothing else, it says something pretty powerful about the relationship between Mr. LaRoche and his son. \xc2\xa0And as a relatively new father myself with a son, I hope that I can build a similarly strong relationship like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, we heard Senator Reid today saying that some Republicans are being willing now to meet with nominee Garland, are caving, that there are cracks showing that it\xe2\x80\x99s a breakthrough, even. \xc2\xa0I mean, would you go so far as to say that that seems like that big of a deal that they\xe2\x80\x99re just willing to meet with him at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the observation that I would make as recently as a week or so ago -- the vast majority, if not all senators, were saying that they would not even meet with the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee and would never consider a vote on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0After the President\xe2\x80\x99s eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock announcement yesterday, before I could even get my lunch we had Republicans out there saying that they were ready to meet with him and could imagine voting for him in a lame duck session.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not nearly as far as the Constitution suggests they should go in giving fair consideration to the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0But I do think it represents tangible movement in a positive direction from the previously unreasonable obstructionist position that Republicans have adopted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think some of that might be, though -- if they still say that the endgame is to meet with Garland to let him know that they don\xe2\x80\x99t think now is the right time to do this, that it\xe2\x80\x99s maybe just to save face for the time being or to appear that they\xe2\x80\x99re giving him at least some, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, gentlemanly consideration if they\xe2\x80\x99re not considering him ultimately for the position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, these individual senators are going to have to ultimately make up their mind about whether or not they are willing to fulfill their constitutional duty, or if they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to use politics as an excuse to not do their job. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the simple question. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a pretty clear way to evaluate this because the Senate does at least some of their most important work in public. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a way to tell. \xc2\xa0Are they holding hearings? \xc2\xa0Is the committee taking a vote? \xc2\xa0Is the floor of the United States Senate the venue for every member of the United States Senate to weigh in, or not? \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to judge.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday, you seemed pretty reluctant to -- I mean, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t asked to place odds on it. \xc2\xa0But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want to go so far as to say, you think that this will ultimately happen, that he will ultimately be confirmed. \xc2\xa0But the Chief of Staff today on CNN made it pretty clear that he felt that is exactly what would happen. \xc2\xa0So is that just a difference of opinion within the White House? \xc2\xa0Or is there kind of a shift now towards more confidence that this is actually going to make it all the way through? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, of course the White House is confident. \xc2\xa0We certainly are confident that the nominee that we have put forward merits consideration by the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0The good news is, there are a lot of Republicans who agree with us, including Republicans who still serve in the Senate -- including seven Republicans in the Senate who voted for him the last time that he was up for confirmation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we are confident that he is somebody who deserves fair consideration. \xc2\xa0And look, if they do, he absolutely will be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that. \xc2\xa0So that is why I think that you see a lot of confidence from the White House in the path that we have laid out here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you also have confidence that he will actually be confirmed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do have confidence. \xc2\xa0I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stand up here and make predictions about sort of what the percentage is. \xc2\xa0But there is no doubt that he deserves fair consideration. \xc2\xa0And if given fair consideration, he will be confirmed. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident in that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0On the call today with progressives, the people on the call were urged to get involved and to make their voices heard. \xc2\xa0So what does that really mean? \xc2\xa0What does the White House want these people to be physically doing as this evolves?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President has a lot of passion for this issue and I think that was on display in the Rose Garden yesterday and I think that was evident in the message that he delivered on the conference call today. \xc2\xa0And the President is hoping that people across the country who share his passion, who believe that the -- an appointment to the Supreme Court should transcend politics, that the Senate should fulfill its constitutional duty, and if people share the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion on this issue then they should make their voices heard, and they can do that in a variety of ways. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What does the White House feel would be effective? \xc2\xa0So you state your case every single day, so there could be millions of Americans out there who feel the same way -- what do you want those people to be doing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we obviously believe that people should be engaged in the process. \xc2\xa0They should sort of understand exactly what the stakes are. \xc2\xa0And if they feel strongly about it in the same way that the President does, they should make their voices heard in public. \xc2\xa0We would strongly support that. \xc2\xa0And if that means contacting their member of Congress or contacting an organization that is interested in this issue, then, again, we would encourage them to be engaged in the process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you want people out there to be calling these Republican Senators?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that certainly is one option that is available to people. \xc2\xa0But, ultimately, people are going to have to decide for themselves what they want to do to make their voices heard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can I come back to Cuba? \xc2\xa0Speaker Ryan spoke out about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip today and specifically about some of the steps that have been taken in the last few weeks -- ease travel and trade restrictions, and such. \xc2\xa0He said perhaps the President needs reminding that this is a major human rights abuser that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to visit, and specifically that these deals are going to further legitimize and even benefit the Cuban government. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think my response to that is just simply that the policy that Speaker Ryan ostensibly supports that was in place before President Obama announced a change in his policy was a policy that failed. \xc2\xa0That policy had been in place for more than five decades, and it had not brought about any of the kinds of changes that we would like to see on the island of Cuba. \xc2\xa0The President has decided it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a different approach, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for an approach that involves greater engagement between the United States and Cuba, both on people-to-people level, but also on a level -- on an economic level. \xc2\xa0And that that greater engagement, which is, by the way, strongly supported by an overwhelming majority of Cuban citizens, is one that we believe will eventually lead to the kinds of changes in Cuba that we would like to see. \xc2\xa0More importantly, it will lead to the kinds of changes that the Cuban people would like to see. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented these changes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I also want to ask about the meeting with the dissidents that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary. \xc2\xa0I know you said that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to choose who comes to it. \xc2\xa0So does that specifically mean that the White House had a list of people it invited, and every single person on that list will be able to come to that meeting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what it means is it means that we will be the ones that do the inviting, and it means that the United States will not be checking with the Cuban government in advance to determine if they\xe2\x80\x99re okay with us inviting that individual to participate in the meeting. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll be issuing the invites, and the President will be making the decision about with whom he meets, and that will be done without any interference by the Cuban government. \xc2\xa0And we will, as the meeting gets closer, be able to talk to you about who exactly will participate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand that. \xc2\xa0Does that mean that you have assurances from the Cuban government that whoever you invite can come?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking to the Cuban government about our list. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make the invites based on who we believe the President should interact with and the President is looking forward to this opportunity. \xc2\xa0I think it sends a pretty strong signal about the commitment and priority that he has placed on a respect for basic human rights, including people who have different political views than the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0On Turkey, Josh, you talked about Turkey last week as well. \xc2\xa0And just today, after you talked about Zaman newspaper, the biggest newspaper seized. \xc2\xa0Today, there\xe2\x80\x99s an indictment at the second best-selling newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s owner, now ask for 23 years of jail sentence. \xc2\xa0My first question -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two questions -- my first question is, do you think NATO ally, U.S. friend, is, under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s watch, losing its democratic character?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start by saying that Turkey is a NATO ally, and the United States takes our obligations to our NATO allies seriously. \xc2\xa0And the nation of Turkey in the last several weeks has been plagued by terrorist activity, including violence perpetrated by terrorists against innocent civilians. \xc2\xa0And the United States stands with our NATO ally in Turkey as they confront those terrorists. \xc2\xa0We also stand with them as they assert their right to defend themselves. \xc2\xa0And we have also found it effective and valuable to our counter-ISIL effort to be able to draw upon the important contributions that Turkey has made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTurkey has made progress in sealing the border between Turkey and Syria. \xc2\xa0That has had a tangible impact on the ability of ISIL to move foreign fighters from around the world to Syria. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive thing. \xc2\xa0We have also secured an agreement from Turkey to allow the United States and coalition aircraft to use military facilities and airbases inside of Turkey to more efficiently and more effectively carry out military operations against ISIL targets in Syria. \xc2\xa0All of that is positive and important. \xc2\xa0At the same time, the United States continues to be troubled by the Turkish government\xe2\x80\x99s use of appointed trustees to shut down or interfere with the editorial operations of media outlets that are sometimes critical to government. \xc2\xa0Court-ordered supervision of a media company\xe2\x80\x99s finances and operations should not prompt changes to the newsroom or to a news organization\xe2\x80\x99s editorial policies. \xc2\xa0We call on the Turkish government to ensure full respect for due process and equal treatment under the law. \xc2\xa0And in a democratic society, critical opinions should be encouraged, not silenced. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we urge Turkish authorities to ensure their actions uphold the universal, democratic values enshrined in Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s constitution, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one more. \xc2\xa0You just talked about freedom of speech. \xc2\xa0There is a petition signed by 1,100 academics in Turkey, including some of the U.S. -- dissidents from U.S. as well. \xc2\xa0And now hundreds of these academics are under trial. \xc2\xa0Some of them got fired, suspended. \xc2\xa0And 700 or 600 of them are under investigation just because they signed the letter. \xc2\xa0So my question is, since President Erdogan is scheduled to come to Washington, D.C. -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not confirmed -- if he comes, or if in Ankara, do you think the U.S. needs to raise these human rights issues with Ankara more forcefully, considering we know that President Obama did not raise these issues in recent meetings in Antalya or Paris?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just say generally that the Obama administration has followed in the footsteps of previous administrations here in the United States of advocating for universal human rights around the world. \xc2\xa0And President Obama routinely, in his meetings with leaders around the world, continues to impress upon those leaders how much of a priority we place on respecting basic universal human rights, including freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly. \xc2\xa0These are priorities for the United States both in terms of them being closely held values here at home, but also in terms of the way that we advocate for those values around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in our conversations across the government, with our Turkish counterparts, it is not at all uncommon for us to continue to advocate for those values and continue to urge the Turkish government to do a better job of respecting those basic human rights. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, we have frequent conversations with the Turkish government because we are able to effectively coordinate with them on a range of issues, particularly issues that are critical to U.S. national security. \xc2\xa0And we value that coordination and our ability to cooperate with the Turks, particularly when it comes to our counter-ISIL cooperation. \xc2\xa0But that does not in any way lessen our commitment to standing up for the kinds of universal human rights that we believe should be protected not just here in the United States but around the world, particularly inside the borders of some of our closest allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a couple of questions. \xc2\xa0I want to go back to Flint and something that Ron had asked you about the calls for the government to step down. \xc2\xa0Is there some kind of unwritten rule or a written rule that you never asked for someone to resign or elected officials to resign? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking because that has been brought to you before about other elected officials.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If there\xe2\x80\x99s an unwritten rule, no one has ever communicated it to me. \xc2\xa0Off the top of my head, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can recall a situation in which I called on somebody to resign from here. \xc2\xa0But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule that out, I guess. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I guess it will just depend on if I wake up on the wrong side of the bed one morning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The day is young.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll just be demanding resignation letters everywhere.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking because --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done that at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking because we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you in the past, and most recently with Rahm Emanuel. \xc2\xa0And I just wondered if there was some kind of rule that you guys had here. \xc2\xa0Now, on that subject, Congressman Elijah Cummings is calling for him, the governor of Michigan to step down because of \xe2\x80\x9cgrave revelations\xe2\x80\x9d that they found after listening to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s testimony. \xc2\xa0He called him an absentee governor, and he saw signs and he ignored them. \xc2\xa0With that, is there any blame to be laid on the governor of Michigan when it comes to this long, ongoing issue where there is going to be, some are saying, a lost generation because of this poison that was in the water?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, any time you have a problem that is this significant, that occurs on the watch of state and local officials, accountability is important. \xc2\xa0And there is an ongoing investigation -- I believe more than one -- to look at exactly what happened and what led to this significant failure. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to avoid weighing in on aspects of that investigation that could be perceived as interfering with it. \xc2\xa0But obviously, accountability is important, particularly when we\'re talking about the health and wellbeing of thousands of American citizens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the gravity of this whole situation? \xc2\xa0Where does the blame lie? \xc2\xa0Even beyond, yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation, but from what we\'ve seen -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard people have been sick. \xc2\xa0I mean, there are medical reports that children are going to have problems down the road, long-term effects. \xc2\xa0You still have a water issue still there. \xc2\xa0Where does the blame lie?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, I guess this is part of what the investigation is looking to uncover, is to determine how we actually got to this point. \xc2\xa0What I will tell you, I guess, to try to answer your question is the President certainly feels a responsibility to ensure that government resources are mobilized to assist those who have been harmed. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a significant commitment of resources on the part of the federal government -- everything from the delivery of bottled water and water filters to stepped-up health care services. \xc2\xa0All of that the President feels is a responsibility of the federal government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUltimately, it\'s state and local officials, though, who have to make some of the policy decisions to rectify the situation. \xc2\xa0There certainly are additional resources that can and should be appropriated by Congress so the federal government can support the improvement and overhaul of the infrastructure inside of Flint. \xc2\xa0So there certainly is an important role for the federal government to play to try to address the situation and try to assist those who have been harmed by it. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to who exactly made a mistake, and what are the mistakes they\xe2\x80\x99ve made so we can avoid them other places, that continues to be under investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another subject -- Judge Merrick Garland. \xc2\xa0If you can give us a little bit of insight or as much insight as you can as to the conversations with him about the uphill battle. \xc2\xa0I mean, I know he knew going in that this was going to be an uphill battle, but can you talk about the conversations here at the White House about what would be needed to convince senators, how he would have to put his elbow in this a little bit more, and how you guys might help him -- just talk to us about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Chief Judge Garland has been around for a long time. \xc2\xa0And he has seen that questions about confirming a Supreme Court nominee are tough. \xc2\xa0This is supposed to be a rigorous process. \xc2\xa0There should be a debate. \xc2\xa0There should be hearings in which senators from both sides of the aisle are asking probing questions of the nominee, inquiring about their record and inquiring about the way they believe that a Supreme Court justice should do his or her job. \xc2\xa0And those are difficult, nuanced questions, but those are questions that should be asked and those are questions that should be answered.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so Chief Judge Garland is not at all surprised that when he agreed to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee that he was signing up for an arduous task. \xc2\xa0But the kind of responsibility that we give to someone who gets a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court is significant, and that\'s why it\'s appropriate for the Senate to play this important role of asking some pretty tough questions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there any advice from this White House to Garland to tell him how to handle this different process, the process the people are refusing to offer him? \xc2\xa0Did this White House offer him any advice?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of. \xc2\xa0Look, all confirmation battles are tough. \xc2\xa0And it\'s supposed to be that way. \xc2\xa0I guess our point is Senate Republicans should go through the process. \xc2\xa0Right now they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, we\'re not going to do our job, we\'re not going to ask him tough questions, we\'re not even going to meet with him. \xc2\xa0That\'s inappropriate, and that indicates a willingness on the part of Republicans to put politics ahead of their constitutional duties. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t think that\'s something that most Americans are willing to stand for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Next question. \xc2\xa0I understand that there was a meeting today on the Hill. \xc2\xa0Many African American leaders who support the President are still very angry about the fact that there was not an African American named as the nominee for this position. \xc2\xa0Could you talk to us about the meeting -- who was there, what was it? \xc2\xa0Was it a terse meeting? \xc2\xa0Can you give us information on this meeting today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, I\'m sorry to disappoint you, but I can tell you that Valerie Jarrett did spend some time with members of the Congressional Black Caucus up on Capitol Hill, and everyone who attended that meeting indicated their strong support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise; we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that from other leaders in the civil rights community. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere were some comments from former Attorney General Holder that I would call to your attention. \xc2\xa0Mr. Holder said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a person,\xe2\x80\x9d -- referring to Chief Judge Garland -- \xe2\x80\x9cI think who has worked hard to keep communities safe, bring dangerous criminals to justice. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s also a person who showed compassion. \xc2\xa0He comes from humble beginnings. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s a person who left a pretty prestigious partnership here in Washington, D.C. to work in the U.S. Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office that I ultimately headed, and got down here, worked with people in this community to make them and to keep them safe. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holder went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\xe2\x80\x99s a guy who I think is eminently qualified.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And he observed, as I have on many occasions, that no one has taken any shots at him. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut Mr. Holder is not the only person. \xc2\xa0We saw some comments in a news release from Wade Henderson, who leads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \xc2\xa0And he was pretty direct. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cChief Judge Garland is the most well-prepared Supreme Court nominee in generations.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And he went on to say that \xe2\x80\x9cwe will mobilize our massive network of civil rights advocates, legal scholars and everyday people who care about democracy and our Constitution to make sure that the Senate does its job.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe obviously are pleased to see that Chief Judge Garland is getting such strong support from leaders in the civil rights community. \xc2\xa0He deserves it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President had the meeting yesterday with the leaders right after he left the Rose Garden in the Roosevelt Room, and then why have to go to Capitol Hill today to talk to the leaders? \xc2\xa0I mean, can you tell me why? \xc2\xa0I mean, if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t angry about this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you is that everybody that Valerie met with today -- that included a number of CBC members -- expressed their strong support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to put forward Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0And they share the President\xe2\x80\x99s confidence that he would serve this country with honor and distinction on the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we were obviously gratified by that response, but that response is by no means unique. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that kind of strong support from a variety of corners in the civil rights community. And that support is quite well-justified.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on what April was asking, was the meeting set up just to sort of bridge the gap in case there were any bruised feelings based on this election of Chief Judge Garland?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that Ms. Jarrett regularly interacts with members of the Congressional Black Caucus. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else was on her agenda when she traveled up there to visit with them, but obviously given the news and obviously given the significance of this decision and the significance of the Republican refusal to even consider this nomination, this was something that was discussed extensively in the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me also ask you about something Senator Chuck Schumer said today. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn refusing to even give Chief Judge Garland an up or down vote, Republicans are essentially saying that we would rather take our chances with a Trump nomination or with a Clinton nomination to the High Court. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do think that it definitely leads Republicans, at least rhetorically, into a box canyon. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that somehow a President Trump, whom they vowed to run attack ads against to prevent him from being elected President, or a President Hillary Clinton, whom they have made no bones about the fact that they do not support, would do a better job of appointing Supreme Court justices than President Obama, despite the fact that many Republicans currently serving in the Senate have twice supported President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s appointments to the Supreme Court, and despite the fact that President Obama, to fill this third vacancy, has put forward somebody that even Republicans themselves acknowledge is a consensus nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTheir argument, to put it bluntly, makes no sense. \xc2\xa0And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t really heard anybody try to explain it, but I think, going back to Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question, I think this is why you see some confidence in the White House today. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing a coherent explanation on the part of Republicans for why they have taken such an unreasonable position to even consider the nomination of Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s quite a strong argument for why they should do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there are concerns about his positions on abortion, about his positions on the Second Amendment in particular. \xc2\xa0So you can understand why there might be some hesitance among conservatives about his candidacy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, Senator Hatch is certainly a conservative. \xc2\xa0I think he described himself that way, and I think most other people would describe him that way, too. \xc2\xa0And he described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee and somebody that he strongly supports.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the other point, Kevin, though, is this is why we should have hearings. \xc2\xa0So if people want to raise these kinds of concerns and they want to ask Chief Judge Garland about his writings on these topics, that\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely legitimate line of inquiry. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why we have hearings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m not just suggesting that Republicans should be able to ask these questions. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting that Chief Judge Garland should appear in public on camera under oath, and spend hours answering those questions. \xc2\xa0He has an obligation to do that. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to do that. \xc2\xa0And I think when he does, he will demonstrate the kind of wisdom and judgment and commitment to the law that we would expect from somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be given a responsibility as significant as serving on the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0I want to follow up on the conversations about Administrator McCarthy. \xc2\xa0Is it your feeling or is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s feeling that she\xe2\x80\x99s done everything right in the circumstance as it relates to what has happened in Flint, Michigan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think in some ways, for her performance, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you to ask her. \xc2\xa0She obviously is in a position to best assess what decisions that she made, and if there are some things that she wishes she had done differently, then you should ask her about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I will tell you is that she has acted aggressively to do two things. \xc2\xa0The first is to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re mobilizing the kind of scientific and technical advice that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to restore as quickly as possible a clean water supply in Flint. \xc2\xa0The other thing that she has done is she has reached out to governors from coast to coast to be crystal clear about what exactly they need to do to enforce the Lead and Copper Rule to make sure that what happened in Flint doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again. \xc2\xa0And she has vowed that if state and local officials who do have primary responsibility fail to fulfill their constitutional -- or fail to fulfill their responsibility, that the EPA will not hesitate to step in and act to protect the safety and wellbeing of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But has the rule changed? \xc2\xa0Because if I remember, at least the way it was described to me by you, it was, well, the state has an obligation to sort of make a decision, the EPA gets information based on testing, and they might say, well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an issue but it\xe2\x80\x99s a state\xe2\x80\x99s call. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, has the process changed along with the rhetoric, which is now saying, hey, listen, we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to change, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do things differently? \xc2\xa0Has there been something substantive that I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware if there\xe2\x80\x99s been a specific rule change that\xe2\x80\x99s been initiated. \xc2\xa0I think what the letter was intended to do -- and I think it has done -- it has removed any ambiguity within the rule about how it can and should be enforced, and what the EPA will do if it\xe2\x80\x99s not. \xc2\xa0And I think part of the problem here is that there was some ambiguity about that, but that ambiguity has been removed because of the decisive actions that are taken by Administrator McCarthy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, on that same topic, you said ask Administrator McCarthy, who actually testified today and said that the EPA should have done more to head off the crisis. \xc2\xa0But she repeatedly said she did not have the authority. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99ve said you\xe2\x80\x99re confident in her abilities now. \xc2\xa0Are you confident that now the EPA has the authority and the foresight in order to head off another crisis like this, outside of Flint?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, if she is asking Congress for additional authority, then I hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll listen to her because she knows what she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. \xc2\xa0And if that\'s what she\xe2\x80\x99s asking for, that\'s what she should get. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that in response to this crisis situation, she took decisive action to make sure that in Flint they had access to the scientific and technical advice they need to correct the problems in the water supply. \xc2\xa0And I understand that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working assiduously to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut look, I think her concern that immediately popped to mind is not dissimilar from the kind of concerns I think popped into the minds of many of us, which is that if it\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Flint, is it happening somewhere else.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And that\'s why she sent a letter to governors all across the country and said, look, this is what we\'re going to do to make sure that drinking supplies, water supplies across the country are adequately tested. \xc2\xa0And if there are concerns about the safety of the water supply, these are the steps that we can and should take. \xc2\xa0And to the extent that there is any ambiguity about the way that that rule should be enforced in the past, her letter removes that ambiguity.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But as of -- I understand she can ask for more authority, and it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Congress. \xc2\xa0But as a federal agency, does this building have confidence that the EPA can protect all those other communities from this happening?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are obviously steps that she can take. \xc2\xa0But look, I would -- she can speak to this more effectively than anyone else. \xc2\xa0If she\xe2\x80\x99s saying that she needs more authority from the United States Congress to better protect the health and safety of the American people, then I don\'t understand why Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give it to her.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\'s saying then that there is reason not to be confident.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think Kevin was asking me more a question about her performance as the EPA administrator.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but confidence now that you can prevent another Flint elsewhere in the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, she has taken steps, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that she is using all of the authority that she has. \xc2\xa0But she is in the best position to assess whether or not she needs additional authority to assure all of us that our drinking water remains clean. \xc2\xa0So again, I\xe2\x80\x99d check with her.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0May I ask you, as well, on -- genocide is a significant historical marker to put down there. \xc2\xa0President Clinton had Rwanda. \xc2\xa0President Bush had Sudan. \xc2\xa0Now this administration who has laid out atrocities prevention as a national security concern and a priority has genocide on its watch, ongoing genocide. \xc2\xa0What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that? \xc2\xa0Because that goes in the history books.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, and I think this is a reaction that you can measure dating back to the summer of 2014 when the President ordered military action against ISIL fighters that were targeting religious minorities only because of their religious views.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it didn\'t stop then, and many massacres continued well after that intervention in August.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, but what has also happened is that you\'ve seen more than 10,000 airstrikes be taken against ISIL targets. \xc2\xa0You have seen progress being made by local fighters on the ground, driving ISIL out of territory that they\xe2\x80\x99ve previously held. \xc2\xa0You\'ve seen the President order Special Operations raids against high-value ISIL targets, some of whom were actually involved in hostage taking and in victimizing religious minorities. \xc2\xa0You\'ve seen a coordinated effort to try to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing, some of which included taking religious minorities hostage and selling them for ransom.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou have seen the administration work effectively with the international community to try to confront ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s ability to radicalize and recruit individuals from around the world. \xc2\xa0So our response here has been robust. \xc2\xa0And there has never been an attempt on the part of the administration to try to downplay the significance of these atrocities. \xc2\xa0We have taken them seriously from the beginning. \xc2\xa0And I think because of how serious we think they are, that\'s why the President has ordered such a robust response.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But what you\'re describing is part of the campaign to degrade and destroy and ultimately defeat ISIL as a terrorist organization. \xc2\xa0Historians, the Holocaust Museum, which has been following this and documenting it, would also say, look, there was a different mission between stopping World War II and winning the war and preventing the mass extermination of Jews. \xc2\xa0And there was great regret that more wasn\'t done. \xc2\xa0You\'ve had Presidents following that -- recently President Clinton saying, I wish I had done more in Rwanda.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGiven that and given the acknowledgement that these things are two different issues -- ending a war, winning a war, and defeating a terrorist groups and stopping genocide -- does the administration feel that it could be doing more? \xc2\xa0Not just these air campaigns you\'ve talked about and those choices here and there to intervene to stop mass atrocities when you can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I used those -- those are only two examples that I cited, both at Mount Sinjar and Amerli, because those are concrete examples of the United States military not just using our military power, but also our moral authority to save individuals who are being targeted just because of their religious views.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, I think there is an aspect of your question that I -- the premise of your question that I disagree with, at least a little bit, at least in part. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDegrading and ultimately destroying ISIL is the best way for us to prevent them from carrying out these kinds of atrocities. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way, but it the most effective way for us to definitively ensure that these terrorists aren\xe2\x80\x99t terrorizing religious minorities just because of their religious views.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve also acknowledged is that there is at the root of all of this a political problem that needs to be addressed. \xc2\xa0And there is no denying or downplaying the significance of political leaders speaking out and setting the tone for a political climate that ensures that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t targeted just because of their religious views, or that they\'re not marginalized, that they\'re not victimized because of their religious views. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is part of our effort to bring about a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s to bring about a political leadership inside of Syria that will reflect the will and ambition of the Syrian people, but also make sure that Syria can be governed in a way that represents the diversity of its population.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But when you said there was significant legal implications when my colleagues asked you about that the other day, what are the significant legal implications, if there are any, for military actions that are being carried out now? \xc2\xa0Are you going to target differently fighters who have more than 3,000 sex slaves in their possession? \xc2\xa0Something an airstrike couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really prevent? \xc2\xa0Are you going to do things to intervene on the ground to prevent incidents of mass rape or mass slaughter? \xc2\xa0I mean, tactically speaking, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that airstrikes alone can do. \xc2\xa0So what is the next step?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So let me take apart these two things. \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to describe that airstrikes are certainly the most visible and in some ways among the most impactful aspects of our campaign against ISIL, but there are a whole bunch of other things that we have done to degrade and ultimately destroy that organization. \xc2\xa0We have supported fighters on the ground. \xc2\xa0We have sought to shut down their financing, counter their ability to move foreign fighters into the country, and counter their ability to try to radicalize people around the world to their cause.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have supported the fledgling political government \xe2\x80\x93 political leadership inside of Iraq. \xc2\xa0Prime Minister Abadi has made important steps in unifying that country and governing that country in a way that they can confront this extremist terrorist organization. \xc2\xa0So there\'s a lot that we have done to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL that does make it harder for ISIL to carry out these kinds of abhorrent atrocities. \xc2\xa0This is something that we take seriously and this judgment from the State Department reflects just how serious this situation is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So just to button it up, you believe that the administration has succeeded in its mission to actively prevent atrocities?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is no doubt that there are atrocities that have been prevented because of actions that this administration has taken and that this President has ordered -- there\'s no denying that. \xc2\xa0But our work is not going to be done and ISIL will continue to be a danger to the region and to religious minorities in the region as long as they continue to exist. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why the President is determined to lead an international coalition to degrade and destroy them.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to go back briefly to the Austin fundraiser and the President\'s comments. \xc2\xa0In the New York Times\' account of his remarks, it said that the President talked specifically about the issue of authenticity; that while Clinton might not come across to voters with the same level of authenticity as Senator Sanders, that shouldn\'t be the only criteria under which voters judge the Democratic candidates. \xc2\xa0Since you were there, could you illuminate how accurate that is as a description of what the President conveyed to the group?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to get into the President\'s private comments. \xc2\xa0I recognize that there are some people who have talked about those private comments, but I\'m not going to do that from here. \xc2\xa0The President has made a forceful case, frankly, about the kind of campaign that Senator Sanders has run. \xc2\xa0And the President has noted that Senator Sanders deserves a lot of credit for the passion that he has inspired among Democrats all across the country. \xc2\xa0And Senator Sanders is talking about deeply held views and doing it in a way that deeply resonates with people, and that\'s a testament to his skills as a leader and as a politician, and as somebody who has got his values in the right place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has also talked about Secretary Clinton and her leadership abilities, and the way that she has drawn her own passionate following. \xc2\xa0The historic nature of her candidacy certainly has something to do with it, but so does her track record of fighting for the kinds of values and advancing the kinds of values that Democrats have long championed. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the President feels especially fortunate to be in a party that can actually be proud of its presidential candidates, and doesn\'t have to spend all its time trying to figure out a way to put distance between his party\'s candidates. \xc2\xa0We find that Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. spend a lot of time doing that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the truth is they haven\'t done it enough, because even in those times when they do try to put some distance between themselves and their leading presidential candidate, they continue to insist that they\'ll support him if he is their party\'s nominee for President. \xc2\xa0And for the life of me, I don\'t understand how they reconcile those views. \xc2\xa0And I think there are a lot of Americans who are also scratching their heads when they hear those declarations, too. \xc2\xa0I\'m not the only one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnita.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I actually was going to ask about the same thing. \xc2\xa0You said you won\'t comment, but the New York Times story says the White House confirmed it. \xc2\xa0Your response now indicates you\'re not confirming it but you\'re not denying it, either. \xc2\xa0If they\'re not true, what they\'re saying the President said, wouldn\'t you just say they\'re not true?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m doing my best to help you cover this story but I\'m not going to be in a position to walk through every statement as I remember it from five days ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you let the pool in to every event, then we wouldn\'t have to ask.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good news, Anita -- the pool was there for the beginning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not for these comments, though.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But allowing the pool into an event that is hosted in a private home represents an advance for transparency that the previous administration didn\'t respect.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask you another quick question. \xc2\xa0Yesterday you mentioned a couple or few of the Republican senators that I think were either meeting -- you can clarify this -- or agreeing to talk on the phone with Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us what the update is? \xc2\xa0Do you have a number of Republican senators that have met with him or agreed to meet with him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, so there are two meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing today. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Senator Leahy I believe at 2:30 p.m., and then Senator Reid at 4:00 p.m. today. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll do those meetings up on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there are additional meetings that have been scheduled at this point, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to keep you in the loop on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChief Judge Garland did have an opportunity to make some phone calls yesterday. \xc2\xa0One of those phone calls was placed to Chairman Grassley. \xc2\xa0And in conjunction with that phone, there was a conversation between White House staff and members of Chairman Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s staff about arranging a meeting. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do after the recess. \xc2\xa0And look, I anticipate that there will be additional meetings. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the comments that I cited yesterday were just public comments from individual members of the Senate who are Republican, who, to varying degrees, indicated a willingness to have a conversation with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0So Senator Ayotte, Senator Collins, Senator Flake, Senator Portman, Senator Kirk, Senator Inhofe, Senator Grassley and Senator Cochran -- what many of those people have in common is they actually voted for his confirmation to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals back in 1997. \xc2\xa0But we certainly will be in touch, if we haven\'t already, with all these offices to set up those meetings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOlivier, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On keeping with tradition, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you two. \xc2\xa0Following up on Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question about the dissident meeting in Cuba, are any of the dissidents that the President would like to meet with currently in government custody?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest, Olivier, I haven\'t seen the list of people that the President is planning to meet with. \xc2\xa0But we can have that discussion once we put out the list of people that the President is planning to meet with.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then following up on Darlene and Margaret on the genocide question, I guess the way I would phrase it is, can you identify an aspect of the American military campaign against the Islamic State that will change as a result of this determination?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I was asked this question quite a bit in advance of the work that was being done at the State Department on this. \xc2\xa0And I indicated that even without that State Department decision having been made, the President had ordered robust military action. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s because we acknowledged, even without a formal announcement from the State Department, that religious minorities in Iraq and in Syria were being targeted by ISIL. \xc2\xa0And that was an affront on all people of faith -- or an affront to all people of faith. \xc2\xa0And the President ordered action to try to stop it. \xc2\xa0And those actions will continue unabated, and they would continue whether or not there was an announcement and a pretty powerful speech from the Secretary of State today or not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That sounds like a no. \xc2\xa0But when you talk about cooperating with independent investigations on the ground, I can envision a scenario in which maybe that means having American troops spend more time on the ground to collect evidence of atrocities than they currently are, building more of a case and supporting those efforts differently. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not hearing you say that. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at whether there\xe2\x80\x99s any concrete change here. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say in response to a bunch of colleagues, basically no. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there will be additional requests that are made of U.S. military personnel to be involved in this effort. \xc2\xa0You can check with the Department of Defense about that. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there are a bunch of resources that we can bring to bear on this. \xc2\xa0And we will be supportive -- strongly supportive of an independent international effort to hold those accountable for carrying out atrocities like we see in Iraq and in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGeorge, this is St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day. \xc2\xa0I feel like I should not pass over you today. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the final one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And actually, it involves St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your reaction to two statements made since Gerry Adams was blocked from entering the White House on Tuesday. \xc2\xa0Mr. Adams said that \xe2\x80\x9csome in this administration treat Sinn F\xc3\xa9in differently,\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested they\xe2\x80\x99d like to relegate Sinn F\xc3\xa9in to the back of the bus. \xc2\xa0And then Congressman Brendan Boyle asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there something sinister going on at the White House other than the security?\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is no policy decision that related to the difficulty that Mr. Adams encountered at the White House gate. \xc2\xa0This is probably not different than difficulty that all of you have encountered at the White House gate on one occasion or another. \xc2\xa0I think the Secret Service spoke to this and indicated that there was a mistake that they worked to rectify, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t about to rectify it in sufficient time, based on Mr. Adams\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there any contact between the White House and Sinn F\xc3\xa9in or Adams about it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s been a subsequent conversation to apologize. \xc2\xa0I saw that the Secret Service, at least in one published report, did indicate that they regretted what had happened and offered him an apology. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that was just a public statement or if they\xe2\x80\x99d reached out to him personally. \xc2\xa0But I can assure you there was no policy decision to in any way inhibit his ability to participate in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s festivities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:30 P.M.
