Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:55 P.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kind of feels like Monday, weirdly.\xc2\xa0 My kids still haven\'t gone to school this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGood afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I hope you\'re holding up in the wintry weather, today\xe2\x80\x99s cold.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I\'d like to tell you that this morning the President and Vice President held a meeting in the Oval Office with Attorney General Holder, Secretaries Hagel, Sebelius and Duncan, and senior administration officials to discuss their commitment to combating rape and sexual assault in all settings.\xc2\xa0 During the meeting the President and Vice President reiterated their deep, personal interest in doing everything possible to root out these types of abuse and build on the steps their administration has taken to protect Americans from it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey discussed the findings of a report issued by the White House Council on Women and Girls that was issued earlier today and identifies key areas to focus on as part of these continued efforts, including working to change social norms, improving criminal justice response, and protecting students from sexual assault.\xc2\xa0 Each of the Cabinet members briefed the President and Vice President on various actions their respective agencies are taking to lead a coordinated, comprehensive effort to combat sexual assault from the military to college campuses and beyond.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd later today, the President and Vice President and these Cabinet officials will join additional representatives of the Council on Women and Girls for a meeting in the East Room -- which I think you know -- where the President will sign a new presidential memorandum to establish the White House Task Force on Protecting Students from Sexual Assault.\xc2\xa0 In his meeting this morning, the President said that he looks forward to seeing recommendations from the task force within 90 days.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWorking to combat rape and sexual assault in all settings has been a priority for the President and Vice President throughout their time in office, and these new efforts build on steps that this administration has taken to combat these crimes, including last year\xe2\x80\x99s reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which the Vice President himself authored, and the series of executive actions that Secretary Hagel recently announced to address sexual assault in the military.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, I take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple questions about Iran and Syria.\xc2\xa0 I know the State Department has talked about this over the weekend, but what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of what happened with the Ban Ki-moon invitation to Iran to the Syria talks and then having to pull that invitation back?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the U.N. Secretary General for more detail about this.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken to it and explained.\xc2\xa0 Our position never changed and remains today what it has always been, which in order to participate in the Geneva conference you need to endorse the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of the Geneva II conference is the full implementation of that communique, including the establishment by mutual consent of a transitional governing body with full executive authorities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I would refer you to what Secretary General Ban has said on this issue.\xc2\xa0 Our position is clear.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re certainly following events in Montreux now as that conference has gotten underway.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that any tension that was created through this invitation and pulling back the invitation might bleed over into the nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have made clear and the P5-plus-1 in general have made clear that the focus of the implementation of the Joint Plan of Action and of the next step, the six-month process of trying to reach a comprehensive resolution of this matter, is on how we can persuade Iran to abide by its international commitments, how we can ensure that Iran will not obtain and cannot obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 There are other issues, very serious ones, in the Iran account that we have and that includes our profound differences over Syria and the fact that Iran has clearly played a negative role there and a violent role there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on those talks, they\xe2\x80\x99re off to a bit of a rocky start.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration see this round, Geneva II, as sort of the last, best chance to get Assad out?\xc2\xa0 And if this round of talks ends without a positive conclusion, where does the discussion on Syria go from here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I\xe2\x80\x99d note that this is the beginning of what will be a tough and complicated negotiation to end the war in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The meetings in Montreux are ongoing and the start of the Syria-Syria negotiations will begin on Friday in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 That is where the two parties themselves are negotiating.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe international community is focused on the full implementation of the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9, including the establishment, based on mutual consent, of a transitional governing body exercising full executive powers, as I just said, including over military and security entities.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to be clear:\xc2\xa0 Mutual consent for a transitional governing body means that that government cannot be formed with someone who is objected to by one side or the other.\xc2\xa0 In other words, that means that Bashar al-Assad will not and cannot be part of that transition government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the most important work will be done in the coming days, weeks, and months ahead with the regime and the opposition sitting down together to negotiate the implementation of the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9 and the formation of that transitional governing body, and that will be hard work.\xc2\xa0 But today is the beginning of an important process that will hopefully lead to an end to that terrible war.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given how hard it\xe2\x80\x99s been to get these parties to even come to the table, do you see this as really the last, best chance to have a political solution?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no alternative to a political solution, a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\'t, as these talks are just starting, move ahead to an assumption that they\xe2\x80\x99ll fail -- although I will recognize, as we all will and the President will, that this is going to be tough and complicated work.\xc2\xa0 But there is no alternative.\xc2\xa0 There is no other way forward for Syria absent a negotiated political settlement; absent a settlement based on the principles of the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9, which calls very clearly for a transitional governing body that is reached to by mutual consent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard work, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important that it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten started.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke yesterday with President Putin of Russia and your readout said that they discussed the Olympics and security.\xc2\xa0 What more would the White House like to see Russia doing on security there?\xc2\xa0 And what more would the United States like to do or to be involved in to address the mounting concerns about security in Sochi?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that starting with the call yesterday that the United States has offered its full support and any assistance to the Russian government in its security preparations for the Sochi Games.\xc2\xa0 Russian authorities will be responsible for overall security at the Olympics, and the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau of Diplomatic Security has the security lead for United States.\xc2\xa0 We will send diplomatic security and FBI agents to liaise with host nation security and law enforcement officials.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s standard operating procedure for large events like this, where thousands of U.S. citizens -- athletes from Team USA, American corporate sponsors and members of the U.S. media are present for an extended period of time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the United States and Russia have had discussions on counterterrorism cooperation in a number of venues, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted in the past, including in working groups of the Bilateral Presidential Commission.\xc2\xa0 The United States has also been working with the Russian government through the International Security Events Group on Sochi preparation, specifically as we do with any host country.\xc2\xa0 Now, U.S. citizens planning to attend the games in Sochi should be contact with the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Potential threats to safety and security can be found on the embassy\xe2\x80\x99s website and the Department of State\xe2\x80\x99s travel website.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll also note that we have seen an uptick in threat reporting prior to the Olympics, which is, of course, of concern, although it is also not unusual for a major international event. And we have offered, as I said, assistance to the Russians -- any assistance that they might need to counter that threat.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Russia accepting any of that assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s been offered?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would, first of all, refer you to the Department of Defense for details on assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s been offered.\xc2\xa0 I would also say that we\xe2\x80\x99re having ongoing conversations with the Russians about this and have offered any assistance that we can provide.\xc2\xa0 They obviously have lead for security at the Olympics -- they are the host nation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did that offer come out of a concern that they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing enough?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that this is an international event; there will be a large U.S. citizen presence there for an extended period of time, and we take the necessary precautions as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 I think the Pentagon said on Monday of this week that the United States has offered its full support to the Russian government, and that includes the two U.S. ships that have been sent to the Black Sea as part of the prudent planning and preparations that are required for an event like this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And then one other issue -- The Washington Post today had a story quoting U.S. officials expressing concern that they would not be able to make good on the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise regarding the telephone records and the NSA proposals.\xc2\xa0 How confident is the White House that a deadline can be met?\xc2\xa0 Was it realistic?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say the relevant agencies are already at work on implementing the directions in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech that he gave.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, these are complicated issues, but they are not new to us.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already been working on them over the past six months and doing everything in our power, already we are, to meet those timelines. So it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated, but the word has already gone out, some of the work has already been done, and the President looks forward to progress being made and completed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Russia, the call with Putin, who called who?\xc2\xa0 Did the President call or did Putin?\xc2\xa0 Who initiated the call?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that, Jon.\xc2\xa0 They speak with some frequency, but I can find out if there is an initiator.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And get back to us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on this question of security at the Olympics, what is your assessment, what is the White House assessment?\xc2\xa0 How are the Russians doing on security?\xc2\xa0 Are they doing enough?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what I can tell you is there has been an uptick in some of the reporting, but that is not unusual. It\xe2\x80\x99s of concern, but not unusual for an event like this.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has handled and is handling the issue of travel advisories for U.S. citizens, and we are offering the Russians any assistance that they might require or request in a situation like this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be qualified -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to venture to assess overall except that these kinds of major events around the world obviously present security challenges; this one is not unique.\xc2\xa0 And we take matters like this seriously because of the presence of U.S. citizens.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re offering the assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99re offering, as well as encouraging U.S. citizens planning to travel to Sochi to be in contact with the State Department to make sure they\'re aware of the advisories that are out there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you characterize our level of confidence in the steps they have taken?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard -- obviously Putin has talked a \xe2\x80\x9cring of steel\xe2\x80\x9d around the Sochi Olympics.\xc2\xa0 Do we have a great deal of confidence that they have done enough on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you, Jon, is that we have had conversations with the Russian government about security in Sochi.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with President Putin about this.\xc2\xa0 We have offered any assistance that they might want to avail themselves of, and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking, I think, prudent precautions on this matter, as evidenced by some of the steps the Department of Defense and the State Department have taken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to assess from here because this is a complicated piece of business, obviously -- an international event like this, Olympics in general -- because they, unlike already complicated events like a single day of a sporting event, the Olympics last over a significant period of time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask a question on the Iran -- on the negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue?\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s belief that if you can reach an agreement with the Iranians that those sanctions can be lifted without congressional approval?\xc2\xa0 Can further sanctions be lifted?\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are some steps which you\xe2\x80\x99re able to do without congressional approval, but can you strike a deal with Iran and lift sanctions without Congress okaying it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that assessment made because it presupposes what is the only acceptable outcome to these negotiations, which is a verifiable, transparent agreement by Iran to forsake its nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0 And the promise of that for Iran is that by coming into compliance with its international obligation, by offering in a way that is 100 percent reassuring to the P5-plus-1 and our international partners and allies that they will not pursue and cannot pursue a nuclear weapon, there will be an opportunity for Iran to end its isolated state that its violation of its international obligations has brought upon it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut how that process would work, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little early to discuss that because the six-month period that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about for the negotiations over a comprehensive solution is only just beginning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then just one last thing.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady had her 50th birthday party and I believe you said that the President picks up the cost for that party.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we put out information.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it here.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the East Wing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I was just wondering if you had an estimate on what the cost was.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but I would refer you to the East Wing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that uptick in threat reporting, you said that it\xe2\x80\x99s something you should expect with events like this.\xc2\xa0 But really going beyond that, part of that uptick is because of recent events in the area because of the region we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to assess the region.\xc2\xa0 I think that international events like this always represent -- or present, rather, security challenges, and that\xe2\x80\x99s broadly speaking.\xc2\xa0 Obviously each event presents unique challenges.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a detailed analysis of how this one might be different from another one.\xc2\xa0 The approach that the U.S. government takes and the administration takes is one of prudent preparation because of any risks that might be out there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as I said, as you might expect in the run-up to an event like this, there has been an uptick in some of the threat reporting, and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking precautions accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But that is not unusual.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does President Putin seem welcoming of U.S. offers for assistance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we have communicated at a variety of levels including between the two Presidents that we are absolutely willing to assist the Russian government where we can, and those conversations are being engaged.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize them -- I can point you to the Defense Department in terms of some of the conversations they\xe2\x80\x99ve had and some of the steps they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with the Russian government and have those conversations moving forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on The New Yorker piece, the President said a couple of things about marijuana.\xc2\xa0 He said that legalization experiments in Washington State and Colorado should \xe2\x80\x9cgo forward.\xe2\x80\x9d He also mentioned that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think marijuana was any more dangerous than alcohol.\xc2\xa0 In 2010, this White House put out a policy paper on national drug policy stating that marijuana should not be legalized.\xc2\xa0 Was the President setting new drug policy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on these matters hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 I think he was making a couple of points -- one, that we ought to use discretion appropriately in our prosecution prioritization -- A.\xc2\xa0 B, when it comes to marijuana use, he made clear that he sees it as a bad habit and a vice and not something that he would encourage -- and this is a quote:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not something I encourage, and I told my daughters I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea, a waste of time, not very healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99ve applied our drug laws in a way that has been counterproductive and that there are issues there that need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to -- because he\xe2\x80\x99s quoted quite extensively in that article -- to look at the full context of some of these quotes that have been taken out in phrases when, at least in this instance, there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to see him speak at length.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he does want to see those experiments to go forward in Washington State and Colorado.\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to find out --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the point he was -- well, see, I think again that you\xe2\x80\x99re probably not aware of the entire sentence.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for the experiment\xe2\x80\x9d -- which is bracketed -- \xe2\x80\x9cto go forward because it\xe2\x80\x99s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law, and only a select few get punished.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In other words, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the issue of the disparities in our prosecution of our drug laws that an experiment like this may be addressing.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not endorsing any specific move by a state; he\xe2\x80\x99s simply making an observation.\xc2\xa0 His position on these matters has not changed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, on Syria, getting back to Syria, there has been a huge cache of photos that have been released showing what appears to be widespread killings, mass killings, mass torture in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House examined these photos?\xc2\xa0 Does it have an opinion on what should happen with respect to those photos?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We stand with the rest of the world in horror at these images that have come to light, and we condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of the Assad regime and call on it to adhere to international obligations with respect to the treatment of prisoners.\xc2\xa0 While we cannot independently confirm or affirm the information that was presented recently, these photos cannot be ignored or dismissed.\xc2\xa0 They suggest widespread and apparently systematic violations of international human law and demonstrate just how far the regime is willing to go in harming its own people.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re very disturbing images.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Christie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Back on the metadata program.\xc2\xa0 Can you say when the DOJ and the ODNI began working on the storage -- the new storage place for this database?\xc2\xa0 Was it 10 minutes after the President speech or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when they --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, your answer to Jeff made it sound like --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that on -- the examination of these issues was part of the review process.\xc2\xa0 So moving forward, participants in that effort are not starting from scratch.\xc2\xa0 And that was the point I\xe2\x80\x99m making -- not that the President had issued specifically this directive prior to his speech, but that there\xe2\x80\x99s a knowledge base there that was built in part by the review the President asked for and got, and that will certainly be of assistance as the work moves forward to make some determinations about storage.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know if the Attorney General has assured the President that he can make the deadline that he has set?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I would point you to what I said earlier.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done on this issue broadly speaking so people aren\xe2\x80\x99t starting from scratch.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated piece of business, but the President expects that action can be taken in the timeline he set.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you also have the component of needing congressional help on this.\xc2\xa0 What would happen if Congress did not act to set something up by the deadline the President is talking about?\xc2\xa0 Is the President willing to stop -- he said in his speech that the government will no longer maintain this database.\xc2\xa0 Would he stop doing that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress because we think that this is the kind of thing that can enjoy bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a shared interest in moving forward on this so I think that we hope and expect congressional cooperation moving forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On income inequality, the President has repeatedly made it clear recently that this is going to be a big part of the next three years.\xc2\xa0 But with so little appetite in Congress to do anything about it, how much effort is he going to put behind measures that can actually reduce the trend?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question, as you heard the President say in Anacostia late last year, and as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say over the years, including in Osawatomie and earlier this year, that the challenge we face when it comes to economic mobility in this country and the ability of Americans from all stations in life to achieve the American Dream is something he considers his number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 And addressing that challenge, addressing that problem, making sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity for everyone, is something that we can do together with Congress and it\xe2\x80\x99s also something that he can tackle using all of the tools in his toolbox as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd you have seen him do that -- or rather you have seen examples of how he can do that just recently with the Promise Zones that he talked about, and the manufacturing hub in North Carolina, where we can continue to work on the renaissance of manufacturing in this country and focus on advanced manufacturing and the kind of industries that create well-paying jobs for middle-class families to live on here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve seen it in the initiative last week with a hundred representatives from colleges and universities and elsewhere interested in improving education for Americans, and that, in turn, helps address the issue, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that a single piece of legislation will resolve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\'ve seen it in efforts across the states to raise the minimum wage, state by state.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly supports action by Congress, strongly supports action here in Washington to raise the minimum wage, because as a basic principle in this country you ought to be able to earn a living, i.e. not live in poverty, if you put in a hard day\'s work.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly the President\'s view.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that has enjoyed across the country and through the years bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s an opportunity for action with Congress on that specific issue -- and others.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President is fiercely committed to this agenda that goes right at the heart of what he believes America has always been about, which is the foundational belief that no matter what the circumstances of your birth that you have endless opportunity in this country to advance yourself and your family if you\'re willing to work hard, if you\'re willing to take responsibility, and if you\'re willing to educate yourself and help your family move forward.\xc2\xa0 So this is obviously something the President has spoken about before.\xc2\xa0 I think you can expect that it will be something he\'ll speak about in the coming days and weeks, and throughout his presidency.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would he measure success?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he would measure success by evidence that we have improved economic opportunity in this country for everyone; that the mobility that we\'ve seen declining in this country is on the rise again, where you don\'t have I think surprising statistics that suggest that countries in Europe have greater economic mobility than the United States, which sort of goes at the heart of who we believe we are in this country and what our history has been about when it comes to opportunity for people who have been willing to work hard and take responsibility.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s an agenda that could not have more presidential force behind it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a report last night that the Pentagon sent to the President a report or a recommendation that there would be 10,000 U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan after 2014 provided the BSA is signed, but that those forces would be removed by 2016.\xc2\xa0 A, can you confirm if that\'s true?\xc2\xa0 And if so, does it reflect a presidential desire to wind down the war completely by the end of his term, even if the bilateral security agreement is signed by the Afghan government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, Major, is that the President has not made any decisions about final troop numbers\xc2\xa0 and I\'m not going to discuss ongoing deliberations.\xc2\xa0 We will be weighing inputs from our military commanders, as well as the intelligence community, our diplomats and development experts as we make decisions about our post-2014 presence in Afghanistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you mentioned, in addition, our position continues to be that if we cannot conclude a bilateral security agreement promptly then we will initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the future we\'re seeking; it\xe2\x80\x99s not the policy we think is best, and we don\'t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.\xc2\xa0 But the further this slips into 2014, the more likely such an outcome is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMeanwhile, as the interagency convenes to continue considering options to present to the President for a post-2014 presence, we will have to increasingly take into account the lack of a signed BSA in that planning.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have to frame decisions based on our clear position that we can\'t pursue a post-2014 mission without a BSA.\xc2\xa0 And that mission, if I could just reiterate, would be one tailored to focus on counterterrorism operations and on the training and support of Afghan security forces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo no decisions have been made.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to get into ongoing deliberations.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note in the context of all of these discussions that we are still waiting for the Afghan government to sign the bilateral security agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the difficulty in obtaining that signature on the BSA inject into these deliberations a new question about the utility of keeping forces for a long period after 2014 because it appears the Afghan -- we may not be welcome there and therefore the utility of us staying might be in question now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, in fact, the loya jirga strongly endorsed the bilateral security agreement, and as a body that represents the will and opinion of the Afghan people, we think that is significant and it reflects the fact that the BSA was negotiated in good faith with the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 And we consider that another strong reason why it ought to be signed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know as well as I do that part of this is the succession of Karzai and this being a live issue, so that if it\xe2\x80\x99s not overshadowed, certainly presents itself within the succession of the Karzai government and it certainly is a factor being weighed by not just the loya jirga but whoever may succeed Karzai.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s probably the case, but we\'re not basing the need for the BSA to be signed on that timeline in Afghan politics.\xc2\xa0 We\'re basing it on the fact that we have to make decisions -- we and our NATO allies have to make decisions and make plans for 2014 that need to take into account whether or not there is a BSA that\'s been signed, because there cannot be a further troop presence beyond 2014 absent a signed BSA.\xc2\xa0 So the further we slip into this year, the more we have to take that into account as we make plans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was suggested on a couple of Sunday talk shows that there is evidence in possession of the U.S. government that Edward Snowden may well have received assistance from the Russian government in transit on his way to Russia and that he may be cooperating in ways that is harmful to the U.S. government on an ongoing basis.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration agree with those assessments?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that this is an ongoing criminal investigation; there have been charges brought.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have anything to add from here on that matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the administration cast any doubts on those suspicions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\'t have anything to add.\xc2\xa0 There is a case that has been presented against Mr. Snowden, charges have been brought.\xc2\xa0 It is our firm position that he ought to return to the United States and face the charges against him here where he will be afforded all of the protections of due process that our judicial system provides.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In The New Yorker piece, the President said he was haunted by Syria.\xc2\xa0 You read a statement about the images that the administration had a chance to look at.\xc2\xa0 You also said there\xe2\x80\x99s no alternative to Assad staying in power.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\'t there any alternative to Assad staying in power?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been there for almost two and a half years, a wide-running bloody civil war.\xc2\xa0 The military does not appear to be any less aggressive in its defense of the Assad regime than it has been from the start.\xc2\xa0 The opposition is splintered.\xc2\xa0 The Geneva II peace process or conversations are off to, at best, a rocky start.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\'t it possible that Assad stays and the President remains haunted by this for the remainder of his administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s no future that the Syrian people will endorse for their country that includes Assad in the government or as President.\xc2\xa0 He has forsaken in bloody fashion any claim he might have to lead that country into the future by massacring his own people --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But with respect, that may undermine his moral authority, but the practical reality is he\xe2\x80\x99s there, his military is there and fights aggressively to keep him there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing civil war there, and there is no solution, there is no end to that war absent a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0 And that settlement has to be based on the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9, which calls for a transitional governing authority based on mutual consent.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no achieving mutual consent in Syria of the members of that governing authority that could include Bashar al-Assad in the government.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 It can\'t happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our view that Assad can\'t be part of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future is not one that we make on our own; it\xe2\x80\x99s one we observe in the fulfillment of the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9, because there\xe2\x80\x99s no way the opposition would agree to -- nor should -- a governing transitional authority that would include Assad among those participants.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on that point, is a U.S. military strike against Syria -- a potential U.S. military strike still on the table?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I don\'t think that we would ever rule out options when dealing with matters like this.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that we foresee no U.S. troops in Syria and that there is -- the only resolution here -- I think that suggesting the use of force somehow answers the mail when we said there\xe2\x80\x99s no resolution here that doesn\'t include a negotiated political settlement --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President very publicly considered U.S. force, was right up to the line of it, and then went to Congress.\xc2\xa0 All that only played out a few months ago.\xc2\xa0 My question is two summers ago, the President from that podium had a news conference and drew the red line and that was on chemical weapons specifically.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As was the threat of the use of force.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The threat of force.\xc2\xa0 And the President, though, then when he drew that red line in August of 2012, said that if they crossed the line there would be enormous consequences.\xc2\xa0 Now, in addition to the mass killings that were just talked about a moment ago, chemical weapons were used in mass fashion, and as result, in a positive step, Syria started turning over some of those chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 But my question is, Assad is still in power, as Major suggested.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s still killing his own people. What is -- what can the U.S. do about it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, if I could briefly clarify the history that you recounted, the President made clear that it was a red line for Syria to use chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And he then very clearly and forcefully threatened force when the evidence demonstrated that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 It was because of that credible use of force -- threat of force, rather, that something happened that I don\'t think anybody would have predicted, which is that a government that had long denied that it even possessed chemical weapons agreed to give them all up.\xc2\xa0 And that process is underway.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat remains the case is that there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing civil war. What the President has said is that we will do everything we can through provision of humanitarian assistance, through pushing the Geneva process forward, including the meetings underway now, including help and assistance to the opposition, to help bring about an end to the war and a negotiated political --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But all of that has been going on for a couple of years now is my question, I guess.\xc2\xa0 And if the President is haunted by it, does he feel paralyzed?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess, Ed, I would point you to the words of the President when he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that we cannot intervene in every -- militarily into every civil war, but we can do what we have done in this case, which is work with international partners to help try to bring about a negotiated political settlement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we can, as we did, working with our international partners, help bring about the commitment by Syria to give up one of the largest collections of chemical weapons in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that is obviously something that\xe2\x80\x99s very positive and that work is ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing on health care.\xc2\xa0 The Hill newspaper reported a couple of days ago that a procurement document from late December says that federal officials decided to bring on Accenture for the healthcare.gov contract.\xc2\xa0 And they did it quickly; they did it without open bid because they justified it, administration officials, by saying they had to move quickly because they said the health insurance industry was at risk if the site was not fixed.\xc2\xa0 They also went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9dThe entire health care reform program is jeopardized if these fixes are not made by mid-March.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Who said that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Federal officials who were quoted in --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which officials?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From CMS, I would expect.\xc2\xa0 Not from the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the article.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of those statements --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying the website is turning the corner.\xc2\xa0 Does this document suggest that there are still concerns here in the administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the document.\xc2\xa0 What I can you tell you is there has been an enormous effort expended and an enormous effort that continues to be expended in making sure that the website functions effectively for the millions of Americans who have so clearly demonstrated that they desire the product on offer here.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly hope that as those improvements have resulted in significantly increased numbers of Americans enrolling in and purchasing insurance through the exchanges, that that story is getting the full coverage that it merits.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to Sochi for a second.\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, there were some reports beginning yesterday that the U.S. was using counterterrorism operatives to help the Russians look for potential suicide bombers inside the security zone.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 And even if you can\xe2\x80\x99t, is the U.S. concerned that there may be suicide bombers inside the security zone?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have more.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I have not seen that report.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we are having conversations with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that we are prepared to provide any assistance that we can if Russia asks for it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with them and take steps as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking out of prudence, given that this is the kind of event where security is an issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s call with Mr. Putin, the one thing in the readout that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice was any mention of Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us explicitly, did they -- is this like in the agree-to-disagree category and they just don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it? Or they talked about it and it\xe2\x80\x99s just not going in the readout because there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you could possibly tell us about what they said?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more detail on the phone call.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that our position on Mr. Snowden I think is abundantly clear to everyone, including the Russians, and our view that he ought to be returned to the United States where he will be afforded all the rights and protections in our system.\xc2\xa0 That hasn\'t changed.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think there\'s any doubt in Moscow or elsewhere of our position on that matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I do one more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s an ally of Angela Merkel\'s who is like the foreign policy spokesman for her party in the Parliament, and what he had said is that it\'s their view that what the President has promised or offered in terms of the foreign leader aspect of the NSA role last week isn\'t quite enough and that -- he said, "Transatlantic relations are in the deepest crisis now since the Iraq war."\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if the President is concerned about the sort of ongoing steps to repair the relationship with Germany specifically and what he is doing in the wake of the NSA remarks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have had direct country-to-country and, in some cases, leader-to-leader consultations on these matters as they have arisen.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve certainly been clear about that when it comes to the United States and Germany and President Obama and Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that at Chancellor Merkel and President Obama\'s direction, we have undertaken extensive, close consultations on our intelligence cooperation in recent months, which has resulted -- those consultations, rather, have resulted in a better understanding of the requirements and concerns that exist on both sides.\xc2\xa0 And those consultations will continue among our intelligence services.\xc2\xa0 And I think they reflect the very close relationship we have across the board, including on issues of and matters of intelligence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, clearly, there was a greater degree of sharing in past Olympics -- in London, in Vancouver, and even Beijing before that.\xc2\xa0 What specifically would you like to see with Russia that would give this administration more confidence in the safety of Americans not just in Sochi, but throughout Russia?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Peter, I just don\'t have more on this beyond what I\'ve said, which is that we are in conversations with the Russians, we\'ve made clear that we are prepared to offer any assistance that they might require.\xc2\xa0 Russian authorities are, of course, responsible for overall security at the Olympics -- they are the host nation -- and the State Department\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security has the security lead for the United States. As part of that responsibility, we will send diplomatic security and FBI agents to liaise with host nation security and law enforcement officials.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that reflects the actions that we take in situations like this; they\'re fairly standard.\xc2\xa0 But these are obviously events that present security challenges, so we work with host nations and we take actions that we think are necessary to make sure that the precautions we can take are taken.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this time, is the White House satisfied that Russia is prepared to host a safe games?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that Russia has responsibility for overall security in terms of the steps that they\'ve taken, and assurances that they can make are ones that they have to make.\xc2\xa0 Our view is that we partner with host nations and liaise with them.\xc2\xa0 We also, in this case, are offering security assistance and we\'ll continue to work with the Russians as the event approaches and begins.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Angus King said a couple of days ago, "I would not go and I don\'t think I\'d send my family."\xc2\xa0 Americans are making those decisions right now.\xc2\xa0 Should Americans go?\xc2\xa0 Should they feel safe sending their family?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think there will be, as I understand it, a lot of Americans in Sochi, which is why, of course, we pay close attention to an event like this.\xc2\xa0 There will be Team USA members there, as well as corporate sponsors.\xc2\xa0 And our advice to Americans who might travel to the games is to avail themselves of the information provided by the State Department in the form of travel advisories related to this and to take the standard precautions that those advisories recommend.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, we\'re just going to continue to work with -- to take the necessary precautions and to work with the Russian government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for Chairman Rogers, who this weekend discussed his suspicion or belief that Edward Snowden received some help -- this is going to a question that was asked earlier -- but he made these -- you could call them allegations or accusations -- at least it was his belief system that there was help provided to Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 A senior FBI official told us on Sunday that it\xe2\x80\x99s still the Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Mr. Snowden acted alone. So I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m curious right now if Chairman Rogers and others using language like that somehow hinders the relationship the U.S. is trying to develop right now with Russia by making those suggestions when it appears the administration has no evidence of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the disagreement we have with Russia over Edward Snowden I think has been publicly expressed with some frequency.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he helping or hurting by saying that if there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\xe2\x80\x99s really an issue because we have -- the President spoke with President Putin directly and does so with some frequency, as Presidents of Russia and the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, about -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, about Edward Snowden?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying in general that we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that the President can talk to President Putin, and does.\xc2\xa0 And in our relations with Russia, we have areas of significant cooperation where our interests are aligned and we have areas of significant disagreement, including but not limited to the matter of Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re anything but transparent about that.\xc2\xa0 And we have expressed that very clearly both on that matter and other matters.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been the approach the President has taken in our relations with Russia because he thinks that best serves the interests of the United States, which is a very clear-eyed approach to U.S.-Russian relations that allows for cooperation on matters that are vital to U.S. national security and U.S. interests, and can also allow for the clear expression of disagreements -- and that happens.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are still able to move forward and cooperate with the Russians on a host of areas.\xc2\xa0 That includes the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 It includes counterterrorism cooperation in general.\xc2\xa0 And it includes obviously the ability to discuss security around the Sochi games.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, very quickly, we\xe2\x80\x99re under the impression you\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to us on who delivered -- who placed the phone call, whether it was President Putin or President Obama yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re under the -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that the conversation was apparently several days or even weeks in the making.\xc2\xa0 Did the two of them agree to have other conversations and have other conversations been set before the games where further decisions will be made in terms of cooperation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any previews of additional phone calls that may or may not happen.\xc2\xa0 As I said, the President speaks with President Putin with some frequency, as you might expect, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when the next call might be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Jess.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the U.S.-Africa summit that you announced earlier this week, can you talk about what prompted that, and also why Egypt is not among those that are invited, especially given what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that what prompted it is the hope that the summit will build on the progress made since the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Africa last summer that it will advance the administration\xe2\x80\x99s focus on trade and investment in Africa and highlight America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Africa\xe2\x80\x99s security, its democratic development and its people.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that on matters of the invitation list, on Egypt -- I know I have this here somewhere.\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 I can give you -- Egypt has not been invited because it is suspended from the African Union, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why Egypt was not invited.\xc2\xa0 I can read you the entire list of the invitees, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen it.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s why Egypt was not invited.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that that is a missed opportunity to have discussions that you\xe2\x80\x99d like to be having with Egypt?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we have regular discussions with Egyptian leaders and authorities focused on the bilateral relationship, on security matters, but also on developments in Egypt and our belief that Egypt needs to transition to a civilian-led government in a process that is inclusive where Egyptians from all walks of life get to express their views and be heard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tReid.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, yesterday after he was indicted, former Virginia Governor McDonnell and his attorneys both described his actions while he was governor as similar to things that President Obama has done in the White House.\xc2\xa0 They said in the legal brief the President routinely participates in corporate events which lend credibility to his major benefactors, invites benefactors to events in the White House, allows his photo to be taken with benefactors, and includes benefactors in policy discussions with senior administration officials, in describing or explaining Governor McDonnell\xe2\x80\x99s actions with Jonnnie Williams.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\'re going to refer questions about the prosecution to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 But does the President sort of concede the point that a lot of the people who are involved in some of these policy discussions are people who have contributed to his campaign?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Reid, I have no comment on what is obviously an ongoing matter of prosecution, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how will foreign leaders know if they are among the friends and allies whose phone calls the United States will not conduct surveillance on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, what I would say is that we have direct conversations through diplomatic channels on these issues and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 I think you can address those questions, that question elsewhere, but I think that we -- as has been the case since these revelations began, where they have affected our relations with a specific country, there have been direct and substantive conversations between the two countries using diplomatic channels, which is the tradition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them, you\xe2\x80\x99re okay, your phone calls won\xe2\x80\x99t be surveilled?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what other method you might suggest, Mark.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I can simply tell you that we have close relationships with our friends and allies -- our close friends and allies, and these kinds of discussions take place through normal diplomatic channels.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And have you responded to the ad yesterday in the paper from Europe 1 Radio requesting an interview with the President?\xc2\xa0 And would you suggest that\'s a way for many of us to request interviews from now on?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think CBS has requested interviews through more traditional means successfully, as have many of the news organizations here.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that as a means to request.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an expensive way to do it.\xc2\xa0 But keep those invitations coming.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:48 P.M.
