Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:09 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to let you know that we have a special guest today, and she is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my paper -- but it is Betsey Stevenson, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we have today -- the President has later this afternoon a meeting with members of Congress who focus on issues of women and the economy, and the need to expand opportunity for all Americans by a variety of methods, including raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 As you know, women are disproportionately affected by that policy.</p>\n<p>We have also announced a summit that Betsey can talk about for later in the spring.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is have her talk to you about some of the issues that are going to be discussed today and later in the spring, and then for you to address questions on those subject areas to her; she can answer them.\xc2\xa0 Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let her get back to work and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take questions on other subjects.</p>\n<p>With that, I give you Betsey Stevenson.</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So today, the President is announcing the date of the Working Families Summit -- June 23rd.\xc2\xa0 And this Working Families Summit is designed so that between now and June 23rd we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be convening business leaders, educators, researchers, advocates, Congress members, state and local government -- everyone who wants to participate -- to talk about how we can make sure the economy is working as well as it can for American families.\xc2\xa0 And doing this is important, and we are doing this to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re making the best use of American talent to ensure competitiveness in the U.S. economy as we are going deeper into the 21st century.</p>\n<p>So what I am here to do today is to talk to you about where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress with women in the labor force, where we need to do more, and to emphasize why it\xe2\x80\x99s important.</p>\n<p>So you\xe2\x80\x99ve all been I think given a set of these slides that are going to show up behind me -- so we can switch to the next slide.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to show you graphs -- I\xe2\x80\x99m the nerdy economist here -- just to present data after data after data.</p>\n<p>So the first thing is to point out that women are now nearly half of our labor force, and their labor force participation rose sharply in the 1970s and 1980s.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, many of you heard I\xe2\x80\x99m sure plenty of times before, is that that participation rate stalled out as we got to the late \xe2\x80\x9890s.\xc2\xa0 And you can see it here divided by ages, that for prime age working women 25-54 we saw sort of a flattening of labor force participation at around 75 percent in the late \xe2\x80\x9890s.</p>\n<p>Now, some of you may notice that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a pretty big decline among 16- to 24-year-old women.\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed -- this is because these women are investing in education like never before.\xc2\xa0 In fact, these women have not only caught up with their male contemporaries, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve surpassed them.\xc2\xa0 And in the next slide you can see how much women\xe2\x80\x99s educational attainment, college graduate rates have risen -- both, as I said, catching up with men and surpassing them -- so that young women today, those 25-34, are about a little more than 20 percent more likely than young men to actually hold a college degree.</p>\n<p>They\xe2\x80\x99ve also gone on to graduate school, which you can see on the next slide, and basically are attending graduate school at nearly equal rates with men these days.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0What this illustrates is how important women are for our economy as young women today represent the majority of our young highly skilled talent.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve also -- as the next slide will show -- are increasingly going into male occupations.\xc2\xa0 So this highlights just how important they are for our labor force, for our economy in terms of utilizing that talent.</p>\n<p>What they\xe2\x80\x99re also important for is their families.\xc2\xa0 Women\xe2\x80\x99s earnings have continued to grow as a share of family earnings.\xc2\xa0 And on the next slide you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that, today, employed, married women contribute nearly 45 percent of the earnings in their household.\xc2\xa0 Now, of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s still 45 percent, and that partially reflects that fact that we know that there is still a gender wage gap, and that gender wage gap is seen very persistently across the income distribution.\xc2\xa0 We see it within occupations and we see it across occupations, and we even see it when women and men are working side by side doing identical work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to take a look at some of the contributors to that gender wage gap.\xc2\xa0 And on the next slide what I want to show you is the fact that when you look at men and women with professional degrees, in their twenties these young people are earning roughly similar wages.\xc2\xa0 But what happens is men get the greater share of the promotions, of the raises, and by the time we get to the late thirties, early forties, women are quite behind their male colleagues, even when we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a rarefied group -- those with professional degrees.</p>\n<p>Now, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only aspect, obviously, of gender wage gap.\xc2\xa0 And the next thing I want to talk about is sort of the other end of the income distribution.\xc2\xa0 So if you change to the next slide, please.\xc2\xa0 Here you can take a look at what is happening with minimum wage workers.\xc2\xa0 Even though raising the minimum wage would benefit all minimum wage workers\xc2\xa0 -- both men and women -- because women are more likely to be working at the minimum wage, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would contribute to shrinking the gender wage gap.\xc2\xa0 And our estimates are that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would shrink the gender wage gap by about 5 percent.</p>\n<p>So, finally, let me conclude with the last slide, which I think really highlights that there is more to do to encourage women to participate in the labor force, to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to make the most of their talent and that our labor force is able to get the most out of their talent.\xc2\xa0 And what you can see is that while the U.S. has seen female labor force participation stall, other countries have continued to make progress in bringing women\xe2\x80\x99s labor force participation up to equality with men\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s much for us to learn and do.\xc2\xa0 And the events and work leading us to the summit will hopefully inform the key policy goals and best practices that we can use to make greater progress on this really important issue.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on folks.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Betsey, you mentioned that professional women not getting promotions, for example, are getting similar wages early on and then there\xe2\x80\x99s that disparity.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how much of a gap, the gap in wages, in general, is a result of unequal pay for -- or unequal pay for equal work and how much of it is just a denial of opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Have you been able to measure that?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you a metric on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that the right way to think about it is there are lots of things that contribute to the gender wage gap, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend all our time trying to parse it and figure out how much each aspect is contributing to it, but actually look at where we have the greatest leverage to effect change.\xc2\xa0 So making sure that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the opportunities employers are extending, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s even the choices that women feel that they need to make given the needs of their family, that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to make sure that we release constraints wherever we can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in terms of the federal government and as a policymaker, where does that leverage exist for you guys?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be exploring.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are steps that we can take to promote equal pay.\xc2\xa0 There are steps we can promote to -- we can take to support paid leave efforts.\xc2\xa0 But I think the important thing to recognize is that this administration, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think this is something that government can do on its own.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we need to be bringing everyone together so that businesses understand the importance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re moving into a labor force where, as I said at the beginning, the skilled labor is increasingly female skilled labor, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not actually doing the best we can to maximize GDP growth if we\xe2\x80\x99re not letting women reach the fullest of their potential.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s really an issue that we think businesses are going to have to take a lead on, state and local governments are going to have to take a lead on.\xc2\xa0 And then there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously places for the federal government to play a role in, and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be sorting out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask you a little bit about the overtime proposal that the President is going to talk about tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, you\xe2\x80\x99re not setting a threshold number, I take it, that would increase salary for when overtime would be considered, the current number being I think for $455 a week.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not proposing a specific number?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we know right now is the threshold has been eroded by inflation.\xc2\xa0 And there are 3.1 million people who, if the threshold had kept up just with inflation, would automatically be covered by overtime provisions.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing is in the weeks and months to come looking deeply at this problem and making sure that the overtime provisions are working as well as they should in today\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure what that\xe2\x80\x99s going to lead us to.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do the work.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to dig into it and make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting feedback from all key stakeholders and figuring out what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the best way to modernize this rule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you want it pegged -- one of the things would be having to peg for inflation?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be looking at all possible angles and trying to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s the best possible way to make this rule work for the current economy.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the labor participation rate, on one chart you had Canada, Germany and Sweden quite a bit higher.\xc2\xa0 Do we have a theory as to why those countries have a higher labor participation rate for women?\xc2\xa0 And is there an ideal rate?\xc2\xa0 Is there a target that you want to hit?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 What I want is for everyone to feel that they can participate to their fullest extent to make the most of their talent and to not feel artificially constrained.\xc2\xa0 What research shows us is that countries that provide more support to working families, more flexible work arrangements, greater access to paid leave, greater access to child care, greater access to early childhood education -- all of those things actually do facilitate women participating to a greater extent in the labor force.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have estimates on if you were to -- so, inflation adjust overtime, for example, how that would affect women in the workplace?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 You mean, if we were --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would that move address this other issue that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising, combining the two?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 That is a great question, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something, again, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be looking into as we study this problem, is that who is most affected by the fact that the thresholds have been eroded by inflation and by the fact that the way that duties test currently work.\xc2\xa0 So we are going to be studying this problem from a bunch of different angles.\xc2\xa0 But right now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to modernize the rule, but not how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it or who would be impacted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to say that the administration is inclined at least to get it up to its inflation-adjusted value?\xc2\xa0 Other states have gone higher than that.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, some economists that used to work in this building have publicly recommended even a higher threshold than that.\xc2\xa0 If you go back to 1975, that inflation adjustment would take it almost to $1,000.\xc2\xa0 I mean, can you give us some idea what kind of range you\xe2\x80\x99re in and if at least the inflation adjustment would be the beginning point of debate?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that this President believes in a labor market that\xe2\x80\x99s fair for people, and that when you work hard that you\xe2\x80\x99re rewarded with fair pay.\xc2\xa0 And what we know is that without overtime and minimum wage protections, there are many people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get that basic promise, which is that when you work hard, you get a fair wage.\xc2\xa0 And what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do is make sure that we modernize this rule so that people are able to get treated fairly in the labor force and that they\xe2\x80\x99re rewarded for a hard day\xe2\x80\x99s work with fair pay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the education attainment graph that you were just showing, do you have the stats?\xc2\xa0 Is this like -- because this has been a gap for a while -- women college graduates ahead of male college graduates in general.\xc2\xa0 Has it moved the needle on this?\xc2\xa0 Has it gotten better?\xc2\xa0 Do you have the stats?\xc2\xa0 And is this something that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear in 10 years that that\xe2\x80\x99s because of the -- that it will go away?\xc2\xa0 Is it moving that way?\xc2\xa0 Could you make that argument?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 So those are great questions.\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice that married women\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to household earnings has continued to rise -- employed married women\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to household earnings has continued to rise even though labor force participation itself has stalled out.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?\xc2\xa0 Well, because women are increasingly -- they\xe2\x80\x99re more likely today to be more highly educated than their husbands.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to be the more highly skilled person inside their family.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a role for women getting greater skills, becoming more educated in terms of their contribution to household earnings, and in terms of changing the overall gender-wage gap.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly hope that we continue to encourage men to go to school as well, and to continue to get skills.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it a solution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean, though.\xc2\xa0 But is it -- statistically it\xe2\x80\x99s behind if this were -- if you took out gender as a factor, it\xe2\x80\x99s behind women with the same college education?\xc2\xa0 I guess it goes to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question a little bit.</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xc2\xa0 And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t show this data because it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit more complex, but we can actually follow the same people over time after they\xe2\x80\x99ve graduated from school, and what you see is that same pattern -- that I showed you just by showing you age -- by years out of school.\xc2\xa0 So if I did it by same person, how many years out of graduate school are they, you see the same thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What you see is that women, as they get into that point where there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of family burdens, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got young kids at home, they\xe2\x80\x99re making trade-offs, they\xe2\x80\x99re put in positions that end up resulting in a larger gender-wage gap.\xc2\xa0 And what we want to do is make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done as much as we can, that businesses are doing as much as they can to not lose women at those critical moments when they\xe2\x80\x99re having children, when they have young children at home.\xc2\xa0 And I think that aspect of the gender-wage gap, that you see it expand as women age, is something that\xe2\x80\x99s not going away by increasing college attainment or increasing graduate school.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Betsey, because there might be some people who are listening to the emphasis on women and suggesting, based on our experience coming from past administrations, that this is an election year effort to appeal to a core demographic for candidates -- Democratic candidates this year -- can you describe how the President would respond to that charge, that this is kind of an eleventh-hour to appeal to women as a core demographic group?\xc2\xa0 And also, because the President has always been very results-oriented about talk-a-thons and summits and that, can you describe what kind of deliverables he would hope to get out of that summit in June?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, let me say I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve hopefully made the case to you that this is an important issue for our economy.\xc2\xa0 It is something that is going to continue to grow in importance for our economy in the years to come.\xc2\xa0 And let me just say that I\'ve studied this issue my whole career and the President recruited me to the Council of Economic Advisers, so this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new thing.\xc2\xa0 Certainly people have been thinking about this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is an important issue; it\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And as the labor force has started to recover, it\'s important for us now to think about how to make sure that the labor force is working as well as it can for everyone.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s not a coincidence that you hear the President saying, are our overtime rules protecting American workers and offering them the kind of fairness and protection they need, at the same time that he\xe2\x80\x99s saying is our labor market working for American families the way it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So as a policy person, I can only comment on the policy, but I can tell you that it\'s certainly good policy, it\'s the right policy, and it\'s something we really need to embrace.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the summit?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Oh, so the summit -- the goal is to bring people together and to develop both a set of best practices that we hope will inform how businesses make decisions, sharing examples of things that businesses have learned -- ways in which they can actually make changes that improve the situation for women and working families, but also improve their bottom line.\xc2\xa0 So we want to convene people to make sure that everybody has shared these best practices.\xc2\xa0 We\'re also hoping to get some ideas for what would be ideal policy and what should be the policies that leaders should be pursuing coming forward.</p>\n<p>This is an attempt to bring people together to create and articulate a vision for the changes we need to make to the labor market to support working families better.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether voluntarily or legislative?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roberta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What analysis have you done, if any, on the overtime rule on how it would affect hiring and the number of jobs overall, what interplay that has?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 So obviously that is something that we think a lot about, and there is a lot of research on how it can affect hiring.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re really focused on is the fact that when somebody is -- this is looking at people who are working over 40 hours a week and are they getting paid for that.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that if you\'re making $25,000 a year and you\'re working 60 hours a week, you should be getting paid for the extra hours you work.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what this is about.</p>\n<p>There is research that suggests that you could see employment increase as a result of modernizing the overtime rules, but that certainly wouldn\'t be a primary focus right now. What we\'re trying to take a look at is how we can make the labor force as fair as possible for all workers and that people get rewarded for a hard day\xe2\x80\x99s work with fair wages.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Betsey, if you were to combine those overtime rules being revamped with an increase in the minimum wage, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fairly obvious that there would be a burden on businesses if the administration were to get everything that it wanted with respect to those two items?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 We think these two items are very different, but obviously they do feed into the same thing, which is people should be rewarded for fair work.\xc2\xa0 But again, realize we\'re not talking about people who -- what you\'re paying workers who are working 30 or 40 hours a week.\xc2\xa0 This is, do you have an obligation to pay the minimum wage to someone -- to pay the minimum wage or overtime to someone who is on a fixed salary and maybe working 60, 70, 80 hours a week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that unless you\'re truly in one of these white-collar jobs, that employers should be paying attention to whether they\xe2\x80\x99re actually meeting the duties of paying you the minimum wage and that they should be required to pay you for the hours you work.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a pretty simple idea:\xc2\xa0 Employers should pay people for the hours they work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on the Reuter\xe2\x80\x99s question, it\'s been suggested to me what you could see is that employers will cut off overtime -- they may hire more people, which would be good, but wages overall would stay stagnant or even decline.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried about that as an unintended consequence of this?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will tell you that that was actually an intended consequence of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which set out the 40-hour work week as an ideal.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'re going to be studying this in the weeks and months to come and we\'re going to be looking at all the different ways in which we think employers might respond.\xc2\xa0 This rule is something that definitely needs to be modernized, that we need to ensure that workers have the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Those protections have been eroded over time.\xc2\xa0 This threshold, as was pointed out earlier, in 1975 was nearly $1,000 in today\xe2\x80\x99s dollars; today it\'s $455.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re at a very different place and we are, you might say, in a very different labor market.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re going to be taking a look at the labor market, taking a look at workers, and figuring out how we can make this rule work best for businesses, and to think about how we can simplify it for businesses so that it can work best for businesses and for workers in ensuring that basic principle of fairness.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Betsey, on the equity issue, the President has said many times that his first bill he signed into law was Lilly Ledbetter to make sure that women would be paid fairly.\xc2\xa0 Are there gaps in that law?\xc2\xa0 Are businesses ignoring it?\xc2\xa0 I know there are broader issues you\'re talking about, but on the equity issue, that was signed into law in 2009.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xc2\xa0 Why is there still this inequity?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the challenges is the fact that employers can enforce pay non-disclosure agreements, and as a result, even though the Lilly Ledbetter Act passed, one of her problems was that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much her colleagues made.\xc2\xa0 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that her male colleagues were earning so much more than her.\xc2\xa0 And what we need to make sure is that women do have and are able to actually find out what their male colleagues earn and are able to learn about situations of pay discrimination so that when you\'re someone like Lilly Ledbetter who, working side by side with men, doing the exact same work, you know if you\'re being paid equally or not.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anyone else?\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the minimum wage, if enacted into law, would reduce the gap between men and women by 5 percent.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any data on how much the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive order from last month that would work for federal contractors, starting in 2015, how much of a dent that would make?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve spent a lot of time trying to look at the federal contractors and who would be affected, but I have to tell you we do not have the data to get into the granularity of the gender of the employees of federal contractors earning minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just not a level of granularity we have.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In the back.\xc2\xa0 Fred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would this have a bigger impact on heads of households than -- the overtime rule -- would that have a much bigger impact on heads of household earners than the minimum wage law?</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Again, I know I keep giving the same answer, but we really have to study the effects of the overtime rule to figure out how we would change it; and then how we would change it obviously impacts who would be affected.\xc2\xa0 So I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question unless I were able to know exactly how we were going to change the rule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Disabilities?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering about women -- oftentimes in families where there\xe2\x80\x99s a disabled child, the burden often falls on the woman, and often also there\xe2\x80\x99s higher percentage of divorce in those families.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if there might be some way that we could include some safeguards for those single families where there are some additional challenges.</p>\n<p>MS. STEVENSON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m really glad you mentioned that because the Working Families Summit is definitely going to be focusing on all the different aspects of caregiving that people need to do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been remiss in not mentioning care of aging parents, which is a very important issue and will grow in its importance as the baby boomers continue to age.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo looking at special needs that people have in caregiving roles, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s for dealing with children with disabilities, disabled spouses, returning veterans with disabilities -- I mean, there are a number of these issues -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be making sure that this summit is very inclusive of all of that, and that is why it\xe2\x80\x99s a summit on working families, because we want to understand how to make the labor market work better for all families.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me wrap it up there.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank Betsey for taking -- making the presentation and taking the questions.\xc2\xa0 As someone whose spouse is more highly educated, skilled, and compensated, I can say that -- (laughter) -- and who wrote a book with somebody in this room about the power of women in the marketplace, and the fact that especially at higher income levels and higher attainment levels they contribute directly and positively to the bottom line, what Betsey said about the fact that this is not just a government action but one where we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for partners for best practices in the private sector is very important.</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the CIA, one of the issues that Senator Feinstein raised yesterday was this complaint that the CIA General Counsel took to DOJ regarding -- against SSCI staffers, committee staffers.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, was the White House notified of this action beforehand, or did it learn about it after?\xc2\xa0 Can you fill us in on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The CIA Director and General Counsel informed the White House that they were making a referral to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 They also said they would be informing the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\xc2\xa0 And as you would expect in this matter and as appropriate, we did not weigh in on that, but we were simply given a heads up about the referral.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much into \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe right before, shortly before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shortly before -- like a day?\xc2\xa0 Hours?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific time lapse for you, but it was a heads up, and we were informed -- the Counsel was informed that the committee would also be informed, is my understanding -- because this was an inter-branch of government matter -- as a heads up.\xc2\xa0 But there was no weighing in or comment on it -- simply a heads up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the Counsel then notify the President?\xc2\xa0 Was the President made aware of that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been aware in general about the protocols and the discussions and occasional disputes about the protocols involved in the provision of an unprecedented number of documents from the CIA to the committee -- millions of documents -- which has been a part of the investigation that the President himself, very clearly early on, in May of 2009, endorsed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President\xe2\x80\x99s number one focus in all of this has been to ensure that the committee is able to do its investigation, to complete its investigation, and upon completion of that investigation to submit it for declassification, for the findings to be declassified.\xc2\xa0 And the President urges the committee to finish its work and submit it for declassification.\xc2\xa0 He believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part a process that allows the American people to be informed about what happened, and also for us to bring this chapter to a close.</p>\n<p>So that view is one that he has expressed to the committee and to the agency -- that he believes that we need to see this process come to a conclusion.\xc2\xa0 The committee issued a -- or produced a draft report, I think as has been reported, but it has not yet completed its report.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for its completion; we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the request for declassification.\xc2\xa0 The President wants the findings declassified appropriately, as quickly as possible, and for those findings to be made public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If what the -- if the White House, if the Counsel or other top officials believe that what the CIA Counsel was doing was egregious, would you have attempted to stop the complaint, or would you have weighed in in any fashion at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- this is about a referral by an agency that we would not and did not weigh in on.\xc2\xa0 It was a heads up because of the nature of the inter-branch aspect, and that is my understanding of why the CIA also informed the committee about it.</p>\n<p>But the questions about the matters under review that have to do with process and whether protocols were followed properly, I mean, those are details that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into because they\xe2\x80\x99re under review both by the independent inspector general and by the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So setting aside those matters, the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus and the White House\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on ensuring that the committee is able to complete its work and that it does so expeditiously; that it submits that report for declassification, a request for declassification, which has not been made yet; and that following that, the findings are declassified appropriately.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because as the President has made clear, this is all about activity and so-called enhanced interrogation techniques that the President profoundly disagreed with; made clear that he believed very strongly were not consistent with our values as a nation; promised to end when he was a candidate for President -- and did end, I believe on his second day or second full day in office -- through an executive order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to see the findings of this report declassified appropriately, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, and for everyone\xe2\x80\x99s views about it -- not just the majority\xe2\x80\x99s views, but the minority\xe2\x80\x99s views and the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views -- to be made public in an appropriate manner through declassification, so that the public is aware of the full story and is able to close that chapter, as the President sees it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the White House at no point deemed this complaint, intimidation of committee staff, as \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there was no comment, there was no weighing in, there was no judgment.\xc2\xa0 This was a heads up about a decision made by, as I understand it, the General Counsel of the CIA and the Director, about a referral.\xc2\xa0 And that, as I understand it, was also conveyed to the committee<br/>\n\t.<br/>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the timing of today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that there will be some oil released from reserves, is that just a coincidence that it\xe2\x80\x99s happening today?\xc2\xa0 Or is this an effort to send a signal to Russia that the U.S. is willing to use the reserves to pressure oil prices and put pressure on the ruble?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As the Department of Energy said this morning, they are required by law to conduct continual evaluation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and its system\xe2\x80\x99s drawdown and sales procedures.\xc2\xa0 Due to the recent dramatic increase in domestic crude oil production, significant changes in the system have occurred, including pipeline expansion, construction of new infrastructure, reversed flow of existing pipelines, and increased use of domestic crude oil terminals.\xc2\xa0 So in order to appropriately assess the system\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities in the event of a disruption, today the DOE authorized a test drawdown and sale of up to 5 million barrels of sour crude oil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, they have the details, but in answer specifically to your question, yes, this action was taken consistent with the requirements by law of the DOE to evaluate the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and its drawdown capacity.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a test for operational reasons.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is purely for operational reasons?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But stepping back for a second, is the United States willing to use the SPR more generally as a tool for price modulation to put pressure on oil prices and pressure on the ruble?\xc2\xa0 Some sort of sanction?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to separate the issues here.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about and I don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss potential releases of the SPR.\xc2\xa0 This is a test, so I would refer you to the DOE about this test.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0On the general matter of Ukraine and actions that the United States can take in concert with our European and other partners, we have an executive order in hand, signed by the President, that creates authorities for the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State to take action with regards to sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And that authority is flexible and it is broad, and we are continuing to evaluate the use of that authority via sanctions to hold accountable individuals and entities for the actions that Russia has already taken when it comes to the violations of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, its violations of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And obviously we have that tool available to us as we move forward, and as we assess whether or not Russia will step back from its actions, will return its military personnel to bases in Crimea, whether it will cease the kinds of actions that are a violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and its sovereignty, or whether it will move forward and continue to take these kinds of actions.\xc2\xa0 And we have a tool available to us now, again, working with our European partners and our other partners, in order to sanction individuals and entities as necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So using the SPR is not a tool in your Ukraine toolbox?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not associating the SPR with anything I just said about the general authorities that we have through the executive order signed by the President.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we have the capacity to level sanctions on individuals and entities, and we have authorities and capacities that are broad and flexible to take action accordingly because there have been costs and there will be costs to Russia for its clear violation of international law, for its clear violation of treaties and memoranda that it is party to, for its violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like there\xe2\x80\x99s much you can do to stop this referendum from happening in Crimea on Sunday, but there have been some reports of maybe a potential wrinkle that could maybe perhaps offer an off-ramp in all of this in that the referendum could happen but Russia could say that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to recognize it, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to annex Crimea as a result of that referendum, whatever the Crimeans decide to do.\xc2\xa0 Is that potentially a solution in the mix here?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, any referendum on Crimea and on the status of Crimea and its territory must be conducted consistent with Ukrainian law.\xc2\xa0 And it is our understanding, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, that the Ukrainian constitution requires an all-Ukrainian referendum to alter the territorial boundaries of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And that is obviously what is being contemplated through this action, which is inconsistent with and in violation of the Ukrainian constitution.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So Ukraine, most importantly, would not recognize the legality or legitimacy of this referendum, but neither would the United States nor would the world, save perhaps a few nations.\xc2\xa0 How Russia might view it if it comes to pass is an important question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not legal under the Ukrainian constitution.\xc2\xa0 It is clearly something that if carried out, would be done -- would be carried out in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with the rules laid out under Ukrainian law, and it violates the fundamental principle that, I think in this century and for a long time now, changes to a sovereign nation\xe2\x80\x99s border should not be made by a foreign nation, a foreign government or over the heads of democratically elected officials.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what this would represent.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you think that or does the President think that Vladimir Putin needs a face-saving move here?\xc2\xa0 The steps that you outlined as a part of the potential off-ramp don\xe2\x80\x99t really offer Putin any kind of face-saving, in terms of an end result.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it that way necessarily, but I disagree that the so-called off-ramp on offer here from the international community doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide the leadership of Russia with a means by which to pursue and protect Russia\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interests in Ukraine, and that includes its naval base in Crimea, a naval base established by law in agreement between the Ukrainian and Russian governments, and the protection of the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized that those are real interests.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized that the two countries have deep historical and cultural ties that will not end and should not end.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity here for Russia to maintain the arrangement it has with Ukraine when it comes to its naval base there in keeping with treaties and agreements that it has signed with Ukraine and with the international community, and to ensure through the presence of international monitors and observers that the rights of ethnic Russians are protected.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a substantive off-ramp, if you will, an opportunity provided by the international community to Russia to make sure that its legitimate concerns are addressed without resorting to -- or without seeing Russia resort to a violation of an independent state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And very quickly on Malaysia, does the President feel like Americans are getting enough information about what happened to that aircraft?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Malaysian government of course has the lead in this investigation.\xc2\xa0 U.S. air safety officials are in Kuala Lumpur working closely with the Malaysian government on the investigation.\xc2\xa0 The Malaysian government is investigating a number of possible scenarios for what happened to the flight.\xc2\xa0 Conclusions cannot be drawn at this time, in our view, and we continue to participate actively in the search as well as assist the Malaysian government in the investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can remind you if you need to know of the assets that we\xe2\x80\x99ve sent to the region, including aircraft and helicopters and two destroyers that are a part of the effort of the search underway.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to conclusions from that investigation, it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to draw any, in our view.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Jon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, so Secretary Kerry is going to meet again with Foreign Minister Lavrov.\xc2\xa0 The State Department said earlier this week that there would be no such meeting unless there were, in the words of Jen Psaki, \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that Russia is prepared to engage in these proposals and these discussions in a serious way.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, have we seen concrete evidence that Russia is now going to seriously engage on this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear to the Russians that we\xe2\x80\x99re open to further dialogue and that we want to see concrete evidence.\xc2\xa0 We view this as an opportunity, again, for Secretary Kerry to meet with Foreign Minister Lavrov, his counterpart, to discuss the situation in Ukraine, discuss the situation in Crimea, make clear that there is a way out of this diplomatically and peacefully that Russia can avail itself of, and to continue that discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly worth doing, in our view, because there are already costs associated with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s decisions here, its violations, and there will be greater costs, inevitably, if Russia continues down this path.\xc2\xa0 And those will be assessed -- those costs will be assessed by obviously the United States and our allies and our partners, but also by the impact on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy that these kinds of actions that flout international law and send signals to potential investors around the world that Russia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t abide by law -- international law -- that has a dramatic impact on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy and on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s status in the world.\xc2\xa0 If you want to participate in the international economy and do so responsibly, you need to demonstrate the kind of responsible behavior that does not include arbitrary violations of a neighboring nation\xe2\x80\x99s territory.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question was, have we seen any concrete evidence that Russia is softening its position on this or is willing to engage in a way that they have not until now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that why we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing Kerry go over there?\xc2\xa0 Because, again, they were saying there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be another --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand the question and all I would simply say is that we view it as appropriate for Secretary Kerry to meet again with Foreign Minister Lavrov to discuss again the situation, to make the case again for why a far better choice here would be to deescalate and for Russia to pursue its interests through the means available to it that are legal and have the endorsement of the international community.\xc2\xa0 Because as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, any further escalatory steps would make pursuing the diplomatic path more difficult, would raise the cost to Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as you know, the President is meeting with the Prime Minister of Ukraine today and that meeting will, by itself, I think demonstrate the fact that we strongly support the Ukrainian people; we strongly support Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty; we strongly support and urge the effort underway in Congress to pass legislation that would provide bilateral assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a stance taken not just by the United States but by countries throughout the region and the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick question about the Florida special election. So this is a district obviously that the President carried twice. It\xe2\x80\x99s a race you guys all thought you were going to win as recently as yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Taking a loss like this with a candidate you were very enthusiastic about, Democrats were enthusiastic about, and thought was going to win, does this mean you should be bracing for a tough fall?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this is a seat that was held by Republicans for 58 years -- longer than you and I by a lot have been alive.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not as long as we\xe2\x80\x99d like.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not as long as we\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this was a safe Republican seat for decades, A.\xc2\xa0 B, I am not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You thought you were going to win.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Democrats were confident this was --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We thought it was going to be close.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that it was going to be close I think demonstrates a number of things, including what the winner himself said upon winning when he was asked why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention the Affordable Care Act, which, of course, has been the focus of the analysis about the meaning and impact of this special election.\xc2\xa0 And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe national media and the pundits, they\xe2\x80\x99ll draw from the race what they want.\xc2\xa0 This was a clearly run race, we know that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t take a mandate from this.\xc2\xa0 I think what the national pundits think is they\xe2\x80\x99ve got some messaging homework to do maybe based on this race.\xc2\xa0 This was always a local race for me.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t wavered from that from the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that the Affordable Care Act was not a factor in the Democratic loss in this race?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, let me say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 Tempting as it is, given my background, I am not going to delve too deep into election analysis.\xc2\xa0 But I will note that any fair assessment of the role that the debate about the Affordable Care Act played reaches the conclusion that, at best for the Republicans it was a draw.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s evidenced by the fact that the Republican candidate himself didn\xe2\x80\x99t even mention it in his victory speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned a lot on his ads in his campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, can you explain -- you said, at best it was a draw?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 The effect of the Affordable Care Act, the debate that was, as Mara points out, a part of this election campaign for this special election in Florida, that the views on it at best from the Republican point of view created a draw; that it was not a negative or a positive, it was not the decisive factor for an outcome to a race -- which, by the way, resulted in a less than 2 percent victory in a special election -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a demographic here -- a special election, not a November election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the electorate I think, as anybody here who understands these things would acknowledge does not favor Democrats -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s a starting point -- was extremely close in a seat that had been held by Republicans for nearly 60 years.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s another thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say.\xc2\xa0 In 2006, Democrats lost every competitive special election and went on to pick up 31 seats in November.\xc2\xa0 In 2010, when House Democrats would go on to lose 63 seats and control of the chamber in the fall, they won every single competitive special election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a good sign.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a single race.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a single race, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a race that had a lot of peculiarities to it because it\xe2\x80\x99s a special -- as any special does, it\xe2\x80\x99s a race where, again, Republicans held the seat for 58 years, where they routinely won that seat by 30 or more points, and last night, they won by less than two points.\xc2\xa0 So it is what it is.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Mara.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify your remarks on Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 You say you\xe2\x80\x99re supporting the actions of Congress on loan guarantees.\xc2\xa0 But what about -- where are sanctions now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you said you wanted to isolate the Russian economy and really hurt Russia.\xc2\xa0 And now you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about if these steps continue -- I mean, where are you?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, there were actions already taken by the State Department when it comes to visa bans.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We never name individuals because that is not allowed under the rules when it comes to visas.\xc2\xa0 But that has taken effect.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the Europeans have announced that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done similar things.\xc2\xa0 The executive order created the authorities to impose sanctions on individuals and entities.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that those individuals whose job it is to focus specifically on developing sanctions and identifying targets of those sanctions are hard at work and that there will be consequences for the actions Russia has already taken to violate Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0The question moving forward -- so it\xe2\x80\x99s a both/and proposition.\xc2\xa0 There are costs that Russia has paid and will pay because of what it\xe2\x80\x99s already done, but there is also going to be further costs incurred -- if they fail to deescalate and they continue forward on the path they\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted, they try to annex Crimea illegally, there would be greater costs.\xc2\xa0 And that would come through sanctions and actions by our European partners and allies in addition to actions by the United States, as we take the steps that we are working with Congress to take to provide bilateral support, as we hopefully take steps with Congress to ensure that IMF quota reforms are passed so that the IMF is able to provide the maximum level of assistance to Ukraine and to the Ukrainian government at this very difficult time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the impact of all of this I think will be clear.\xc2\xa0 Russia has an opportunity to avoid further costs by deescalating, returning its military personnel to their bases, making sure that the levels are below -- at or below the maximum levels agreed to between the Ukrainian and Russian governments in Crimea, and to engage in a dialogue facilitated by international partners with the Ukrainian government on steps to move forward as the country moves towards elections in May.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will you say when you -- even if you can\xe2\x80\x99t name the specific people whose visas were banned, are you going to say when they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually started?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The visa bans are in effect.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re separating -- there are two separate actions.\xc2\xa0 When we announced the executive order last week, we also announced -- the State Department did -- that they had taken action on visa bans.\xc2\xa0 But as I understand it, they\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to identify individuals publicly in that process, but that has happened.\xc2\xa0 Separate from that \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people have had their visa banned?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And assets frozen also?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These are visa bans.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So the sanctions have to do with the authorities created by or authorized by the executive order.\xc2\xa0 And that process is underway and it is a very broad and flexible tool that we have available to us.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Margaret.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks -- a couple on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the loan guarantees, kind of to get into the nitty-gritty -- the Senate wants to attach the IMF reforms to it; the House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. I know the White House would probably prefer to get some IMF stuff done, too, but have you made a strategic decision on whether you\'re really willing to go to the mat on this?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to take the fight to the House to try to get both done, or are you going to step back?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about this:\xc2\xa0 We all support -- Democrats and Republicans -- providing substantial assistance to Ukraine during this difficult time, to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 The support that we can provide through the loan guarantee program bilaterally is substantial, and Congress needs to take action to make sure that happens.\xc2\xa0 But all along, our view has been -- and I think this is shared by Democrats and Republicans on the Hill -- that whatever bilateral assistance the United States is able to provide should serve as a complement to the substantial assistance the International Monetary Fund can and should provide.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So if lawmakers view it that way, as I understand they do, then it is absolutely in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s interest and the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest as well as in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s interest that these quota reforms from 2010 are passed, which would enable the IMF to provide broader and deeper assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s no cost associated in terms of additional funding from the United States for that to happen, but we strongly support the passage of IMF quota reforms because, in general, it\'s the right thing to do and, specifically, when it comes to providing assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people at this difficult time, it\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- okay, it\'s important, it\'s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 Do you think -- so do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re swayable or --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'re working with Congress in both -- and members in both houses and leaders in both houses to move this forward.\xc2\xa0 And we are making the arguments that I just made to you about why it\'s important for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sake that the assistance package and the quota reform pass.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on Ukraine, everything is still on for this afternoon here, right?\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister had cancelled a press conference.\xc2\xa0 So no changes to his schedule you\'re aware of?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of anything.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that meeting, do you expect the President, beyond the support that we all know he\'ll talk about publicly probably in the spray, do you expect him to get into some nitty-gritty details about, starting on Sunday, assuming that this referendum passes, about what the U.S. will do in concert with Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 Some of that, like, what happens next stuff?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\'ll point you to the President, who will have the opportunity to talk to the pool at the end of the meeting that he has for a summary of what the discussion was. But I think it\'s fair to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss all of the above when it comes to the situation that Ukraine is currently experiencing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would you be willing to preview for us that the U.S. at least has decided if the referendum goes the way everyone thinks it\'s going to go what you will do next?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it would be great if you want to announce it here, but if not, has the President reached a decision on what he does Sunday?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, Secretary Kerry is going to London to meet with Foreign Minister Lavrov on Friday and we certainly hope that Russia makes a decision to follow a different path to deescalate and to pursue the diplomatic avenue open to it for resolving this conflict.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to start speculating about what actions we would take except to assure you that the international community would surely take actions if Ukraine -- rather, Russia continues down this path.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one -- so what he\xe2\x80\x99s asking is -- when you say to take a different path, not yank the referendum, but just not to take the ball and run with it?\xc2\xa0 Is that the path?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s following up on Jen\xe2\x80\x99s question from earlier.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that what Russia needs to do is return its forces back to their bases, make sure that the level of Russian military personnel in Crimea is consistent with the agreements between the Ukrainian government and the Russian government, engage in a dialogue with the help of the international community and international partners with the Ukrainian government about the issues that have arisen here towards free and fair elections in May that have been called for by the Ukrainian government when there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the Ukrainian people to choose their President in a democratic way and where all voices in Ukraine are heard and represented at the polling stations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the goal of the Kerry-Lavrov meeting is not to see that the referendum doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table you think as an option?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the referendum -- which, if held, would not be recognized, its results would not be recognized, is not legal under the Ukrainian consititution -- is a part of the puzzle here.\xc2\xa0 What we have called on Russia to do is to take action that it\xe2\x80\x99s directly responsible for, which is the movement of its military and its actions consistent with its agreements with the Ukrainians.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this meeting is not about seeking the scrubbing of the referendum?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, since we don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and neither does the Ukrainain government; most importantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not helpful when it comes to reducing tensions or deescalating the situation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the referendum itself, to use your words earlier, an \xe2\x80\x9cescalating step\xe2\x80\x9d in this crisis?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then if there was a subsequent -- as the Russians have indicated there will be -- parliamentary action to annex, that would clearly fall into that category as well?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That would qualify as escalatory, which is a word I had not known existed before this morning.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you used it so I wanted to give you another chance.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what word -- a lawyer I think wrote this.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clear up a couple things from Betsey\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 She implied -- I just want to make sure -- that the administration had looked at this issue about overtime but didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the labor force could withstand it earlier and closer to the Great Recession and now is a more opportune time economically to do that.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair interpretation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she say that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, she\xe2\x80\x99s the economist.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure that\'s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to what she said.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is fair to say the economy is much stronger now than it was in during its period of free fall.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would have been harmful earlier.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s potentially less harmful now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make that economic assessment.\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair for a layman to say that the economy, having added the millions of jobs it\xe2\x80\x99s added, having grown as steadily as it\xe2\x80\x99s grown, is in a much stronger position today than it was in 2008 or 2009 when it was in free fall.\xc2\xa0 I think the points that Betsey made about the fundamental fairness of ensuring that this rule is modernized are pretty unassailable. I mean, if the rule was right in 1975 and the level set in 1975 is consistent with $1,000 a week today or whatever it was, and is half that now, then why is what was fair then not fair now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My only question is, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you do it sooner, and the answer is the labor market wasn\xe2\x80\x99t capable of withstanding --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think she addressed that.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking constantly for ways to expand opportunity, reward hard work, and reward those who take responsibility for themselves and their families, and this is another way to do that that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with past practice, that ensures that folks who are working 60 hours a week and whose incomes surpasses a certain threshold aren\xe2\x80\x99t being deprived of overtime because of the way their labor is categorized.\xc2\xa0 So that just seems I think -- you test that principle around the country you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that it is overwhelmingly supported.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the CIA situation.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that you wanted -- the administration wanted the declassification of the Senate report, but then you also said all other relevant reports. Does that mean the Panetta review you want declassified and the CIA responses to the -- because I asked that yesterday and you weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying all those things should be declassified.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the so-called Panetta review is a series -- as I understand it, a series of documents that\xe2\x80\x99s not really a collected review, so to speak, but it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the -- it is related to the protocol that has resulted in the provision of millions of pages of documents, unprecedented number of documents to the committee as part of its investigation.\xc2\xa0 There have been, as I talked about yesterday and earlier today, disputes about the process around that protocol and some of those disputes are being reviewed by the Inspector General and by the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0But when it comes to the steps that the President wants to see, he wants a completion of this report; he wants the committee to submit a request for declassification so that we can move with dispatch to declassify its findings appropriately.\xc2\xa0 And my point was simply that all views on this certainly should be --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the CIA also to go through a declassification process of its work product.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without getting into too many -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- my understanding is we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a series of drafts and papers and things like that that are just part of the overall millions of pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 And what the select committee assigned itself to do and what the administration has been providing or the agency has been providing documents for to do is investigate the practices, the enhanced interrogation techniques that were employed under the previous administration that Senator Obama strenuously objected to, promised to end, and ended on his second full day in office.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, again, as I mentioned yesterday --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between the CIA criticizing itself and the Senate Select Committee criticizing the CIA.\xc2\xa0 And those two things are different -- they are in different sort of inboxes, if you will.\xc2\xa0 And both can be declassified.\xc2\xa0 And one of them is the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a discussion about documents I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen or a review that\xe2\x80\x99s underway -- excellent point.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is this President wants you to be able to see declassified findings from the Senate Select Committee\xe2\x80\x99s report as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 And if the CIA has produced or wants to produce its own assessment of that report, we would want to see that declassified appropriately for public consumption.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the reason why I mentioned this is you obviously have the majority and the minority in the committee -- if separate reports, separate findings, the President would like to see those appropriately declassified and made public as well.\xc2\xa0 Because the President\xe2\x80\x99s view in this has been consistent all along that the practices were not consistent with our values as a nation, they never should have happened.\xc2\xa0 He ended them immediately upon taking office, and he endorsed an investigation that has now been going on for roughly five years that he hopes to see conclude quickly so that the public can be made aware of its findings.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this focus today -- women in the economy, minimum wage, overtime, pay increases as well -- all important policy areas as was discussed at the top.\xc2\xa0 But will you also acknowledge these are also issues that test pretty well in an election year and that are a lot better to focus on than, say, the health care numbers from yesterday?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, are you saying that we should have done this in 2012 because our margin with women wasn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your margin was pretty strong, so that might help you again in the midterms.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These are the right things to do for the economy.\xc2\xa0 No, Ed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this has nothing to do with the midterms?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what, I think every woman in here ought to be offended by that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m offended by it on behalf of my wife and my daughter.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major asked about the over -- I thought when Major asked about the overtime issue and if you increased can you show that that will help women, and Betsey said, well, we\xe2\x80\x99re studying that.\xc2\xa0 Is there a specific tie-in?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The overtime -- altering and modernizing the rules regarding overtime is the right thing to do for the whole economy.\xc2\xa0 And she was asked if that disproportionately affects women in the way that raising the minimum wage does.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- numbers on it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just that they run numbers on it --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that assessment has been done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the right thing to do regardless.\xc2\xa0 The assessments that have been done related to the minimum wage is that women would be affected more than men because women tend to have minimum wage jobs, as I understand it, not an economist, in greater number than men do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But here\xe2\x80\x99s the point -- and I mentioned my wife\xe2\x80\x99s book on this -- I mean, there is a macroeconomic benefit to making sure --<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What book?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWomenomics.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the title of it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWomenomics.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it available on Amazon?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Amazon.\xc2\xa0 It came out in 2009.\xc2\xa0 It might have been on the New York Times Bestseller list.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m only saying this because I happen to know, because of that, a little bit about this subject -- that there are bottom line benefits to making sure that the private and the public sector make sure that the rules of the road, if you will, when it comes to our economy, work for women because doing that is not just the right thing to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s economically beneficial.\xc2\xa0 It helps the bottom line.\xc2\xa0 It helps the country\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line and it helps the private sector bottom line.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to jump on you.\xc2\xa0 But this is not about -- this is good for the economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe.\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy, I promise you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And your wife is wonderful, a very nice person.\xc2\xa0 Health care, a quick one -- I know we\xe2\x80\x99re short on time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got all day.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you can say you\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress.\xc2\xa0 Millions of people are signing up.\xc2\xa0 You can clearly cite progress.\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be happy that at the beginning you said, based on CBO projections, that you needed 38 percent of the people signing up to be 18- to 34-year-olds and the percentage now is 25 percent.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me that -- are you really happy with that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then, also, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that Lance Bass apparently showed up at the White House a short time ago, and said he is meeting with the President on health care.\xc2\xa0 Will we see the President do something with \xe2\x80\x98N Sync or anyone -- anything like that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you can be assured of, as I think we demonstrated yesterday, that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at every way possible to make sure that communities across the country are getting the information they need to make the choices available to them.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes that means using non-traditional means to reach folks, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t all get their news or their information from the same sources that we do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0But on the question of the numbers, it\xe2\x80\x99s March 12th.\xc2\xa0 And we have only a few more weeks until the end of the open enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 And what I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we are at the end.\xc2\xa0 Some of the targets that you talk about are related to CBO figures, that when it comes to the demographics had more to do with the percentage of young adults who made up -- within the population of the uninsured.\xc2\xa0 I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Massachusetts experience, the figures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved thus far are consistent with where Massachusetts was roughly.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no question we got off to a really bad start, and that was on us.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of effort was put into making sure that the website and the problems with it were fixed.\xc2\xa0 Once that happened, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the American people\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the product not waver at all, despite all the obstacles to obtaining it that were put in front of them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a consistent growth in enrollments and including youth enrollments.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what comes on April 1st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clear up a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One, I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed, I think this is the second or third time you guys put out a statement that says \xe2\x80\x9cG7 Nations.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there an announcement?\xc2\xa0 Is there no more G8?\xc2\xa0 Like, how do --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I actually covered a G7 once.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how long I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it -- are they out?\xc2\xa0 Is it now this is going to be the way -- the new norm?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s semantics.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, this is a fair question.\xc2\xa0 We and the other G7 nations have suspended preparations for the G8 meeting in Sochi, because it is inconceivable to us that we can move forward with those preparations given the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And it is hard to see how that would change if Russia does not deescalate and choose a different course.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0We are consulting regularly with our G7 partners, and we put out the statement that you mentioned this morning.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to project into the future here, because Russia has an opportunity to make some decisions that allow Russia to pursue and protect its interests.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve suspended them from the G8 but not kicked them out yet?\xc2\xa0 Is that fair to say?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve suspended preparations on the next meeting of the G8, which happens to be --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that you speak as the G7 almost, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that the equivalent of Russia suspended and --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in this case, one member of the G8, Russia, has taken actions that made it necessary for the G7 to speak as the G7.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the CIA story, are you pledging that the President also wants to make public the Panetta report that was done --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what Major said -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is it that report, too, that will get declassified?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, what I can tell you is that the discussions and disputes -- did I just call you Major?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The worse insult Chuck has ever gotten.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I take it as a compliment.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You have a title in your name -- I mean, that\'s pretty good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s like, his first name is Colonel.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, what I can tell you is that the discussions and disputes about the protocol that was in place, that has been in place since early 2009, that governs the provision of obviously sensitive documents from the CIA to the committee and that has been the subject of disputes, involves a variety of documents, as has been reported and as I understand it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0I\'m not going to get into the disposition of individual documents.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s strongly held view and strongly expressed view to the relevant parties here that the committee ought to finish its work, submit the final product for declassification so that it can be declassified -- the findings can be -- appropriately, as quickly as possible, so that we can make it public.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to alternative views and assessments, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re the minority\xe2\x80\x99s views or the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views, that would -- it is our view that all of these assessments ought to be --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a subtle allegation that Brennan is somehow changing the report that Panetta\xe2\x80\x99s team did.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, all I can tell you is I\'m not going to wade into the details of this.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that the so-called report -- and I\'m basing this on press reports -- is not a report per se, but that we are talking about millions of documents here of which there are some that fall under that label, and that the disputes around some of the provision of some of those documents and how they\xe2\x80\x99ve been handled are being looked at and reviewed appropriately by the Inspector General and by the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Udall has a hold on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to be General Counsel at the CIA.\xc2\xa0 Part of the reason is he does not believe that her -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see her confirmed because of her belief that she believes that legal memos that govern the CIA activities on interrogations and drone strikes should not be made available to Congress.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President on this issue?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know that we took action early on to release the OLA memo --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is about new memos going forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a statement of our views and policies on this.\xc2\xa0 What I know is that our nominee -- his nominee to that position is highly qualified and we certainly, as is the case with all nominees, hope and expect the Senate will act expeditiously.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you make this change, though, would the President agree to say despite her personal opinion, he believes that these memos should be made available to Congress?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\'t adjudicate hypothetical memos and whether or not -- especially ones on highly sensitive matters that have to do with intelligence collection -- whether or not they ought to be disseminated.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is this President has taken unprecedented --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just made available to Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is talking about disseminating public --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying I don\'t have a view to express on that.\xc2\xa0 What I do have a view on is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee ought to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Justin.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Ukraine aid bill, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- it doesn\'t seem like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to move through the Senate this week before people leave for recess.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\'s concerning to you guys?\xc2\xa0 And how much disappointment is there, especially since the President said last week he wanted to see --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We want to see Congress act on it quickly.\xc2\xa0 We think that a lot of members have publicly stated their views on the transgression we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Russia, on the plight of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 In this circumstance, it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely appropriate for members to channel those observations and feelings into action, and that action is in the form of legislation that would provide loan guarantees to the government of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So we want to see that happen as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>In terms of the makeup of that legislative package -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that a couple of times today -- it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that as part of the effort to make sure that Ukraine is getting as much assistance as possible from the international community, that the quota reforms ought to be passed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t see it as important to get it done before the meeting on Friday, or the referendum --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not putting -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get it done, absolutely, as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 One on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether the U.S. or Russia initiated Friday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Kerry announced the fact that he was going to London today when he was up on the Hill, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure who initiated it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we want to continue diplomatic discussions with Russia and to see concrete action taken by Russia to deescalate the situation.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know who called whom.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then separately on immigration, House Republicans have introduced a couple of proposals this week that would challenge the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to enforce immigration laws.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve put out two statements on the restriction policies saying the President would veto them.\xc2\xa0 But what does it say about the momentum, if there was any before, for overhauling the immigration system?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great question because there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot of discussion about the path forward for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We saw an enormous amount of energy and effort in the Senate that resulted in a bipartisan compromise that received a substantial majority vote in the Senate -- Democrats and Republicans passed -- and that bill, while not word-for-word what the President would have written, is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles and consistent with the idea that we have to do this comprehensively so that we solve all of these problems associated with our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>We were encouraged when we saw leaders in the House put forward their standards, their principles for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That was a positive step, and it suggested that the House might be ready to move forward and that we could be making progress when it comes to seeing comprehensive immigration reform pass the Congress and get to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk so he could sign it.</p>\n<p>So it is, in my view, in our view, pretty amazing that today House Republicans went in the opposite direction by passing legislation targeting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy that removed the threat of deportation for young people brought to this country as children, known as DREAMers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The House Judiciary Committee made clear that both the ENFORCE Act, that you mention, and the Faithful Execution of the Law Act were promoted in part by that policy and opposition to it.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, this is the second time House Republicans have targeted DREAMers during this Congress, following up on the amendment sponsored by Representative Steve King last year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And let\xe2\x80\x99s think about that:\xc2\xa0 This runs contrary to our most deeply held values as Americans, and asks law enforcement officials to treat these DREAMers the same way as they would treat those with criminal records, those with violent criminal records.</p>\n<p>We urge House Republicans to focus on actually fixing our broken immigration system to provide opportunity for all, instead of legislation designed to deny opportunity to those who are Americans in every way -- in their hearts, in their minds, in their experiences -- in very way but on paper.</p>\n<p>So you hear a lot of talk about where people are on this issue.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t require much to look at what House Republicans are doing today to question whether or not they\'re serious about moving forward on comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:36 P.M.
