Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:40 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for being here.\xc2\xa0 As I think we advised earlier today for this gaggle, I have with me Danny Werfel, Federal Controller for the Office of Management and Budget; as well as Jason Furman, Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re here to discuss with you what would be the devastating impacts of the sequester if it is allowed to take effect, if Congress fails to do the responsible thing, which is to give itself the time and space it needs to pursue a broader budget that would achieve deficit reduction in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I will turn it over first to Danny Werfel and then to Jason.</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I know all of you have a paper that was provided that has information on the impacts of the sequester on the domestic side.\xc2\xa0 I want to take a moment and talk about how the across-the-board cuts under sequestration would operate and why they would be so harmful to our nation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I want to emphasize that the administration believes sequestration is bad policy that was never intended to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 It was intended to drive both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to compromise.\xc2\xa0 Sequester is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument that poses a serious threat to our national security, domestic priorities, and the economy.\xc2\xa0 And it does not represent a responsible way to achieve deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>As I think you\xe2\x80\x99re all aware, the fiscal cliff deal included a fully paid-for two-month delay in sequestration, pushing the scheduled implementation date back to March 1st, which is now three weeks away.\xc2\xa0 The deal did lower the amount of the sequester cut for this year to $85 billion, but this is obviously still a very substantial amount.\xc2\xa0 And we now have a shortened timeframe for achieving the cut -- seven months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>OMB now calculates that sequestration will require an annual reduction of roughly 5 percent for nondefense programs and roughly 8 percent for defense programs.\xc2\xa0 However, given that these cuts must be achieved over only a seven-month period instead of a twelve-month period, the effective percentage reductions will be approximately 9 percent for nondefense programs and 13 percent for defense programs.\xc2\xa0 These are large and arbitrary cuts, and will have severe impacts across government.</p>\n<p>On multiple occasions, the President has laid his plan for more than $4 trillion in balanced deficit reduction, and he has demonstrated his strong commitment and willingness to reach agreement on further balanced deficit reduction that avoids sequestration.\xc2\xa0 If we do not get an agreement to avoid the sequester, as I mentioned earlier, there would be significant and harmful consequences across the spectrum of both domestic and defense priorities.\xc2\xa0 And from the document that was provided, you can see that the cuts would cause very significant disruptions that would be felt far and wide across the country.</p>\n<p>There has been in the public domain a lot of discussion to date about the impact that the sequester would have on the defense realm.\xc2\xa0 And let me be clear, those impacts would be severe and must not be allowed to occur.\xc2\xa0 As Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey have both said on numerous occasions, sequestration would create a serious crisis in military readiness and pose the risk of creating a hollow force by undercutting the essential services, equipment, and support our Armed Forces rely on.</p>\n<p>But the impacts on our domestic priorities as a nation would be just as severe.\xc2\xa0 Let me go through some of the examples.\xc2\xa0 Six hundred thousand women and children would lose vital nutrition assistance.\xc2\xa0 Not only would this reduce essential benefits that these families depend on, but it could cost at least 1,600 state and local jobs due to reduced federal funding.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Approximately 70,000 children would lose Head Start and Early Head Start services.\xc2\xa0 The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation would have to significantly cut back or delay thousands of research grants and awards, setting back progress on research into life-threatening illnesses and costing tens of thousands of jobs for scientists and students.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture would have to cut back on food inspections, leaving the country more vulnerable to public health risks due to foodborne illnesses.\xc2\xa0 The FBI would have to reduce its law enforcement capacity.\xc2\xa0 FEMA would have to eliminate funding for firefighters and other emergency personnel.\xc2\xa0 And the Justice Department would have to furlough hundreds of federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>As you can see, in the list that we distributed there are more impacts that I do not cover here.\xc2\xa0 The list that you have has additional ones, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.\xc2\xa0 There are many, many other impacts that are not in the document.\xc2\xa0 The document just represents some of the ones that we\xe2\x80\x99re highlighting.</p>\n<p>Across the government we\xe2\x80\x99ll see assistance programs slashed; we\xe2\x80\x99ll see contracts cut; we\xe2\x80\x99ll see employees out of work.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have no choice.\xc2\xa0 The blunt, irresponsible, and severe nature of sequestration means that we can\xe2\x80\x99t plan our way out of these consequences or take steps to soften the blow.</p>\n<p>To reiterate, that\xe2\x80\x99s why it is so critical that Congress acts swiftly to avoid these cuts through a balanced approach to further deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Instead of arbitrary, across-the-board cuts, we need to be carefully reducing the deficit in a way that protects the most vulnerable, protects critical priorities, creates jobs, and strengthens the middle class.</p>\n<p>Let me turn it over to Jason Furman who is going to talk through some additional issues from his perspective.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And after the President\xe2\x80\x99s experience with the cameramen Tuesday, I told Jay I\xe2\x80\x99d only come back here if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t here, so thank you for that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>I just want to underscore some of Danny\xe2\x80\x99s points and put a tiny bit of broader economic context around it.\xc2\xa0 Danny went through the programmatic consequences -- what this would mean for education, medical, research, public safety, and a whole range of things.\xc2\xa0 And those would all be very damaging and very severe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The sequester would also have broader and very negative consequences for the economy as a whole.\xc2\xa0 And private forecasters, the Congressional Budget Office, and others have estimated that if the sequester hit you would lose hundreds of thousands of jobs as a result.\xc2\xa0 And we got a tiny bit of a preview of what that might look like in the fourth quarter GDP numbers, where GDP contracted because of a large contraction in defense spending that was, at least in part, due just to fears about the sequester before it even started to hit.</p>\n<p>That type of contraction in the deficit, a very large and abrupt and immediate and poorly implemented one in 2013, is especially unnecessary because of the trajectory of what\'s happening to the deficit right now.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made enormous progress in bringing the deficit down over the last four years.\xc2\xa0 We are slated to make a lot of progress to bring the deficit down over the next couple of years.\xc2\xa0 The big challenge we have is over the medium and long terms.\xc2\xa0 Let me talk about that first part first, and then about the medium and long term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The deficit this year is projected to be about 5 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0 It\'s come down by nearly 5 percentage points in the last four years.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the most rapid pace of deficit reduction the United States has seen since the end of World War II.\xc2\xa0 The reason we\'re seeing this is in part due to the recovery of the economy, but also in part because the President has already signed into law $2.5 trillion of deficit reduction, including $1.4 trillion of spending cuts through the continuing resolutions and Budget Control Act, and another $600 billion of revenue from high-income households in the tax agreement and then the associated intrasavings.</p>\n<p>So that $2.5 trillion gets you more than halfway to the $4 trillion that you need to stabilize your debt over the long term, and it actually has been sufficient to be bringing your deficit down quite strongly over the short run.</p>\n<p>What we do need, though, is a lot more medium- and long-term deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the second reason why it would be a real shame to just take the attitude that we should just let the sequester hit rather than doing something else; take the attitude that, oh, the sequester is spending cuts, we want spending cuts, let\'s just do it that way.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not just programmatically damaging for the reasons that Danny outlined, it\'s not just macroeconomically damaging in terms of costing jobs, it also misses a really huge opportunity for this country -- one that I think Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree is a better approach than this type of blunt, mindless, bad-policy approach.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s an approach that, one, the President came out and reiterated -- in fact, reiterated it twice in his remarks in this briefing room on Tuesday -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of big deal that still remains on the table, from his perspective.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal that includes health savings that, in the tenth year, would match or exceed the savings in Bowles-Simpson and would grow more quickly over time.\xc2\xa0 So you would actually have more health savings than in the sequester, more health savings over the long term than in Bowles-Simpson.\xc2\xa0 That would include tax reform that could do something like on corporate tax rates, bring our rates down a lot and make our country more competitive.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an approach that would also bring us more deficit reduction, amount of deficit reduction sufficient to bring down and ultimately stabilize our debt measured as a share of the economy.</p>\n<p>Of course, as the President said, there\xe2\x80\x99s not time to do all of that in the next couple of weeks, first of all.\xc2\xa0 Second of all, there\'s been interest on a bipartisan basis in Congress in proceeding through budget resolutions in something more like regular order to bring this all about.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a process that takes time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what we\'re trying to do now is make sure that Congress can buy the time it needs in order to do this entitlement reform, tax reform that\'s a much better solution to our problems than letting the sequester hit, and doing that in a balanced way with a combination of revenue and spending that would buy you some time on the sequester.\xc2\xa0 The whole goal of buying that time is not for the sake of buying time; it\'s for the sake of buying time to do something that\'s a lot bigger and a lot better than the sequester in terms of entitlement reform, tax reform, stabilizing our deficit and ultimately the goal being creating jobs and economic growth.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So if we could have questions for these two gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 And if we have a little time at the back, I\'ll be here for a few minutes after that.</p>\n<p>Questions?\xc2\xa0 Roger.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you just said that you\'d like to buy time on the sequester, you\'re saying postpone March 1st, but substitute what?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 A balanced combination of spending and revenue measures.\xc2\xa0 We have already had an example of this with the two-month delay that we did as part of the ATRA.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re talking about something like that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying another two months.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something Congress would need to work out the period.\xc2\xa0 Congress would need to work out --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid said like three months or something.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Congress really needs to work out the amount of time.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to work out the amount of pay-fors.\xc2\xa0 Where we\'re coming from is that we\'d want to see -- and I don\'t think you could pass the Senate without seeing something that has a balance of revenue and spending.\xc2\xa0 And we had a template for that in the ATRA.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the type of thing we\'d like to see going forward.</p>\n<p>I don\'t know the exact amount of time you\'d need for a bigger budget agreement.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t appear that this Congress would be able to do that in the next three weeks, so we certainly need more time than that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have an offer?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 What?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have an offer?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have -- the President said that his -- the offers that he made in December remain on the table.\xc2\xa0 So he has a plan on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The numbers here, do they come from Treasury or OMB?\xc2\xa0 And how do you know that this sort of dire portrait that you paint of life under sequester will actually happen if the sequester goes through?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 The numbers actually come from the federal agencies that are responsible for carrying out the program.\xc2\xa0 So HHS, for example, helped analyze the situation and develop a Head Start assessment and so on.\xc2\xa0 And these are experts, programmatic experts.\xc2\xa0 They are constantly monitoring the manner in which federal dollars go into the field and how they\'re impacted, and they\'re evaluating what a very significant and sudden arbitrary cut would do.\xc2\xa0 And so we rely on the agencies to provide that expertise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about how this thing would be implemented?\xc2\xa0 Is it a cliff?\xc2\xa0 Is it a slope?\xc2\xa0 Do 800 women lose their nutrition on March 1st?\xc2\xa0 Or how does it work?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 So from a technical standpoint, what happens is that if we have to issue the sequester order and move into this phase on March 1st, essentially it cancels $85 billion in budgetary resources that agencies previously had available.\xc2\xa0 So they now have to get to the end of the fiscal year, across government, on a budget that now has $85 billion less than it once did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, agencies are going to have to carry out and get to the finish line in a way that\'s most effective to meet their mission.\xc2\xa0 And so, in some cases, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see variation.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see immediate impacts.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases, agencies will work out those changes to their programs and their structures over time.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no easy answer to say what the world is going to look like on March 2nd.\xc2\xa0 We just know that these impacts -- while not all of them immediate -- if we don\'t take action, they will take place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the administration started to put any contingency plans in place?\xc2\xa0 And just to go back to the time issue again, is there a minimum length of time the President would accept, a couple of months -- three to six?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think on the time we said that\'s something we want Congress to work out.\xc2\xa0 And certainly three months [sic] isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough time to come to the type of agreement we\xe2\x80\x99d like to come to.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Three weeks.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Three weeks, sorry.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I meant three weeks is certainly not enough time.</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 And on the contingency plan, remember sequester was scheduled to take place initially in January.\xc2\xa0 Prior to that, as there was uncertainty around a fiscal cliff deal, OMB was working with federal agencies on their planning activities, and obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve resumed that in anticipation of March 1st.\xc2\xa0 So agencies are working through exactly how they are going to execute under this very significant cut in their budgetary resources.\xc2\xa0 Those planning activities are ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have agencies started to issue letters to employees warning of furlough and the like?\xc2\xa0 Or when will that start happening?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 So what happened as recently as last week is agency heads sent notices out to their broad base of employees kind of updating them on where things are in terms of sequester planning, and did in that message -- many of these agencies sent this type of message -- indicated that, unfortunately, in order to meet these budget cuts, that furloughs in many cases are a likely outcome in order to do this.\xc2\xa0 Now, that was in a broad way.</p>\n<p>Under the law, before an employee can be furloughed, they need a specific notice of their furlough with a specific amount of time.\xc2\xa0 In most cases, it\xe2\x80\x99s 30 days, but it depends on a lot of different factors.\xc2\xa0 But as a general rule, a 30-day notice is typically what\xe2\x80\x99s required.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific notices that have been issued.\xc2\xa0 But if we go past this date, there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to implement the sequester without significant furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal employees.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more specific number on that?\xc2\xa0 How many employees and contract employees would be facing this?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 At this point in time I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific estimate.\xc2\xa0 I just know it\xe2\x80\x99s high; it\xe2\x80\x99s in the hundreds of thousands of employees, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific estimate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just -- can you give me an understanding of what the sequester -- how much it ties your hands -- I mean, the individual agencies.\xc2\xa0 Because some might say, well, why do you have to cut these crucial programs; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you find some ways elsewhere?\xc2\xa0 But does it really tie your hands as to where you can make those cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 It does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me to be a little bit technical.\xc2\xa0 What happens is, OMB, we take this amount, this $85 billion that we have to cut, and we apply it to every account in government.\xc2\xa0 Every account has to be cut by a certain percentage.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like the agencies can move money amongst accounts.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s even worse than that.\xc2\xa0 Even at the subaccount, there\xe2\x80\x99s something called Program, Project and Activity, which exists within each account.\xc2\xa0 And the way the sequester law is written, is that even -- underneath the account, even at the Program, Project and Activity, they all need to be cut by that same percentage.</p>\n<p>So, for example, FAA, they have to cut resources in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s going to impact the air traffic controller workforce.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no way to basically say, well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to take all the cuts in this area, like maintenance or custodial work.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to do that because the law is written with such stricture that the cuts have to be taken at such a granular level.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why when I say it\xe2\x80\x99s across the board, indiscriminate --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t agree on substitute cuts, could they pass a provision saying that the agency would have more leeway; you would still need to cut the same percentage from each department or each agency, but you have more leeway and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go into -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to cut air traffic controllers for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xc2\xa0 You can cut something else?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at this question.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t see a way in which you can cut $85 billion over a seven-month period and not have significantly harmful impacts to our priorities, both domestic and defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything on this list you could live with cutting in a deal that would be worked out with Congress, or does everything here have to stay?\xc2\xa0 Question one.\xc2\xa0 Jason, for you -- if there is a two- or three-month continuous delay of the sequester, based on what you saw in the fourth quarter, do you believe there is an economic harm just associated with that two- or three-month process?\xc2\xa0 And lastly, looking at all this, do you regret that this White House suggested this in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the last one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not involved in the specific negotiations and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s details that Congress is going to need to be worked out.\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined here is impacts are extraordinarily troublesome.\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pull one out and say, yes, the defense priorities, the domestic priorities, health, education -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to isolate one of those and say this is something that we should tolerate.\xc2\xa0 But, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not really my decision.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99ll be -- Congress needs to do its work and then ultimate decisions will be made.\xc2\xa0 And the President will make a decision on the best interests of the nation.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Right now, Major, there\xe2\x80\x99s two options on the table.\xc2\xa0 One is the sequester hits, and the second is there\xe2\x80\x99s a short-term delay of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that economically that second option, a short-term delay of the sequester, would be far superior to the former.</p>\n<p>What would make that option even better is if American people and American businesses really appreciated that the reason you are doing that was in order to build time and space for something that was even better than either of those options, which was more medium- and long-term deficit reduction, reforming our entitlements, reforming our tax code, making ourselves more competitive, and permanently ending this fiscal cliff after fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that that\xe2\x80\x99s better.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And part of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to convince people is, A, the short term is much better than nothing -- much, much better than nothing; and, B, the short term will be even better if people see it as momentum and movement towards continuing to solve our problems.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The notion much propounded by the spin doctors on the Republican side that the sequester is somehow something that the White House or the President alone wanted or desired is a fanciful confection.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, as I think you all recall in the wake of the passage of the Budget Control Act, it was the Republicans, including the Republican Leader of the House, who celebrated it as getting 98 percent of what they wanted.</p>\n<p>The sequester was designed as a means of creating a trigger that would get us out of what was a terrible situation that was already doing enormous harm to our economy, which we now know, and that was the threat of default.\xc2\xa0 It was designed by Republicans and Democrats to be so onerous that it would never come into place because it would force and compel Congress to do something more responsible, which is reduce the deficit -- not through spending cuts alone -- but reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would note it was certainly our preference, the White House\xe2\x80\x99s preference, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s preference, even in the sequester process, that it would be -- that revenues would be part of sequester -- revenues as well as defense and nondefense cuts.\xc2\xa0 Republicans adamantly refused to go along with that proposition.\xc2\xa0 Had they not, we would be in certainly a different situation today than we are now.</p>\n<p>So I understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s a convenient bit of spin but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot of baloney.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he regret it anyway?\xc2\xa0 I mean, regardless of whose idea it was, does he now, looking at all of the consequences that are --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What he regrets is that we ever had a circumstance like this country was forced to contend with in the summer of 2011 that there was a certain amount of enthusiasm even within the Republican Party, especially within the House, for the prospect of the United States defaulting on its obligations for the first time in its history -- an enthusiasm that somehow was linked to a belief that it would help the Republican Party achieve ideological goals that the nation overwhelmingly rejected -- rejected then, rejected last year, rejected in the campaign, rejected at the end of the year when we had our fiscal cliff negotiation, and rejects today.</p>\n<p>So that the President regrets.\xc2\xa0 He could not let the country default for the first time, and thus the sequester and the Budget Control Act and everything associated with it, including the super committee, was born.\xc2\xa0 The whole point in its design was that it would never come to pass.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans would go along with the simple proposition that the American people overwhelmingly support -- which is that we need a balanced approach to further deficit reduction -- we would have solved this already.</p>\n<p>It has been, I think to their -- it\'s been their loss, in terms of public opinion, that they\'ve refused to go along with this.\xc2\xa0 And it has been to the country\'s detriment, because we keep having to deal with these manufactured crises that are terrible for the economy, that hardly inspire confidence with the American people or globally in our capacity to deal with our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We need to return to normalcy when it comes to how we debate and decide these issues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to -- failing a big deal now, we need to pass an extension, a short-term buy-down, to allow Congress to do what it seems to be inclined to do, which is to return a semblance of regular order and a budget process that hopefully will result in a final product that reflects the proposition of balance that is supported by the vast majority of the American people, by Republicans and Democrats across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President hopes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on a previous question, what\xe2\x80\x99s -- you laid out the two scenarios.\xc2\xa0 What is your best estimate of the hit to GDP if the sequester takes effect or if there\xe2\x80\x99s that short-term uncertainty?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have an estimate.\xc2\xa0 Others, independent forecasters, CBO have done estimates.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to put it in context, which is that we did solve the majority of the fiscal cliff at the end of December.\xc2\xa0 The largest item was what was going to happen on taxes, and then we also dealt with the SGR and unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question defense spending was the difference between a positive GDP number and a negative GDP number in the fourth quarter.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that it would be the difference between that again in the future, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that this would make a big difference and, as I said, hundreds of thousands of jobs and a commensurate amount of GDP would be lost as a result relative to what otherwise would have happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with CBO\xe2\x80\x99s estimates on the impact of the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have a specific opinion on CBO\xe2\x80\x99s, but they\'re never very far off in terms of something like this.\xc2\xa0 So maybe they\'re a little high, maybe a little too low.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could argue one way or the other, but certainly, they and other forecasters are in the right ballpark in terms of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a significant impact on the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why defer to Congress?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is almost certainly going to go down to February 28th, and the White House is going to have to engage then.\xc2\xa0 Why not now try to nip this in the bud and take the uncertainty off the table?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Jay is welcome to add to this too, but the President is looking for the best way forward.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress is an interest in doing something more like the regular order, something more like the budget process.\xc2\xa0 And this would buy them time to do precisely what both parties in Congress say is the best way to deal with all of this.</p>\n<p>I think if anyone here thought that inviting everyone up here this afternoon and locking them in a room would walk out with an agreement and solve this, of course, people would do whatever course it is.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d say we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard really from both parties that getting back, as I said, something more like regular order is the best way forward.\xc2\xa0 And the President is just trying to help foster that process which they\xe2\x80\x99ve said is the best way to move this forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you buy several months here and you fail to reach the agreement in that period of time, do you then have an even shorter period of time to implement the same magnitude of cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 It would depend on the nature of the deal.\xc2\xa0 But I would imagine that we would be at a smaller size from the $85 billion and a smaller period of time to implement.\xc2\xa0 So the notion here is to delay these very severe impacts that I\'ve described, so that you have time to work out a deal that can delay and avoid them more permanently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you don\'t, you have then an even more serious problem?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that you\'d know that it\'s more serious, depending on how the numbers go with the dollar decrease and the months.\xc2\xa0 But you\'d still have a serious issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, you talked about replacing the sequester with something bigger and better.\xc2\xa0 Just to get straight the order of magnitude that you\'re talking about -- if $4 trillion over 10 years is the goal, $2.5 trillion have been done, does that mean you simply need to replace the $1.2 trillion in the sequester, add a couple of hundred billion more, and you\'re basically at the goal?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s what the President has said, that ideally what the next phase would be, would be about a trillion and a half.\xc2\xa0 That includes interest associated with it.\xc2\xa0 And when you said $1.2 trillion for the sequester, that also -- that number for the sequester is the programmatic cuts plus interest.\xc2\xa0 And that is the type of magnitude he\'d like to do.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\'s not just the magnitude.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also the timing of it, the balance of it, and the fact that you\'re accomplishing it with real reforms rather than just crude across the board.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it your view that that trillion and a half should be 50/50 revenues and --</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The President just said it should be balanced.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the final offer he had on the table to Speaker Boehner was one that if you just did -- was 50/50 at the time.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve enacted about half of the tax portion of that and almost none of the spending portion of that.\xc2\xa0 And so on a going forward basis, it would have a different ratio than when he originally proposed it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Danny, the way the law is written, if there\'s no deal on March 2nd, do you have to start making cuts right away?\xc2\xa0 Or can agencies sort of hope there will be a deal and just not -- and just delay making cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\'t advise that they rely on hope.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 They need to execute plans that protect their mission.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned, the legal requirement would be that when we get to September 30th, the end of the fiscal year, they will have to across government have spent $85 billion less.\xc2\xa0 And every agency is going to have to approach that differently.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if we have the sequester order, we will be working with agencies to making sure that they\'re doing prudent things to meet that legal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, as outlined, those prudent things will help protect their mission as much as possible.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, their mission will be compromised for the reasons which I outlined earlier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In your view, what sort of impact are we looking at for U.S. government civilian operations overseas, aside from the military?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, there are -- we can work with the State Department and get you more specific answers as an example.\xc2\xa0 But there are civilian personnel, both at the Defense Department, at the State Department and other agencies around government that will be impacted.\xc2\xa0 Because, as I said, unless it\'s exempted -- and there are certain activities, for example, VA, is explicitly exempted -- unless it\'s exempted, you\'re taking a cut in every segment of the organization.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent the organization has an international presence, then they will be taking cuts in that way, too.</p>\n<p>And so I think probably more prudent to defer your question, in terms of more specifics, to an agency like the State Department or the Pentagon so they can give you more color to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what degree would DOD be able to use transfer authority or reprogrammings to offset sequester and protect key programs and contracts?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 So there is the -- one of the things that we\'ve advised agencies, in terms of taking those prudent steps, is looking at ways in which they can manage through the sequester in the best possible way, again, under the guiding principle of protect mission first.\xc2\xa0 One of those tools they will have is a reprogram authority, where they can go back to Congress and potentially move money from account to account.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we\'ve looked at this very closely, and Secretary Panetta is going to say it much better than I can -- with all the tools that they have, that will not get them in any way, shape or form in a place where they can tolerate the sequester safely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It won\'t eliminate sequester, but do you think it will make a big difference in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. WERFEL:\xc2\xa0 No, I do not think it will make a big difference.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if you\'ve been able to calculate what kind of impact, just on certainty of this, has already had on the business community.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a precise quantification of that.\xc2\xa0 And I would just give the same example I gave before, which is, I think most of the observers of the first fourth-quarter GDP number thought that one thing that played a role in that was uncertainty about future defense spending levels, which led to some -- appeared to have led to some reduction in defense spending then, which adversely affected GDP.</p>\n<p>So we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the magnitude, but we do know the sign.\xc2\xa0 And the sign is unambiguously negative.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one for these guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we interpret the President\'s statement earlier this week where he says that any short-term bill should have revenue attached as a veto threat on a two- or three-month bill that was cuts only?\xc2\xa0 Because there are a lot of Republicans who think that the White House is effectively bluffing, and if they were presented with a two- or three-month cuts-only bill, that he would sign it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I would just point you to what the President said and what I have said, and that is that balance has to be part of our approach to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And that applies to a short-term buy-down of the sequester, and it certainly applies to our approach to broader deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>The President is extremely serious about this, because the consequences -- I mean, the alternative that you\'re suggesting and has been floated by Republican leaders is that you would ask the burden of further deficit reduction to be borne solely by seniors through significant proposed cuts in Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid; families who have children with disabilities; middle-class families who depend on other programs, and then say, but we will hold harmless wealthy individuals and corporations who enjoy substantial benefits through loopholes and other special interest aspects of our tax code.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s simply unacceptable to this President.\xc2\xa0 It\'s unacceptable, overwhelmingly, to the American people.\xc2\xa0 You would be saying that we can\'t ask folks who enjoy a benefit in the tax code for their corporate jets to give a little bit, but we should raise the eligibility age Medicare to 67.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a tough sell I think for anybody, even in some of the reddest of districts in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in a two- or three-month bill you could easily --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- put more of the President\xe2\x80\x99s own cuts in a package\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you want to negotiate on behalf of the Congress on this, that would be great.\xc2\xa0 But the balance is essential.\xc2\xa0 It is essential because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to go economically.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to go for the middle class, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the way this President insists we move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s no balance in the sequester -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no revenue in the sequester.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go back -- the mandate from Congress was to reduce the deficit by an additional $1.2 trillion.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of folks in the Republican Party, as well as their supporters on op-ed pages, who have translated that to mean spending cuts only.\xc2\xa0 That is not what the law said.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- all I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the President says, and it is his position -- it is a position he held throughout this process -- that balance is how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to approach it.</p>\n<p>And at different times -- and their positions as strategy go are ever-changing.\xc2\xa0 But at different times there have been embraces of, as a matter of general principle, Simpson-Bowles, for example.\xc2\xa0 But what Republicans never tell you is that they all opposed Simpson-Bowles.\xc2\xa0 Every Republican on the commission voted against it, including the Chairman of the Budget Committee -- Republican House member rather -- and they would never go along with either the revenues or the defense cuts that were in Simpson-Bowles.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the fact of the matter is balance is the absolute right way to do this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, and that\'s what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 I got about five more minutes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about the storm -- what the President is doing to debrief --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can give you a little update on the storm.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have week ahead later in the day.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have it for you now.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank Danny and Jason for coming out here.</p>\n<p>FEMA is working closely with its partners, including the National Weather Service to monitor the developing winter storm in the Northeast.\xc2\xa0 FEMA\xe2\x80\x99s regional offices in Boston and New York City are in contact with state emergency management counterparts.\xc2\xa0 FEMA\xe2\x80\x99s National Watch Center here in Washington continues to monitor the situation and hold regular operational briefings with regional and federal partners as the severe winter weather advances and as impacts are felt throughout -- through the overnight hours into Saturday.</p>\n<p>The President will obviously be updated on this regularly.\xc2\xa0 FEMA liaisons are working directly with our state partners at state emergency operation centers in the Northeast states including Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York -- both in Albany and New York City -- Rhode Island and Vermont.\xc2\xa0 These liaisons are in addition to the joint state and federal field office staff who are already in place to support ongoing disaster recovery efforts in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can refer you for more information -- at least to the American people in affected areas before and after storms -- to visit <a href="http://www.ready.gov">www.ready.gov</a>.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s our update.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to any of the governors or state officials in the affected areas?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can we expect the sequester to be a large part of the State of the Union address?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no previews to give to you on the State of the Union address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ever?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you one Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the decision not to send arms to Syrian rebels?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What question are you asking?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why the White House overrode recommendations from others in the administration to arm Syrian rebels.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I am not going to get into internal deliberations about policy decisions of that nature, but I can tell you that, as the President and his national security team have looked at these issues, we have had to be very careful.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want any weapons to fall into the wrong hands and potentially further endanger the Syrian people, our ally, Israel, or the United States.\xc2\xa0 We also need to make sure that any support we are providing actually makes a difference in pressuring Assad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s widely viewed that more weapons in Syria -- that a lack of weapons is not the problem in Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind that there is no shortage, as I just said, of weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve focused our efforts on helping the opposition to become stronger, more cohesive, and more organized.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, as a general principle, this is not the kind of thing around which there is one discussion.\xc2\xa0 We almost constantly or continually review what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with regards to Syria and that conversation continues.\xc2\xa0 But it is, of course, of paramount interest on this matter in particular that we not create a situation where weapons provided by the United States end up in the wrong hands and we thereby accidentally, if you will, create more danger for the United States, for the Syrian people, or for Israel.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House surprised that yesterday John Brennan would not say that waterboarding was torture when --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thought John Brennan did an excellent job yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s how people in this building feel.\xc2\xa0 He demonstrated the breadth and depth of his experience in the field of intelligence and counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 He provided I think what has been called by others one of the most expansive discussions of some of the very serious matters that we have undertaken in our effort to fight al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was -- the public interest was greatly served by that hearing yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you surprised that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that waterboarding was torture?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think John Brennan answered the questions in depth on a number of subjects, so I would just point you to the answers he gave.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 Dan Lothian.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President going to the funeral of the young girl in Chicago that the First Lady is going to?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the First Lady is going to the funeral of a girl who was killed in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 So are, I believe, a few other officials from the administration.\xc2\xa0 I think that represents the feeling that the President and the First Lady both have about what happened to her and the tragedy that it represents both in real concrete terms to her family but also symbolically because of the tragedy of gun violence that our country has to deal with all too often.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a week ahead for you later this afternoon.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:22 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
