Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:15 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Now, I understand there are some political contests going on tonight, but I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d start the day off by taking a few questions, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will not be political in nature.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Before I do, I want to make a few announcements about some steps we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to help responsible homeowners who\xe2\x80\x99ve been struggling through this housing crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve clearly seen some positive economic news over the last few months.\xc2\xa0 Businesses have created about 3.7 million new jobs over the last two years.\xc2\xa0 Manufacturers are hiring for the first time since the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 The auto industry is back and hiring more than 200,000 people over the last few years.\xc2\xa0 Confidence is up. And the economy is getting stronger.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are still millions of Americans who can\xe2\x80\x99t find a job.\xc2\xa0 There are millions more who are having a tough time making the rent or the mortgage, paying for gas or groceries.\xc2\xa0 So our job in Washington isn\xe2\x80\x99t to sit back and do nothing.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not to stand in the way of this recovery.\xc2\xa0 Right now we\'ve got to do everything we can to speed it up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, Congress did the right thing when they passed part of my jobs plan and prevented a tax hike on 160 million working Americans this year.\xc2\xa0 And that was a good first step.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t just stop there and wait for the next election to come around.\xc2\xa0 There are a few things they can do right now that could make a real difference in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis Congress should, once and for all, end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas, and use that money to reward companies that are creating jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a proposal that does just that, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why Congress can\'t come together and start acting on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis Congress could hold a vote on the Buffett Rule so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just common sense.\xc2\xa0 The vast majority of Americans believe it\xe2\x80\x99s common sense.\xc2\xa0 And if we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about paying down our deficit, it\xe2\x80\x99s as good a place to start as any.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd finally, this Congress should pass my proposal to give every responsible homeowner a chance to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage at historically low rates. No red tape.\xc2\xa0 No runaround from the banks.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on time on your payments, if you\'ve done the right thing, if you\'ve acted responsibly, you should have a chance to save that money on your home -- perhaps to build up your equity, or just to have more money in your pocket that you can spend on businesses in your community.\xc2\xa0 That would make a huge difference for millions of American families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, if Congress refuses to act, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do everything in my power to act without them.\xc2\xa0 Last fall, we announced an initiative that allows millions of responsible homeowners to refinance at low interest rates.\xc2\xa0 Today we\'re taking it a step further -- we are cutting by more than half the refinancing fees that families pay for loans ensured by the Federal Housing Administration.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to save the typical family in that situation an extra $1,000 a year, on top of the savings that they\'d also receive from refinancing.\xc2\xa0 That would make refinancing even more attractive to more families.\xc2\xa0 It\'s like another tax cut that will put more money in people\'s pockets.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to do this on our own.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t need congressional authorization to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re also taking a series of steps to help homeowners who have served our country.\xc2\xa0 It is unconscionable that members of our armed forces and their families have been some of those who have been most susceptible to losing their homes due to the actions of unscrupulous banks and mortgage lenders.\xc2\xa0 Over the last few years that happened -- a lot.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as part of the landmark settlement we reached with some of the nation\'s largest banks a few weeks ago, here\'s what we\'re going to do:\xc2\xa0 If you are a member of the armed forces whose home was wrongfully foreclosed, you will be substantially compensated for what the bank did to you and your family.\xc2\xa0 If you are a member of the armed forces with a high interest rate who was wrongfully denied the chance to lower it while you were in active serve, which banks are required to do by law, the banks will refund you the money you would have saved along with a significant penalty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe settlement will make sure that you aren\'t forced into foreclosure just because you have a permanent change in station but can\'t sell your home because you owe more than it\'s worth.\xc2\xa0 Some of the money will also go into a fund that guarantees loans on favorable terms to our veterans, and there will be more foreclosure protections for every man and woman who is currently serving this country in harm\'s way.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I\'ve said before, no amount of money is going to be enough to make it right for a family who has had their piece of the American Dream wrongfully taken away from them, and no action -- no matter how meaningful -- will entirely heal our housing market on its own.\xc2\xa0 This is not something the government by itself can solve.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not one of those people who believe that we should just sit by and wait for the housing market to hit bottom.\xc2\xa0 There are real things that we can do right now that would make a substantial difference in the lives of innocent, responsible homeowners.\xc2\xa0 That\'s true in housing, and that\'s true in any number of different areas when it comes to ensuring that this recovery touches as many lives as possible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to be my top priority as long as I hold this office, and I will do everything I can to make that progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that I\'m going to take some questions, and I will start with Mike Viqueira.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 On the Middle East and as it relates to American politics, a little less than a year ago Moammar Qaddafi gave a speech, and he said he was going to send his forces to Benghazi, he was going to rout opponents from their bedrooms and he was going to shoot them.\xc2\xa0 You frequently cited that speech as a justification for NATO, the no-fly zone and military action against Libya.\xc2\xa0 In Syria, Bashar al Assad is killing people.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a massacre underway.\xc2\xa0 And your critics here in the United States, including, most notably, John McCain, said you should start air strikes now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd on Iran, Mitt Romney, on Sunday, went so far as to say that if you are re-elected, Iran will get a bomb and the world will change.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to those criticisms?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 All right, Mike, you\'ve asked a couple of questions there, so let me -- let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the Iran situation since that\xe2\x80\x99s been the topic in the news for the last few days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I came into office, Iran was unified, on the move, had made substantial progress on its nuclear program, and the world was divided in terms of how to deal with it.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to do over the last three years is mobilize unprecedented, crippling sanctions on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Iran is feeling the bite of these sanctions in a substantial way.\xc2\xa0 The world is unified; Iran is politically isolated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what I have said is, is that we will not countenance Iran getting a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 My policy is not containment; my policy is to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon -- because if they get a nuclear weapon that could trigger an arms race in the region, it would undermine our non-proliferation goals, it could potentially fall into the hands of terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in close consultation with all our allies, including Israel, in moving this strategy forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt this stage, it is my belief that we have a window of opportunity where this can still be resolved diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not just my view.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the view of our top intelligence officials; it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of top Israeli intelligence officials.\xc2\xa0 And, as a consequence, we are going to continue to apply the pressure even as we provide a door for the Iranian regime to walk through where they could rejoin the community of nations by giving assurances to the international community that they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting their obligations and they are not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s my track record.\xc2\xa0 Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s said on the campaign trail -- those folks don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 And when I see the casualness with which some of these folks talk about war, I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of the costs involved in war.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded that the decision that I have to make in terms of sending our young men and women into battle, and the impacts that has on their lives, the impact it has on our national security, the impact it has on our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not a game.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing casual about it.\xc2\xa0 And when I see some of these folks who have a lot of bluster and a lot of big talk, but when you actually ask them specifically what they would do, it turns out they repeat the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing over the last three years, it indicates to me that that\xe2\x80\x99s more about politics than actually trying to solve a difficult problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the one thing that we have not done is we haven\xe2\x80\x99t launched a war.\xc2\xa0 If some of these folks think that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to launch a war, they should say so.\xc2\xa0 And they should explain to the American people exactly why they would do that and what the consequences would be.\xc2\xa0 Everything else is just talk.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That goes to Syria as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 With respect to Syria, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria is heartbreaking and outrageous, and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is the international community mobilize against the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of when Assad leaves -- or if Assad leaves -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of when.\xc2\xa0 He has lost the legitimacy of his people.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that he\'s now taking against his own people is inexcusable, and the world community has said so in a more or less unified voice.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, for us to take military action unilaterally, as some have suggested, or to think that somehow there is some simple solution, I think is a mistake.\xc2\xa0 What happened in Libya was we mobilized the international community, had a U.N. Security Council mandate, had the full cooperation of the region, Arab states, and we knew that we could execute very effectively in a relatively short period of time.\xc2\xa0 This is a much more complicated situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we\'ve done is to work with key Arab states, key international partners -- Hillary Clinton was in Tunisia -- to come together and to mobilize and plan how do we support the opposition; how do we provide humanitarian assistance; how do we continue the political isolation; how do we continue the economic isolation.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to continue to work on this project with other countries.\xc2\xa0 And it is my belief that, ultimately, this dictator will fall, as dictators in the past have fallen.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the notion that the way to solve every one of these problems is to deploy our military, that hasn\'t been true in the past and it won\'t be true now.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got to think through what we do through the lens of what\'s going to be effective, but also what\'s critical for U.S. security interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake Tapper.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 What kind of assurances did you give Prime Minister Netanyahu about the role that the U.S. would play if diplomacy and economic sanctions fail to work to convince Iran\'s leaders to change their behavior, and Israel goes ahead and prepares to strike a nuclear facility?\xc2\xa0 What kind of assurances did you tell him?\xc2\xa0 And shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we -- I recognize the difference between debate and bluster -- but shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be having in this country a vigorous debate about what could happen in the case of a Middle East war in a way that, sadly, we did not do before going into Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\'s no doubt that those who are suggesting, or proposing, or beating the drums of war should explain clearly to the American people what they think the costs and benefits would be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m not one of those people -- because what I\'ve said is, is that we have a window through which we can resolve this issue peacefully.\xc2\xa0 We have put forward an international framework that is applying unprecedented pressure.\xc2\xa0 The Iranians just stated that they are willing to return to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve got the opportunity, even as we maintain that pressure, to see how it plays out.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m not going to go into the details of my conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 But what I said publicly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t differ greatly from what I said privately.\xc2\xa0 Israel is a sovereign nation that has to make its own decisions about how best to preserve its security.\xc2\xa0 And as I said over the last several days, I am deeply mindful of the historical precedents that weigh on any Prime Minister of Israel when they think about the potential threats to Israel and the Jewish homeland.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I\'ve also said is that because sanctions are starting to have significant effect inside of Iran -- and that\'s not just my assessment, that\'s, I think, a uniform assessment -- because the sanctions are going to be even tougher in the coming months, because they\'re now starting to affect their oil industry, their central bank, and because we\'re now seeing noises about them returning to the negotiating table, that it is deeply in everybody\'s interests -- the United States, Israel and the world\'s -- to see if this can be resolved in a peaceful fashion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so this notion that somehow we have a choice to make in the next week or two weeks, or month or two months, is not borne out by the facts.\xc2\xa0 And the argument that we\'ve made to the Israelis is that we have made an unprecedented commitment to their security.\xc2\xa0 There is an unbreakable bond between our two countries, but one of the functions of friends is to make sure that we provide honest and unvarnished advice in terms of what is the best approach to achieve a common goal -- particularly one in which we have a stake.\xc2\xa0 This is not just an issue of Israeli interest; this is an issue of U.S. interests.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also not just an issue of consequences for Israel if action is taken prematurely.\xc2\xa0 There are consequences to the United States as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I do think that any time we consider military action that the American people understand there\'s going to be a price to pay.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes it\'s necessary.\xc2\xa0 But we don\'t do it casually.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I visit Walter Reed, when I sign letters to families that haven\'t -- whose loved ones have not come home, I am reminded that there is a cost.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes we bear that cost.\xc2\xa0 But we think it through.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t play politics with it.\xc2\xa0 When we have in the past -- when we haven\'t thought it through and it gets wrapped up in politics, we make mistakes.\xc2\xa0 And typically, it\'s not the folks who are popping off who pay the price.\xc2\xa0 It\'s these incredible men and women in uniform and their families who pay the price.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as a consequence, I think it\'s very important for us to take a careful, thoughtful, sober approach to what is a real problem.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'ve been doing over the last three years.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I intend to keep doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sir, I\'m sorry, if I could just quickly follow up -- you didn\'t --</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Jake --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You might not be beating the drums of war, but you did very publicly say, we\'ve got Israel\'s back.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 What it means is, is that, historically, we have always cooperated with Israel with respect to the defense of Israel, just like we do with a whole range of other allies -- just like we do with Great Britain, just like we do with Japan.\xc2\xa0 And that broad statement I think is confirmed when you look at what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done over the last three years on things like Iron Dome that prevents missiles from raining down on their small towns along border regions of Israel, that potentially land on schools or children or families.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue that unprecedented security -- security commitment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was not a military doctrine that we were laying out for any particular military action.\xc2\xa0 It was a restatement of our consistent position that the security of Israel is something I deeply care about, and that the deeds of my administration over the last three years confirms how deeply we care about it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>\n\tJackie.\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s Jackie?\xc2\xa0 There you are.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the news this morning that the U.S. and its allies are returning to the table, are taking up Iran\xe2\x80\x99s offer to talk again, more than a year after those talks broke up in frustration, is this Israel\xe2\x80\x99s -- Iran\xe2\x80\x99s last chance to negotiate an end to this nuclear question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd you said three years ago -- nearly three years ago, in a similar one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, that the time for talk -- by the end of that year, 2009, you would be considering whether Iran was negotiating in good faith.\xc2\xa0 And you said at that time that \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have talks forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So here we are nearly three years later.\xc2\xa0 Is this it?\xc2\xa0 And did you think you would be here three years after those first talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You know, there is no doubt that over the last three years when Iran has engaged in negotiations there has been hemming and hawing and stalling and avoiding the issues in ways that the international community has concluded were not serious.\xc2\xa0 And my expectations, given the consequences of inaction for them, the severe sanctions that are now being applied, the huge toll it\xe2\x80\x99s taking on their economy, the degree of isolation that they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling right now -- which is unprecedented -- they understand that the world community means business.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTo resolve this issue will require Iran to come to the table and discuss in a clear and forthright way how to prove to the international community that the intentions of their nuclear program are peaceful.\xc2\xa0 They know how to do that.\xc2\xa0 This is not a mystery.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very important to make sure that, on an issue like this -- there are complexities; it obviously has to be methodical.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a breakthrough in a first meeting, but I think we will have a pretty good sense fairly quickly as to how serious they are about resolving the issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are steps that they can take that would send a signal to the international community and that are verifiable, that would allow them to be in compliance with international norms, in compliance with international mandates, abiding by the non-proliferation treaty, and provide the world an assurance that they\xe2\x80\x99re not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 They know how to do it, and the question is going to be whether in these discussions they show themselves moving clearly in that direction.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd Henry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on Israel and Iran because you have said repeatedly you have Israel\xe2\x80\x99s back.\xc2\xa0 And so I wonder why, three years in office, you have not visited Israel as President.\xc2\xa0 And related to Iran and Israel, you have expressed concern about this loose talk of war, as you call it, driving up gas prices further.\xc2\xa0 Your critics will say on Capitol Hill that you want gas prices to go higher because you have said before, that will wean the American people off fossil fuels, onto renewable fuels.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Ed, just from a political perspective, do you think the President of the United States going into reelection wants gas prices to go up higher?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is that -- is there anybody here who thinks that makes a lot of sense?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, here\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line with respect to gas prices.\xc2\xa0 I want gas prices lower because they hurt families; because I meet folks every day who have to drive a long way to get to work and them filling up this gas tank gets more and more painful, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a tax out of their pocketbooks, out of their paychecks, and a lot of folks are already operating on the margins right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s not good for the overall economy, because when gas prices go up, consumer spending oftentimes pulls back.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re in the midst right now of a recovery that is starting to build up steam, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to reverse it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I have also said about gas prices is that there is no silver bullet and the only way we\'re going to solve this problem over the medium and long term is with an all-of-the-above strategy that says we\'re going to increase production -- which has happened; we are going to make sure that we are conserving energy -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, which will save consumers about $1.7 trillion and take about 12 billion barrels of oil offline, which will help to reduce prices -- and we\'re going develop clean energy technologies that allow us to continue to use less oil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'ve made progress.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the good news is, 2010, first time in a decade that our oil imports were actually below 50 percent, and they have kept on going down.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to keep on looking at every strategy we can to, yes, reduce the amount of oil that we use, while maintaining our living standards and maintaining our productivity and maintaining our economic growth, and we\'re going to do everything we can to make sure that consumers aren\'t hurt by it.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, there are some short-term steps that we\'re looking at with respect to -- for example, there are certain potential bottlenecks in refineries around the country that we\'ve been concerned about.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned about what\'s happening in terms of production around the world.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not just what\'s happening in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve had, for example, in Sudan, some oil that\xe2\x80\x99s been taken offline that\xe2\x80\x99s helping to restrict supply.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re going to look at a whole range of measures -- including, by the way, making sure that my Attorney General is paying attention to potential speculation in the oil markets.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve asked him to reconstitute a task force that\xe2\x80\x99s examining that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we go through this every year.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve gone through this for 30 years.\xc2\xa0 And if we are going to be competitive, successful, and make sure families are protected over the long term, then we\'ve got to make sure that we\'ve got a set of options that reduce our overall dependence on oil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with respect to Israel, I am not the first President who has been unable, because of a whole range of issues, not to visit Israel as President in their first term.\xc2\xa0 I visited Israel twice as senator, once right before I became President.\xc2\xa0 The measure of my commitment to Israel is not measured by a single visit.\xc2\xa0 The measure of my commitment to Israel is seen in the actions that I\'ve taken as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it is indisputable that I\'ve had Israel\'s back over the last three years.</p>\n<p>\n\tAamer Madhani.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe Rush Limbaugh\'s apology to the Georgetown law student was sufficient and heartfelt?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with the decision of the growing number of sponsors that have decided to drop his show or stop supporting his show?\xc2\xa0 And has there been a double standard on this issue?\xc2\xa0 Liberal commentators have made similarly provocative or distasteful statements and there hasn\'t been such an outrage.</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to comment on what sponsors decide to do.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to comment on either the economics or the politics of it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what\'s in Rush Limbaugh\'s heart, so I\'m not going to comment on the sincerity of his apology.\xc2\xa0 What I can comment on is the fact that all decent folks can agree that the remarks that were made don\'t have any place in the public discourse.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason I called Ms. Fluke is because I thought about Malia and Sasha, and one of the things I want them to do as they get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree with them on.\xc2\xa0 I want them to be able to speak their mind in a civil and thoughtful way.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want them attacked or called horrible names because they\'re being good citizens.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted Sandra to know that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and there\'s a way to do it that doesn\'t involve you being demeaned and insulted, particularly when you\xe2\x80\x99re a private citizen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJessica Yellin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill Mahr apologized for what he said about -- (inaudible) -- should apologize for what they said about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Top Democrats have said that Republicans on a similar issue are engaged in a war on women.\xc2\xa0 Some top Republicans say it\xe2\x80\x99s more like Democrats are engaged in a war for the women\xe2\x80\x99s vote.\xc2\xa0 As you talk about loose talk of war in another arena and women are -- this could raise concerns among women, do you agree with the chair of your Democratic National Committee that there is a war on women?<br/>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Here is what I think.\xc2\xa0 Women are going to make up their own mind in this election about who is advancing the issues that they care most deeply about.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned being married to Michelle is I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell her what it is that she thinks is important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are millions of strong women around the country who are going to make their own determination about a whole range of issues.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be narrowly focused just on contraception.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be driven by one statement by one radio announcer.\xc2\xa0 It is going to be driven by their view of what\xe2\x80\x99s most likely to make sure they can help support their families, make their mortgage payments; who\'s got a plan to ensure that middle-class families are secure over the long term; what\xe2\x80\x99s most likely to result in their kids being able to get the education they need to compete.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I believe that Democrats have a better story to tell to women about how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solidify the middle class and grow this economy, make sure everybody has a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, and we got a fair set of rules of the road that everybody has to follow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not somebody who believes that women are going to be single-issue voters.\xc2\xa0 They never have been.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong story to tell when it comes to women.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you prefer this language be changed?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Jessica, as you know, if I start being in the business of arbitrating --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talk about civility.</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 And what I do is I practice it.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to lead by example in this situation, as opposed to commenting on every single comment that\xe2\x80\x99s made by either politicians or pundits.\xc2\xa0 I would be very busy.\xc2\xa0 I would not have time to do my job.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s your job, to comment on what\'s said by politicians and pundits.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Lori Montenegro.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 There you go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, polls are showing that Latino voters seem to be favoring your reelection over a Republican alternative.\xc2\xa0 Yet some of them are still disappointed, others have said, about a promise that you\'ve made on immigration reform that has yet to come to pass.\xc2\xa0 If you are reelected, what would be your strategy, what would you do different to get immigration reform passed through the Congress, especially if both houses continue as they are right now, which is split?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, just substantively, every American should want immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got a system that\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got a system in which you have millions of families here in this country who are living in the shadows, worried about deportation.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got American workers that are being undercut because those undocumented workers can be hired and the minimum wage laws may not be observed, overtime laws may not be observed.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'ve got incredibly talented people who want to start businesses in this country or to work in this country, and we should want those folks here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 But right now, the legal immigration system is so tangled up that it becomes very difficult for them to put down roots here.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we can be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 And it is not just a Hispanic issue -- this is an issue for everybody.\xc2\xa0 This is an American issue that we need to fix.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, when I came into office I said I am going to push to get this done.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it done.\xc2\xa0 And the reason we haven\'t gotten it done is because what used to be a bipartisan agreement that we should fix this ended up becoming a partisan issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI give a lot of credit to my predecessor, George Bush, and his political advisors who said this should not be just something the Democrats support; the Republican Party is invested in this as well.\xc2\xa0 That was good advice then; it would be good advice now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd my hope is, is that after this election, the Latino community will have sent a strong message that they want a bipartisan effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform that involves making sure we\xe2\x80\x99ve got tough border security -- and this administration has done more for border security than just about anybody -- that we are making sure that companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to take advantage of undocumented workers; that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got strong laws in place; and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a path so that all those folks whose kids often are U.S. citizens, who are working with us, living with us and in our communities, and not breaking the law, and trying to do their best to raise their families, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a chance to be a fuller part of our community.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, what do I think will change?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would you do differently?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 What I will do -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be putting forward, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve done before, a framework, a proposal, legislation that can move it -- move the ball forward and actually get this thing done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately, I can\xe2\x80\x99t vote for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to come to the conclusion that this is good for the country and that this is something that they themselves think is important.\xc2\xa0 And depending on how Congress turns out, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how many Republican votes we need to get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Today is Super Tuesday, so I wonder if you might weigh in on some of your potential Republican opponents.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney has criticized you on Iran and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHope is not a foreign policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He also said that you are \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s most feckless President since Carter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What would you like to say to Mr. Romney?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Good luck tonight.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, really.</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Really.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tLynn, since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been hollering and you\xe2\x80\x99re from my hometown, make it a good one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is about the switch of the G8 summit from Chicago to Camp David.\xc2\xa0 A reason given from the White House is that now you wanted a more intimate summit.\xc2\xa0 People of Chicago would like to know what do you know now that you did not know when you booked hometown Chicago for the G8 that led to the switch?\xc2\xa0 And what role did security threats possibly play in the decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, keep in mind, Lynn, we\xe2\x80\x99re still going to be showing up with a whole bunch of world leaders.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got this NATO summit.\xc2\xa0 Typically what\xe2\x80\x99s happened is, is that we try to attach the G8 summit to the NATO summit so that the leaders in the G8 summit don\'t have to travel twice to whatever location.\xc2\xa0 So last year, in France, we combined a G8 with a NATO summit.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do so again.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have to say, this was an idea that was brought to me after the initial organizing of the NATO summit.\xc2\xa0 Somebody pointed out that I hadn\'t had any of my counterparts, who I\'ve worked with now for three years, up to Camp David.\xc2\xa0 G8 tends to be a more informal setting in which we talk about a wide range of issues in a pretty intimate way.\xc2\xa0 And the thinking was that people would enjoy being in a more casual backdrop.\xc2\xa0 I think the weather should be good that time of year.\xc2\xa0 It will give me a chance to spend time with Mr. Putin, the new Russian President.\xc2\xa0 And from there, we will then fly to Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tI always have confidence in Chicago being able to handle security issues.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\'s Taste of Chicago or Lollapalooza\xc2\xa0 -- (laughter) -- or Bull\'s championships, we know how to deal with a crowd.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that your new mayor will be quite attentive to detail in making sure that everything goes off well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, last one, last question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, just to continue on that -- when the NATO leaders gather in Chicago in May, do you expect that they\'ll be able to agree on a transition strategy?\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned at all that the Koran burning and the episodes that have followed since then threaten your ability to negotiate with partners?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, keep in mind that the transition policy was in place and established at Lisbon, and we\'ve been following that strategy that calls for us turning over increasing responsibility to Afghans and a full transition so that our combat role is over by the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 And our coalition partners have agreed to it.\xc2\xa0 They are sticking with it.\xc2\xa0 That continues to be the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we are now going to be doing over the next -- at this NATO meeting and planning for the next two years, is to make sure that that transition is not a cliff, but that there are benchmarks and steps that are taken along the way, in the same way that we reduced our role in Iraq so that it is gradual, Afghan capacity is built, the partnering with Afghan security forces is effective, that we are putting in place the kinds of support structures that are needed in order for the overall strategy to be effective.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, yes, the situation with the Koran burning concerns me. I think that it is an indication of the challenges in that environment, and it\'s an indication that now is the time for us to transition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the violence directed at our people is unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And President Karzai acknowledged that.\xc2\xa0 But what is also true is President Karzai I think is eager for more responsibility on the Afghan side.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to be able to find a mechanism whereby Afghans understand their sovereignty is being respected and that they\'re going to be taking a greater and greater role in their own security.\xc2\xa0 That I think is in the interest of Afghans.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also in our interests.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident we can execute, but it\'s not going to be a smooth path. There are going to be bumps along the road just as there were in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, are these bumps along the road, or are you seeing a deterioration in the relationship, based on the Koran burning itself, the violence that has followed, that inhibits your ability to work out things like how to hand off the detention center?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- none of this stuff is easy, and it never has been.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, the most recent riots or protests against the Koran burning were tragic, but remember, this happened a while back when a pastor in Florida threatened to burn a Koran.\xc2\xa0 In Iraq, as we were making this transition, there were constant crises that would pop up and tragic events that would take place and there would be occasional setbacks.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what I\'ve tried to do is to set a course, make sure that up and down the chain of command everybody knows what our broader strategy is.\xc2\xa0 And one of the incredible things about our military is that when they know what our objective is, what our goal is, regardless of the obstacles that they meet along the way, they get the job done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that President Karzai understands that we are interested in a strategic partnership with the Afghan people and the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 We are not interested in staying there any longer than is necessary to assure that al Qaeda is not operating there, and that there is sufficient stability that it doesn\'t end up being a free-for-all after ISAF has left.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we share interests here.\xc2\xa0 It will require negotiations, and there will be time where things don\'t look as smooth as I\'d like.\xc2\xa0 That\'s kind of the deal internationally on a whole range of these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 Thank you guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tOh, can I just make one other comment?\xc2\xa0 I want to publicly express condolences to the family of Donald Payne, Congressman from New Jersey -- a wonderful man; did great work, both domestically and internationally.\xc2\xa0 He was a friend of mine.\xc2\xa0 And so my heart goes out to his family and to his colleagues.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:59 P.M.
