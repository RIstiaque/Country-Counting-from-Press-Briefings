EST</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us as we wrap up a rather newsy week, previewing some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals that he\'ll describe in the State of the Union address later this month.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\'re headed to Knoxville, Tennessee, right now where we\'ll be joined by the Vice President and Dr. Biden to unveil the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to make two years of community college free for all responsible students no matter their age.</p>\n<p>The President believes now is the time to make two years of college as universal as high school.\xc2\xa0 This proposal is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for how we can continue to lead the world economically in the 21st century and to help grow the middle class.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we\'re headed to Tennessee right now because Governor Haslam launched a program to provide free community college to all Tennessee students over a year ago.\xc2\xa0 In its first year, almost 90 percent of graduating high school seniors applied.\xc2\xa0 The Tennessee Promise program served as an inspiration for the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.\xc2\xa0 It demonstrates that this proposal that we\'re talking about today is both ambitious and achievable.</p>\n<p>In addition, today the President is also going to announce the American Technical Training Fund.\xc2\xa0 This fund is designed to help high-potential, low-wage workers gain the skills they need to work in fields with significant numbers of middle-class jobs such as IT, energy, and advanced manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Lastly, later today we\'re going to travel to Clinton, Tennessee, to announce the latest manufacturing hub, a series of public-private partnerships aimed at boosting advanced manufacturing, fostering innovation, and attracting well-paying jobs that will strengthen the middle class.\xc2\xa0 This is also going to be an occasion for the cynics amongst us to memorialize it -- at the end of last year, Congress came together in a bipartisan bill to pass support for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the legislation proves that strengthening American manufacturing is something that we can all agree on.</p>\n<p>With that, I\'m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Nebraska court has thrown out the Keystone case.\xc2\xa0 How quickly might we see a decision to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Nedra.\xc2\xa0 I saw the court ruling.\xc2\xa0 But our posture and our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 This is a process that is still underway at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates for you on that process.\xc2\xa0 As you know, it\'s undergoing rigorous review, and we\'re going to wait for that review to be concluded before the President makes any decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are issues that are still outstanding at this point, though?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m going to refer you to the State Department for sort of the rigorous criteria that they are looking at when evaluating this project.\xc2\xa0 That process is one that predates this administration -- it goes back decades.\xc2\xa0 It\'s part of a precedent of administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to let that process unfold in regular order.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What Josh had stressed over the last week or so was the court case in Nebraska was holding up being able to know what the route was, like that was the thing that he said was holding everything up.\xc2\xa0 So now that that\'s gone, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t things move quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\'re right, Josh did stress that.\xc2\xa0 He also stressed that this process is still housed at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have an update on the timeline for you, but you are right that now that the route has been more determined, the State Department can continue their process to evaluate it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this change the President\xe2\x80\x99s threat to veto the legislation in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It does not, sir.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the process should unfold at the State Department and that any legislative end-run around that process is misguided, and he will veto that bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President telling the State Department they should go ahead and accelerate this review to get this behind us?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, the process at the State Department is unfolding in regular order, and that\xe2\x80\x99s still ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You called it an end-run around Congress.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Congress have the power to do exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do in conjunction with the President?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean an end-run around Congress.\xc2\xa0 This would have been an end-run around the approval process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Congress have that power to pass laws?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Congress definitely has the power to pass laws.\xc2\xa0 What we believe is this is a process that predates this administration, that this is a process that is housed at the State Department, that has gone on for decades.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the regular course of business that this project should be evaluated under.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Paris right now and the extent to which the President has been updated on that, how recently, and what the United States is doing specifically to assist the French?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 The President was updated this morning. As you know, before we left the White House, he had his Presidential Daily Briefing.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that this was a topic of expansive conversation in that session.\xc2\xa0 The President has been kept up to date as the situation warrants.\xc2\xa0 I can also tell you that White House officials and administration officials from the agencies have been in touch with their French counterparts almost minute by minute as this situation unfolds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- hear what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the plane?\xc2\xa0 During this flight there seems to have been some significant developments.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you the President continues to get updates as the situation warrants.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we getting any more information about the Paris attackers themselves and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a Yemen connection?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Steve, the situation there is very fluid, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of either the situation or the French government.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to the French authorities for any information on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to -- is he watching the news coverage here on the plane, can you say?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you find out?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to try.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senators Alexander and Corker are on board today.\xc2\xa0 Does this imply some level of support for the program the President is announcing today?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you for asking.\xc2\xa0 Senators Corker, Alexander and Congressman Duncan are all on the flight with us today.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask them for their position on this.\xc2\xa0 We do appreciate the bipartisan interest in this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is something that was spearheaded by a Republican governor in Tennessee.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a similar program under Mayor Emanuel in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 So we believe -- we take Republicans at their word when they say that there\xe2\x80\x99s interest in education, and so we look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House team been talking to members of Congress about this at all?\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking to these two senators about it today?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in constant touch with Republicans and Democrats on the Hill on this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the national conversation on this starts today, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a very detailed legislative strategy to read out to you at this moment, but this is something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be working hard on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask you this other question.\xc2\xa0 This morning in a statement, Senator Alexander said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think a new federal program was necessary to support federalization of the Tennessee Promise but that he did think he would -- it sounded like he would be supportive of expanding the Pell Grant program. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what you guys have in mind, but does that seem to dovetail with what the President is thinking?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it is time to make college education the norm, and that about 100 years ago this country decided that high school would be the norm and that now is the time to make sure that all Americans, regardless of age, have access to higher education.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on, in particular because we need to make sure America\xe2\x80\x99s young people have the skills they need to succeed in a 21st century economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I do think -- I think there was a Tennessee congresswoman maybe who issued a statement yesterday who said, look, good idea, I like what happened in Tennessee, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want a one-size-fits-all, federal, top-down program, that, like, the reason it worked is because it works for Tennessee.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- I mean, this does seem like it opens the administration up to that same kind of criticism, that what they want to do is impose top-down solutions.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes the success we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Tennessee is something that should be available to all 50 states.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President wants to make this a national program, to make sure that young people, no matter if they\xe2\x80\x99re in Tennessee or any other state, have access to a higher education.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Tennessee program, students can apply for aid beyond what they would get through grants.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s intention as well, or does he intend to have this program just cover the tuition without applying for grants?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 So for details on this I\xe2\x80\x99m going to refer you to the Department of Education, but, yes -- largely, the full two years of their college education will be paid for.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s 75 percent by the federal government and the rest remaining from the states.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how would you pay for this program?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We are going to release those details in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, which will be released on time in a few weeks.\xc2\xa0 I do know that there\xe2\x80\x99s intensive interest in this since we announced it last night, which I\xe2\x80\x99m gratified by.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that over 5.7 million people viewed the video that we released last night at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xc2\xa0 As of 10:00 a.m. this morning, 5.7 million people viewed it; 21.1 million people had been reached with that Facebook post.\xc2\xa0 So we are very gratified by the interest.\xc2\xa0 I can also tell you that this was the most successful White House Facebook post ever that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 Given the interest in the cost, I wanted to let you know that it is going to be roughly $60 billion over 10 years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sixty?\xc2\xa0 6-0?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 That is a significant investment.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s one the President believes is worthwhile, because we need to make sure that America\xe2\x80\x99s young people are getting the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no better ticket to the middle class than a college education.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That $60 billion is the federal piece -- the 75 percent?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on that, would that be done as a mandatory program?\xc2\xa0 Meaning anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s eligible for it would get funding on the mandatory side of the budget?\xc2\xa0 Or is this is a discretionary program of Congress annually appropriating funds, possible fewer funds?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will have to check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you guys describe this as sort of the beginning of a conversation.\xc2\xa0 Do you see this as a fully baked program, or something that you want to discuss and could change significantly in the coming weeks and months?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will say that President has a pretty clear vision of what he wants to do, which is inspire -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been forthcoming that this has been inspired by the Tennessee program. That said, we are starting a national conversation today in just a few hours about how we can expand college access for all Americans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Putting a fine point on it, that would leave states responsible for $20 billion over 10 years?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I want to say the federal share of this will be $60 billion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 I also want to say that just a day ago Republicans seemed to shrug off their own congressional budget, finding that $53 billion would be added onto the deficit if their work week bill were to pass.\xc2\xa0 They shrugged that off; they said it didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother them.\xc2\xa0 It bothers us.</p>\n<p>And what I would like to say is that Republicans are now spending tens of billions of dollars to take health care away from a million Americans.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re spending tens of billions of dollars to make sure America\xe2\x80\x99s young people get an education.\xc2\xa0 We feel like that distinction is worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the Republican Congress would support the President\xe2\x80\x99s request for that appropriation?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, we take Republicans at their word.\xc2\xa0 I know several of them in leadership and some of the new freshmen have said that education is a priority.\xc2\xa0 So we take them at their word on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is a program that has had bipartisan support at the state and local level.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to building on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything about the report that the two brothers suspected in the Hebdo attack are dead?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, obviously the situation is very fluid.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the French authorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cuba has released 36 political prisoners.\xc2\xa0 Have they provided assurances that they will release the rest of them?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, thank you for asking the question.\xc2\xa0 We actually welcome the significant and ongoing releases of the political prisoners by the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 These releases are consistent with the cases that we raise with the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the progress.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s a tangible sign that they\xe2\x80\x99re keeping their word, and we look forward to that continuing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about -- you asked for 53.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep their word, just as they have over the past day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one thing more about the 60 over 10?\xc2\xa0 Does that index -- does it start at a lower number and become higher over time, expecting more participation and higher costs?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to double-check on this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is to say, does it start at, like, $5 billion and become $7 billion to be 60 over 10?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will double-check on that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s fixed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On jobs numbers today -- obviously good news on the one hand.\xc2\xa0 But on the other hand, wages have actually fallen, which is still sort of a sign of weakness.\xc2\xa0 What can the President do about increasing wages in addition to adding jobs to the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we tend to focus not on any particular stat from any particular month, but we look at long-term trends.\xc2\xa0 We believe the report release today caps off a year of strong economic growth, strong job numbers.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this is the highest-performing job growth year since the late 1990s.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as you point out, there\xe2\x80\x99s still more work to be done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President hit the road this week, talking about ways that we can continue to make sure this economic progress is enjoyed by as many people as possible.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a direct connection to the announcement we\xe2\x80\x99re making today to make community college more accessible for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 Because there is no better ticket to the middle class than a college education.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a week ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I do, sir.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President will welcome the 2014 NBA champions, San Antonio Spurs, to the White House to honor the team on winning their championship title.\xc2\xa0 The visit will continue the tradition begun by President Obama of honoring sports teams for their efforts to give back to their communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will host bipartisan, bicameral congressional leadership, where he will host -- where he will discuss a wide range of issues, including where he hopes he can work together to grow the economy and protect our national security.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden will also attend.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President will travel to Baltimore, Maryland, to attend a Senate Democratic Issues Conference.</p>\n<p>And on Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s done all his pre-State of the Union travel after today?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I just read you the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 If we have any more announcements on what the President is up to between now and then, we will let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how\xe2\x80\x99s the prep going on the speech?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We are making great progress.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:38 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
