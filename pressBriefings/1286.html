EDT<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Have a seat, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I just want to talk a little bit about our continuing efforts to dig ourselves out of this recession and to grow our economy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said in Cleveland on Wednesday, I ran for President because I believed the policies of the previous decade had left our economy weaker and our middle class struggling.\xc2\xa0 They were policies that cut taxes, especially for millionaires and billionaires, cut regulations for corporations and for special interests, and left everyone else pretty much fending for themselves.\xc2\xa0 They were policies that ultimately culminated in a financial crisis and a terrible recession that we\xe2\x80\x99re still digging out of today.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nWe came into office with a different view about how our economy should work.\xc2\xa0 Instead of tax cuts for millionaires, we believe in cutting taxes for middle-class families and small business owners.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0 Instead of letting corporations play by their own rules, we believe in making sure that businesses treat workers well and consumers friendly, and play by the same rules as everyone else.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place common-sense rules that accomplish that.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of tax breaks that encourage corporations to create jobs overseas, we believe in tax breaks for companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America. And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to do that.\xc2\xa0 We believe in investments that will make America more competitive in the global economy:\xc2\xa0 investments in education and clean energy, in research and technology.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re making those investments.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo these are the principles that have guided us over the last 19 months.\xc2\xa0 And these are the principles that form the basis of the additional economic proposals that I offered this week.\xc2\xa0 Because even though the economy is growing again, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve added more than 750,000 private sector jobs this year, the hole the recession left was huge and progress has been painfully slow.\xc2\xa0 Millions of Americans are still looking for work.\xc2\xa0 Millions of families are struggling to pay their bills or the mortgage.\xc2\xa0 And so these proposals are meant to both accelerate job growth in the short term and strengthen the economy in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese proposals include a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation that they do here in America.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed that all American businesses should be allowed to write off all the investments they do in 2011.\xc2\xa0 This will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in our economy. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also announced a six-year plan to rebuild America\xe2\x80\x99s roads and railways and runways.\xc2\xa0 Already our investments in infrastructure are putting folks in the construction industry back to work.\xc2\xa0 And this plan would put thousands more back to work, and it would help us remain competitive with countries in Europe and Asia that have already invested heavily in projects like high-speed railroads.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nBut one thing we can do next week is end a month-long standoff on a small business jobs bill that\xe2\x80\x99s been held up in the Senate by a partisan minority.\xc2\xa0 I realize there are plenty of issues in Washington where people of good faith simply disagree on principle.\xc2\xa0 This should not and is not one of those issues.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a bill that does two main things:\xc2\xa0 It gives small business owners tax cuts, and it helps them get loans.\xc2\xa0 It will eliminate capital gains taxes for key investments in 1 million small businesses.\xc2\xa0 It will provide incentives to invest and create jobs for 4 million small businesses.\xc2\xa0 It will more than double the amount some small business owners can borrow to grow their companies.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bill that\'s paid for, a bill that won\xe2\x80\x99t add to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 It has been written by Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bill that\'s been praised by the Chamber of Commerce.\xc2\xa0 And yet a minority of Republican senators have been using legislative tactics to prevent the bill from even getting to a vote.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I was pleased to see that yesterday, Republican Senator George Voinovich of Ohio said he would refuse to support this blockade any longer.\xc2\xa0 Senator Voinovich said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis country is really hurting,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have time anymore to play games.\xe2\x80\x9d I could not agree more.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand there\xe2\x80\x99s an election coming up.\xc2\xa0 But the American people didn\xe2\x80\x99t send us here to think about our jobs.\xc2\xa0 They sent us here to think about theirs.\xc2\xa0 And there are small businesses right now who are putting off plans to hire more workers because this bill is stalled.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of leadership this country deserves.\xc2\xa0 And I hope we can now move forward to get small business owners the relief they need to start hiring and growing again.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the subject of economics, I also want to make an announcement about my economic team. This week, Christina Romer returned to Berkeley after a tireless, outstanding tenure as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. Christy is brilliant, she is dedicated, and she was part of the team that helped save this country from a depression.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss her dearly.\xc2\xa0 But today, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to announce Austan Goolsbee as her replacement.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAustan has been one of my good friends and close economic advisors for many years.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the finest economists in the country, and he\xe2\x80\x99s worked as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers since we arrived here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not just a brilliant economist, he\xe2\x80\x99s someone who has a deep appreciation of how the economy affects everyday people, and he talks about it in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s easily understood.\xc2\xa0 He already knows and works with the rest of the team very well.\xc2\xa0 I have complete confidence he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do an outstanding job as CEA Chair.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, tomorrow we will commemorate not only the heartbreak of September 11th, but also the enduring values and resilient spirit of America.\xc2\xa0 Both Michelle and I will be joining our fellow citizens in remembering those who were lost on that day and honoring all who exhibited such extraordinary heroism in the midst of tragedy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have further remarks tomorrow, but for now let me just note that tomorrow is a National Day of Service and Remembrance and I hope each of us finds a way to serve our fellow citizens -- not only to reaffirm our deepest values as Americans, but to rekindle that spirit of unity and common purpose that we felt in the days that followed that September morning. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I\'d be happy to take some questions, and I\'m going to start with Darlene Superville of AP. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 You said this week that Democrats wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do well in the November elections if it turns out to be a referendum on the economy.\xc2\xa0 But with millions of people out of work and millions of people losing their homes, how could it not be a referendum on the economy and your handling of it, and why would you not welcome that?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, the -- what I said was that if it was just a referendum on whether we\xe2\x80\x99ve made the kind of progress that we need to, then people around the country would say we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\xc2\xa0 If the election is about the policies that are going to move us forward versus the policies that will get us back into a mess, then I think the Democrats will do very well.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s why.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I just indicated, middle-class families had been struggling for a decade, before I came into office. Their wages and incomes had flat-lined.\xc2\xa0 They were seeing the cost of everything from health care to sending their kids to college going up. Job growth was the weakest of any economic expansion between 2001 and 2008 since World War II.\xc2\xa0 The pace was slower than it\xe2\x80\x99s been over the last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo these policies of cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans, of stripping away regulations that protect consumers, running up a record surplus to a record deficit -- those policies finally culminated in the worst financial crisis we\xe2\x80\x99ve had since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And for 19 months, what we have done is steadily worked to avoid a depression, to take an economy that was contracting rapidly and making it grow again; a situation where we were losing 750,000 jobs a month, and now we\xe2\x80\x99ve had eight consecutive months of private sector job growth; and made investments that are going to strengthen the economy over the long term.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\xc2\xa0 We lost 4 million jobs in the six months before I was sworn in, and we lost 8 million jobs total during the course of this recession.\xc2\xa0 That is a huge hole to dig ourselves out of.\xc2\xa0 And people who have lost their jobs around the country and can\xe2\x80\x99t find one, moms who are sending out resumes and not getting calls back, worried about losing homes and not being able to pay bills -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not feeling good right now.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I ran precisely because I did not think middle-class families in this country were getting a fair shake.\xc2\xa0 And I ran because I felt that we had to have a different economic philosophy in order to grow that middle class and grow our economy over the long term. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for all the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.\xc2\xa0 And that means that people are frustrated and that means people are angry.\xc2\xa0 And since I\xe2\x80\x99m the President and Democrats have controlled the House and the Senate, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that people are saying, what have you done.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut between now and November, what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to remind the American people of is that the policies that we have put in place have moved us in the right direction, and the policies that the Republicans are offering right now are the exact policies that got us into this mess.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a situation where they went and reflected, and said to themselves, you know what, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do some things right and so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a whole bunch of new ideas out here that we want to present to you that we think are going to help put us on the path of strong growth -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not what happens.\xc2\xa0 The chairman of their committee has said, we would do the exact same things as we did before Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 Well, we know where that led.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a perfect example is the debate we\xe2\x80\x99re having on taxes right now.\xc2\xa0 I have said that middle-class families need tax relief right now.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to work on a bill and sign a bill this month that would ensure that middle-class families get tax relief.\xc2\xa0 Ninety-seven percent of Americans make less than $250,000 a year -- $250,000 a year or less.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m saying we can give those families -- 97 percent permanent tax relief.\xc2\xa0 And by the way, for those who make more than $250,000, they\xe2\x80\x99d still get tax relief on the first $250,000; they just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it for income above that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that seems like a common-sense thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got is the Republicans holding middle-class tax relief hostage because they\'re insisting we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give tax relief to millionaires and billionaires to the tune of about $100,000 per millionaire, which would cost over the course of 10 years, $700 billion, and that economists say is probably the worst way to stimulate the economy.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense, and that\'s an example of what this election is all about.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want the same kinds of skewed policies that led us to this crisis, then the Republicans are ready to offer that.\xc2\xa0 But if you want policies that are moving us out, even though you may be frustrated, even though change isn\xe2\x80\x99t happening as fast as you\xe2\x80\x99d like, then I think Democrats are going to do fine in November.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re looking for Republican help on the economic proposals that you unveiled this week, and you also mentioned the small business bill.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re at odds with them over tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Is there room for a middle ground whereby, for example, the tax cuts on the wealthy could be extended for a period of time, and then allowed to expire?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly there is going to be room for discussion.\xc2\xa0 My hope is, is that on this small business bill that is before the Senate right now, that we actually make some progress.\xc2\xa0 I still don\'t understand why we didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass that two months ago.\xc2\xa0 As I said, this was written by Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 This is a bill that traditionally you\xe2\x80\x99d probably get 90 percent or 100 percent Republican support.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing politics for the last several months.\xc2\xa0 And if the Republican leadership is prepared to get serious about doing something for families that are hurting out there, I would love to talk to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on the high-income tax cuts, my position is let\xe2\x80\x99s get done what we all agree on.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99ve said is they agree that the middle class tax cut should be made permanent.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s work on that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\xc2\xa0 We can have a further conversation about how they want to spend an additional $700 billion to give an average of $100,000 to millionaires.\xc2\xa0 That, I think, is a bad idea.\xc2\xa0 If you were going to spend that money, there are a lot better ways of spending it. But more to the point, these are the same folks who say that they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the deficits.\xc2\xa0 Why would we borrow money on policies that won\xe2\x80\x99t help the economy and help people who don\'t need help?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut setting that aside, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an area of agreement, which is, let\xe2\x80\x99s help families out there who are having a tough time.\xc2\xa0 As I said, we could, this month, give every American certainty and tax relief up to $250,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 Every single American would benefit from that.\xc2\xa0 Now, people who make $250,000 a year or less, they\xe2\x80\x99d benefit on all their income.\xc2\xa0 People who make a million dollars would benefit on a quarter of their income.\xc2\xa0 But the point is, is that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we can all agree to.\xc2\xa0 Why hold it up?\xc2\xa0 Why hold the middle class hostage in order to do something that most economists don\xe2\x80\x99t think makes sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you ruling out a deal with Republicans on tax cuts for the wealthiest?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is let\xe2\x80\x99s do what we agreed to and that the Americans -- people overwhelmingly agreed to, which is let\xe2\x80\x99s give certainty to families out there that are having a tough time.<br/>\n<br/>\nChip Reid.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 On the economic package that you rolled out earlier this week, first on the business tax cuts. Why did you wait until this superheated campaign season to roll it out?\xc2\xa0 A lot of your critics and even some Democrats say, well, clearly he\xe2\x80\x99s just using this for political purposes, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any expectation it\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to be passed, it\xe2\x80\x99s a political weapon.\xc2\xa0 Why did you wait so long to bring that out?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the stimulus part, we can\xe2\x80\x99t get people in the White House to say it is a stimulus -- $50 billion for roads and other infrastructure, but they avoid the word \xe2\x80\x9cstimulus\xe2\x80\x9d like the plague. Is that because the original stimulus is so deeply unpopular?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why is it so unpopular?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- let me go back to when I first came into office.\xc2\xa0 We had an immediate task, which was to rescue an economy that was tipping over a cliff.\xc2\xa0 And we put in place an economic plan that 95 percent of economists say substantially helped us avoid a depression.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nA third of those were tax cuts, by the way.\xc2\xa0 A third of that economic plan was tax cuts for individuals and for small businesses.\xc2\xa0 So we haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- this notion that we waited until now to put forward a series of plans, Chip, we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- just on the small business issue alone, we have cut taxes for small businesses eight times during the course of the last 18 months.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re hardly Johnnie-come-latelys on this issue.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, when you put all the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve done together, it has made a difference.\xc2\xa0 Three million people have jobs that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them otherwise had we not taken these steps.\xc2\xa0 The economy would be in much worse shape.\xc2\xa0 But as I said before, we\xe2\x80\x99re not where we need to go yet -- which means that if we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet, what else can we do?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the proposals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward are ones that historically, again, have garnered bipartisan support:\xc2\xa0 a research and development tax credit so that companies that are investing in research here in the United States -- which is part of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep us growing and keep us innovative -- let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that companies are strongly incentivized to do that.\xc2\xa0 Making sure that their expensing accelerated business depreciation is happening in 2011, so that if companies are sort of sitting on the sidelines right now, not sure whether they should invest, let\xe2\x80\x99s give them incentive to go ahead and invest now to give that a jumpstart.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nOn infrastructure, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a highway bill that traditionally is done every six years.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying is let\xe2\x80\x99s ramp up what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, let\xe2\x80\x99s beef it up a little bit -- because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got this infrastructure all across the country that everybody from governors to mayors to economists to engineers of all political stripes have said is holding us back in terms of our long-term competitiveness -- let\xe2\x80\x99s get started now rebuilding America. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in terms of paying for some of these things, let\xe2\x80\x99s stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas, let\xe2\x80\x99s stop incentivizing that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in the United States of America. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose are all common-sense approaches.\xc2\xa0 Historically, as you know, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been around this town for a long time -- usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on infrastructure. Usually, Republicans and Democrats agree on making sure that research and development investments are made right here in the United States. And so let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has nothing to do with the notion that somehow what we did previously didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 It worked. It just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done as much as we need it to do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve still got a long ways to go and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep on doing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a second stimulus?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s how I would -- there is no doubt that everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to do -- everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to do is designed to stimulate growth and additional jobs in the economy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s our entire agenda. So I have no problem with people saying the President is trying to stimulate growth and hiring.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what I should be doing?\xc2\xa0 I would assume that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Republicans think we should do, to stimulate growth and jobs.\xc2\xa0 And I will keep on trying to stimulate growth and jobs for as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m President of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\nHans Nichols.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask my real question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now been more than two months since the financial reg reform bill has passed.\xc2\xa0 A centerpiece of that was what you talked about as a consumer financial protection bureau. And yet you haven\xe2\x80\x99t named a head.\xc2\xa0 Is Elizabeth Warren still a leading candidate?\xc2\xa0 And if not, are you worried about some sort of Senate hurdle for her confirmation?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 This is a great opportunity to talk to the American people about what I do think is going to be hugely helpful to middle-class families in the years and decades to come, and that is an agency that has been set up, an independent agency, whose sole job is to protect families in their financial transactions.\xc2\xa0 So if you are getting a credit card, we are going to have an agency that makes sure that that credit card company can\xe2\x80\x99t jack up your rates without any reason -- including on old balances.\xc2\xa0 And that could save American consumers tens of billions of dollars just in the first couple of years.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are out there looking for a mortgage -- and we all know that part of the problem with the financial crisis was that folks were peddling mortgages that were unstable, that had these huge balloon payments that people didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully understand well.\xc2\xa0 Now there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some oversight in terms of how mortgages are shaped, and people are going to actually have to know what they\xe2\x80\x99re getting and what they\xe2\x80\x99re buying into.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to protect the economy, as well as individual consumers. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo this agency I think has the capacity to really provide middle-class families the kind of protection that\xe2\x80\x99s been lacking for too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the idea for this agency was Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s a dear friend of mine.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s somebody I\xe2\x80\x99ve known since I was in law school.\xc2\xa0 And I have been in conversations with her.\xc2\xa0 She is a tremendous advocate for this idea.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only been a couple of months, and this is a big task standing up this entire agency, so I\'ll have an announcement soon about how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forward. And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say is, is that I have had conversations with Elizabeth over the course of these -- over these last couple of months. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make an official announcement until it\xe2\x80\x99s ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you unofficially concerned about a Senate confirmation?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned about all Senate confirmations these days.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if I nominate somebody for dog catcher --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But with respect to Elizabeth Warren, are you --<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Hans, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to be funny.\xc2\xa0 I am concerned about all Senate nominations these days.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got people who have been waiting for six months to get confirmed who nobody has an official objection to and who were voted out of committee unanimously, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a vote on them.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got judges who are pending.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got people who are waiting to help us on critical issues like homeland security.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a determined minority in the Senate that insists on a 60-vote filibuster on every single person that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to confirm, even if after we break the filibuster, it turns out that they get 90 votes.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re just playing games.\xc2\xa0 And as I think Senator Voinovich said very well, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to stop playing games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll right.\xc2\xa0 Chuck Todd.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the theme, I think, of all of your answers, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just got a short question for you.\xc2\xa0 How have you changed Washington?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll tell you how we\xe2\x80\x99ve changed Washington.\xc2\xa0 Prior to us getting here, as I indicated before, you had a set of policies that were skewed toward special interests, skewed towards the most powerful, and ordinary families out there were being left behind.\xc2\xa0 And since we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten here, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that folks who can\xe2\x80\x99t get health insurance because of preexisting condition can now get health insurance, or children who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have coverage now have coverage; whether it\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that credit card companies have to actually post in understandable ways what your credit card rates are and they can\xe2\x80\x99t jack up existing balances in arbitrary ways; whether it\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got clean water and clean air for future generations; whether it\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that tax cuts go to families that need it as opposed to folks who don\xe2\x80\x99t -- on a whole range of issues over the last 18 months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place policies that are going to help grow a middle class and lay the foundation for long-term economic growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking why haven\xe2\x80\x99t I been able to create a greater spirit of cooperation in Washington, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s fair. I\xe2\x80\x99m as frustrated as anybody by it.\xc2\xa0 I think part of it has to do with the fact that when we came into office, we came in under very tough economic circumstances, and I think that some of the Republican leaders made a decision, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit on the sidelines and let the Democrats try to solve it.\xc2\xa0 And so we got a lot of resistance very early.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI think what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that when you take on tough issues like health care or financial regulatory reform, where special interests are deeply entrenched, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money at stake for them, and where the issues are so complicated that it drags on for a long time, you end up having a lot of big fights here in town.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s messy. And it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) --\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well -- and so there is no doubt that an option that was available to me when I came in was not to take on those issues.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we could had decided, you know what, even though we know that the pace of accelerating health care costs is going to bankrupt this economy and bankrupt businesses and bankrupt individuals, and even though we know that there are 30 million people, and that\'s a growing number of people, who don\'t have health insurance, we could have said, you know what, that\'s just too controversial, let\xe2\x80\x99s not take it on.\xc2\xa0 And we could have said with respect to financial regulatory reform, you know what, we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to get too much resistance from Republicans, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take that on.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI don\'t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of leadership that the American people would want from their President.\xc2\xa0 And are there things that I might have done during the course of 18 months that would at the margins have improved some of the tone in Washington? Probably.\xc2\xa0 Is some of this just a core difference in approach in terms of how we move this forward between Democrats and Republicans?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say the answer is a lot more the latter. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnne Kornblut.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Nine years after the September 11th attacks, why do you think it is that we are now seeing such an increase in suspicion and outright resentment of Islam, especially given that it has been one of your priorities to increase -- to improve relations with the Muslim world?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think that at a time when the country is anxious generally and going through a tough time, then fears can surface, suspicions, divisions can surface in a society. And so I think that plays a role in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I most admired about President Bush was after 9/11, him being crystal-clear about the fact that we were not at war with Islam.\xc2\xa0 We were at war with terrorists and murderers who had perverted Islam, had stolen its banner to carry out their outrageous acts.\xc2\xa0 And I was so proud of the country rallying around that idea, that notion that we are not going to be divided by religion; we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be divided by ethnicity.\xc2\xa0 We are all Americans.\xc2\xa0 We stand together against those who would try to do us harm.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done over the last nine years.\xc2\xa0 And we should take great pride in that.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is absolutely important now for the overwhelming majority of the American people to hang on to that thing that is best in us, a belief in religious tolerance, clarity about who our enemies are -- our enemies are al Qaeda and their allies who are trying to kill us, but have killed more Muslims than just about anybody on Earth.\xc2\xa0 We have to make sure that we don\'t start turning on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I will do everything that I can as long as I am President of the United States to remind the American people that we are one nation under God, and we may call that God different names but we remain one nation.\xc2\xa0 And as somebody who relies heavily on my Christian faith in my job, I understand the passions that religious faith can raise.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m also respectful that people of different faiths can practice their religion, even if they don\'t subscribe to the exact same notions that I do, and that they are still good people, and they are my neighbors and they are my friends, and they are fighting alongside us in our battles.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I want to make sure that this country retains that sense of purpose.\xc2\xa0 And I think tomorrow is a wonderful day for us to remind ourselves of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNatasha Mozgovaya of Haaretz. Is she here?\xc2\xa0 Natasha -- there you are back there.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, back in the region, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders, they sound a bit less ready for this historic compromise.\xc2\xa0 President Abbas, for example, said the Palestinians won\xe2\x80\x99t recognize Israel as a Jewish state.\xc2\xa0 The question is, if these talks fail at an early stage, will this administration disengage?\xc2\xa0 Or maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to step up and deepen your personal involvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu were here last week, and they came with a sense of purpose and seriousness and cordiality that, frankly, exceeded a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.\xc2\xa0 What they said was that they were serious about negotiating. They affirmed the goal of creating two states, living side by side in peace and security.\xc2\xa0 They have set up a schedule where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet every two weeks.\xc2\xa0 We are actively participating in that process.\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be flying to the Middle East for the first series of next meetings on September 14th and 15th.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is to bring the parties together to try to get them to recognize that the path for Israeli security and Palestinian sovereignty can only be met through negotiations. And these are going to be tough negotiations.\xc2\xa0 There are enormous hurdles between now and our endpoint, and there are going to be a whole bunch of folks in the region who want to undermine these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 We saw it when Hamas carried out these horrific attacks against civilians -- and explicitly said, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try to do this to undermine peace talks.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be rejectionists who suggest that it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and there are also going to be cynics who just believe that the mistrust between the sides is too deep.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nWe understood all that.\xc2\xa0 We understood that it was a risk for us to promote these discussions.\xc2\xa0 But it is a risk worth taking.\xc2\xa0 Because I firmly believe that it is in America\xe2\x80\x99s national security interests, as well as Israel\xe2\x80\x99s national security interests, as well as in the interests of the Palestinian people, to arrive at a peace deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason that I think Prime Minister Netanyahu was comfortable coming here was that he\xe2\x80\x99s seen, during the course of 18 months, that my administration is unequivocal in our defense of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in some unprecedented cooperation with Israel to make sure that they can deal with any external threats. But I think he also came here understanding that to maintain Israel as a Jewish state that is also a democratic state, this issue has to be dealt with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think President Abbas came here, despite great misgivings and pressure from the other side, because he understood the window for creating a Palestinian state is closing.\xc2\xa0 And there are a whole bunch of parties in the region who purport to be friends of the Palestinians and yet do everything they can to avoid the path that would actually lead to a Palestinian state, would actually lead to their goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so the two parties need each other.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s going to work.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be up to them.\xc2\xa0 We can facilitate; we can encourage; we can tell them that we will stand behind them in their efforts and are willing to contribute as part of the broader international community in making this work.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately the parties have to make these decisions for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I remain hopeful, but this is going to be tough.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody out there thinking that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be easy. The main point I want to make is it\xe2\x80\x99s a risk worth taking because the alternative is a status quo that is unsustainable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so if these talks break down, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep on trying.\xc2\xa0 Over the long term, it has the opportunity, by the way, also to change the strategic landscape in the Middle East in a way that would be very helpful.\xc2\xa0 It would help us deal with an Iran that has not been willing to give up its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 It would help us deal with terrorist organizations in the region. So this is something in our interest.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not just doing this to feel good.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing it because it will help secure America as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake Tapper.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 First, were you concerned at all when you -- when the administration had Secretary of Defense Gates call this pastor in Florida that you were elevating somebody who is clearly from the fringe?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then more substantively, on health care reform, this is six months since health care passed.\xc2\xa0 You pledged, A, that you would bend the cost curve, and B, that you Democrats would be able to campaign on this.\xc2\xa0 And CMS reported yesterday that the cost curve is actually bending up, from 6.1 percent to 6.3 percent, post-health care legislation.\xc2\xa0 And the only Democrats I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen talking about health care legislation are running TV ads saying that they voted against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 With respect to the individual down in Florida, let me just say -- let me repeat what I said a couple of days ago.\xc2\xa0 The idea that we would burn the sacred texts of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s religion is contrary to what this country stands for.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s contrary to what this country -- this nation was founded on.\xc2\xa0 And my hope is, is that this individual prays on it and refrains from doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99m also Commander-in-Chief, and we are seeing today riots in Kabul, riots in Afghanistan, that threaten our young men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an obligation to send a very clear message that this kind of behavior or threats of action put our young men and women in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also the best imaginable recruiting tool for al Qaeda. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd although this may be one individual in Florida, part of my concern is to make sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t start having a whole bunch of folks all across the country think this is the way to get attention.\xc2\xa0 This is a way of endangering our troops -- our sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives who are sacrificing for us to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t play games with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I hardly think we\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who elevated this story.\xc2\xa0 But it is, in the age of the Internet, something that can cause us profound damage around the world, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take it seriously. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to health care, what I said during the debate is the same thing I\xe2\x80\x99m saying now and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing I will say three or four years from now.\xc2\xa0 Bending the cost curve on health care is hard to do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got hundreds of thousands of providers and doctors and systems and insurers.\xc2\xa0 And what we did was we took every idea out there about how to reduce or at least slow the costs of health care over time.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I said at the time, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen tomorrow, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen next year.\xc2\xa0 It took us decades to get into a position where our health care costs were going up 6, 7, 10 percent a year.\xc2\xa0 And so our goal is to slowly bring down those costs.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done so also by making sure that 31 million people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting health insurance are going to start getting it.\xc2\xa0 And we have now implemented the first phase of health care in a way that, by the way, has been complimented even by the opponents of health care reform.\xc2\xa0 It has been smooth.\xc2\xa0 And right now middle-class families all across America are going to be able to say to themselves, starting this month, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a kid who is under 26 and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have health insurance, that kid can stay on my health insurance.\xc2\xa0 If I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a child with a preexisting condition, an insurer can\xe2\x80\x99t deny me coverage.\xc2\xa0 If I get sick and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got health insurance, that insurance company can\xe2\x80\x99t arbitrarily drop my coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 4 million small businesses around the country who are already eligible and in some cases will be receiving a 35 percent tax break on health care for their employees. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve already met small businesses around the country who say, because of that, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be able to provide health care for my employees, I thought it was the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the CMS study from February predicted a 6.1 percent increase, and now, post-health care, 6.3 percent.\xc2\xa0 So it seems to have bent it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No, as I said, Jake, the -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the entire study.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you have.\xc2\xa0 But if you -- if what -- the reports are true, what they\'re saying is, is that as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care, at the margins that\'s going to increase our costs, we knew that.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t think that we were going to cover 30 million people for free, but that the long-term trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so our goal on health care is, if we can get, instead of health care costs going up 6 percent a year, it\xe2\x80\x99s going up at the level of inflation, maybe just slightly above inflation, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made huge progress.\xc2\xa0 And by the way, that is the single most important thing we could do in terms of reducing our deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we did it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important, and that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to implement it effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, and then the House Democrats running against health care -- if you could comment on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in a political season where every candidate out there has their own district, their own makeup, their own plan, their own message.\xc2\xa0 And in an environment where we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got 9.5 percent unemployment, people are going to make the best argument they can right now. And they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be taking polls of what their particular constituents are saying, and trying to align with that oftentimes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how political races work.<br/>\n<br/>\nApril Ryan.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 On the economy, could you discuss your efforts at reviewing history as it relates to the poverty agenda, meaning LBJ and Dr. King?\xc2\xa0 And also, since Senate Republicans are holding up the issue of Cobell and Pigford, too, can you make any assurances before you leave office that you will make sure that those awards are funded?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Let me take the second question first.\xc2\xa0 For those who aren\xe2\x80\x99t familiar, Cobell and Pigford relate to settlements surrounding historic discrimination against minority farmers who weren\xe2\x80\x99t oftentimes provided the same benefits as everybody else under the USDA.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a fair settlement.\xc2\xa0 It is a just settlement.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Congress to fund that settlement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make it a priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to the history of fighting poverty, I got my start in public service as a community organizer working in the shadow steel plants that had been closed in some of the poorest neighborhoods on the South Side of Chicago.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what led me to want to serve.\xc2\xa0 And so I am constantly thinking about how do we create ladders for communities and individuals to climb into the middle class.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I think the history of anti-poverty efforts is, is that the most important anti-poverty effort is growing the economy and making sure there are enough jobs out there -- single most important thing we can do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more important than any program we could set up.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more important than any transfer payment that we could have.\xc2\xa0 If we can grow the economy faster and create more jobs, then everybody is swept up into that virtuous cycle.\xc2\xa0 And if the economy is shrinking and things are going badly, then the folks who are most vulnerable are going to be those poorest communities. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what we want to focus on right now is broad-based job growth and broad-based economic expansion.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing so against some tough headwinds, because, as I said, we are coming out of a very difficult -- very difficult time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve started to turn the corner but we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so that is going to be my central focus:\xc2\xa0 How do I grow the economy?\xc2\xa0 How do I make sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s more job growth?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t some targeted things we can do to help communities that are especially in need.\xc2\xa0 And probably the most important thing we can do after growing the economy generally is how can we improve school systems in low-income communities.\xc2\xa0 And I am very proud of the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on education reform -- which have received praise from Democrats and Republicans. This is one area where actually we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some good bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the idea is very simple. If we can make sure that we have the very best teachers in the classroom, if we can reward excellence instead of mediocrity and the status quo, if we can make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re tracking progress in real, serious ways and we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to make investments in what goes on in the classroom and not the school bureaucracy, and reward innovation, then schools can improve.\xc2\xa0 There are models out there of schools in the toughest inner-city neighborhood that are now graduating kids, 90 percent of whom are going to college.\xc2\xa0 And the key is how do we duplicate those?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so what our Race to the Top program has done is it\xe2\x80\x99s said to every state around the country, instead of just getting money based on a formula, we want you to compete.\xc2\xa0 Show us how you are reforming your school systems to promote excellence, based on proven ideas out there.\xc2\xa0 And if you do that, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reward you with some extra money.\xc2\xa0 And just the competition alone has actually spurred 46 states so far to initiate legislation designed to reform the school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we\xe2\x80\x99re very proud of that, and that I think is going to be one of the most important things we can do. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just, by the way, K-12.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also -- it\xe2\x80\x99s also higher education.\xc2\xa0 And as a consequence of a battle that we had -- and it was a contentious battle -- in Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to take tens of billions of dollars that were going to banks and financial intermediaries in the student loan program and said we\xe2\x80\x99re going to give that money directly to students so that they get more help going to college.\xc2\xa0 And obviously poor kids are the ones who are going to benefit most from those programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelene Cooper.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 How can you lecture Hamid Karzai about corruption when so many of these corrupt people are on the U.S. payroll?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the Middle East, do you believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should extend the settlement moratorium as a gesture to peace?\xc2\xa0 And if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, what are you prepared to do to stop the Palestinians from walking?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, we are in the midst of a very difficult but very important project.\xc2\xa0 I just want to remind people why we\xe2\x80\x99re there -- the day before September 11th.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re there because that was the place where al Qaeda launched an attack that killed 3,000 Americans.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that we dismantle al Qaeda, and that Afghanistan is never again used as a base for attacks against Americans and the American homeland. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Afghanistan is also the second poorest country in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got an illiteracy rate of 70 percent.\xc2\xa0 It has a multiethnic population that mistrusts, oftentimes, each other.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a tradition of a strong, central government. <br/>\nSo what we have done is to say we are going to, after seven years of drift, after seven years of policies in which, for example, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t even effectively training Afghan security forces, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is to say we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with the Afghan government to train Afghan security forces so they can be responsible for their own security.\xc2\xa0 We are going to promote a political settlement in the region that can help to reduce the violence.\xc2\xa0 We are going to encourage a Afghan government that can deliver services for its people.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try to make sure that as part of helping President Karzai stand up a broadly accepted, legitimate government, that corruption is reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress on some of those fronts.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when it comes to corruption, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give you an example.\xc2\xa0 Four years ago, 11 judges in the Afghan legal system were indicted for corruption.\xc2\xa0 This year, 86 were indicted for corruption.\xc2\xa0 We have seen Afghan-led efforts that have gone after police commanders, significant business people in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from where we need to be on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd every time I talk to President Karzai I say that, as important as it is for us to help you train your military and your police forces, the only way that you are going to have a stable government over the long term is if the Afghan people feel that you\'re looking out for them.\xc2\xa0 And that means making sure that the tradition of corruption in the government is reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep on putting pressure on them on that front.\xc2\xa0 Is it going to happen overnight? Probably not.\xc2\xa0 Are there going to be occasions where we look and see that some of our folks on the ground have made compromises with people who are known to have engaged in corruption?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing all that constantly and there may be occasions where that happens.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly right, Helene, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not sending a mixed message here.\xc2\xa0 So one of the things that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to my national security team is let\xe2\x80\x99s be consistent, in terms of how we operate, across agencies. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that our efforts there are not seen as somehow giving a wink and a nod to corruption.\xc2\xa0 If we are saying publicly that that\'s important, then our actions have to match up across the board.\xc2\xa0 But it is a challenging environment in which to do that.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, with respect to Prime Minister Netayanhu and the Middle East, a major bone of contention during the course of this month is going to be the potential lapse of the settlement moratorium.\xc2\xa0 The irony is, is that when Prime Minister Netanyahu put the moratorium in place, the Palestinians were very skeptical.\xc2\xa0 They said this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything.\xc2\xa0 And it turns out, to Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s credit and to the Israeli government\xe2\x80\x99s credit, the settlement moratorium has actually been significant. It has significantly reduced settlement construction in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why now the Palestinians say, you know what, even though we weren\xe2\x80\x99t that keen on it at first or we thought it was just window dressing, it turns out that this is important to us. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to Prime Minister Netanyahu is that, given, so far, the talks are moving forward in a constructive way, it makes sense to extend that moratorium so long as the talks are moving in a constructive way.\xc2\xa0 Because, ultimately, the way to solve these problems is for the two sides to agree what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be Israel, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the state of Palestine.\xc2\xa0 And if you can get that agreement, then you can start constructing anything that the people of Israel see fit in undisputed areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I think the politics for Prime Minister Netanyahu are very difficult.\xc2\xa0 His coalition -- I think there are a number of members of his coalition who\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to continue this.\xc2\xa0 And so one of the things that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to President Abbas is, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to show the Israeli public that you are serious and constructive in these talks so that the politics for Prime Minister Netanyahu -- if he were to extend the settlements moratorium -- would be a little bit easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one of the goals I think that I\xe2\x80\x99ve set for myself and for my team is to make sure that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu start thinking about how can they help the other succeed, as opposed to how do they figure out a way for the other to fail.\xc2\xa0 Because if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be successful in bringing about what they now agree is the best course of action for their people, the only way they\xe2\x80\x99re going to succeed is if they are seeing the world through the other person\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\xc2\xa0 And that requires a personal relationship and building trust.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, these meetings will help do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn Compton.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, what does it say about the status of American system of justice when so many of those who are thought to be plotters for September 11th or accused, suspected terrorists are still awaiting any kind of trial?\xc2\xa0 Are you -- why are you still convinced that a civilian trial is correct for Sheikh -- Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?\xc2\xa0 And why has that stalled?\xc2\xa0 And will Guantanamo remain open for another year?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have succeeded on delivering a lot of campaign promises that we made.\xc2\xa0 One where we\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen short is closing Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to close it sooner.\xc2\xa0 We have missed that deadline.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not for lack of trying. It\xe2\x80\x99s because the politics of it are difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I am absolutely convinced that the American justice system is strong enough that we should be able to convict people who murdered innocent Americans, who carried out terrorist attacks against us.\xc2\xa0 We should be able to lock them up and make sure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t see the light of day.\xc2\xa0 We can do that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got people who engaged in terrorist attacks who are in our prisons, maximum security prisons, all across the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is an issue that has generated a lot of political rhetoric and people, understandably, are fearful.\xc2\xa0 But one of the things that I think is worth reflecting on after 9/11 is this country is so resilient, we are so tough, we can\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened by a handful of people who are trying to do us harm, especially when we\xe2\x80\x99ve captured them and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the goods on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve also said that there are going to be circumstances where a military tribunal may be appropriate, and the reason for that is -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give a specific example.\xc2\xa0 There may be situations in which somebody was captured in theater, is now in Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to piece together a chain of evidence that would meet some of the evidentiary standards that would be required in an Article III court.\xc2\xa0 But we know that this person is guilty; there\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient evidence to bring about a conviction.\xc2\xa0 So what I have said is the military commission system that we set up -- where appropriate for certain individuals that would make -- it would be difficult to try in Article III courts for a range of reasons -- we can reform that system so that it meets the highest standards of due process and prosecute them there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans. And we over the course of the last year have been in constant conversations with them about setting up a sensible system in which we are prosecuting where appropriate those in Article III courts.\xc2\xa0 We are prosecuting others where appropriate through a military tribunal.\xc2\xa0 And in either case, let\xe2\x80\x99s put them in prisons where our track record is they\xe2\x80\x99ve never escaped.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, just from a purely fiscal point of view, the costs of holding folks in Guantanamo is massively higher than it is holding them in a super maximum security prison here in the United States. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?\xc2\xa0 Will that trial ever happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with members of Congress -- and this is going to have to be on a bipartisan basis -- to move this forward in a way that is consistent with our standards of due process, consistent with our Constitution, consistent also with our image in the world of a country that cares about rule of law.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate the impact of that.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAl Qaeda operatives still cite Guantanamo as a justification for attacks against the United States. Still to this day.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for us to give them that kind of talking point when, in fact, we can use the various mechanisms of our justice system to prosecute these folks and to make sure that they never attack us again. <br/>\n<br/>\nEd Henry.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, you were talking about some of the al Qaeda leaders that you have captured.\xc2\xa0 One that you have not is Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow is going to be nine years since he was the mastermind of 3,000 Americans being killed.\xc2\xa0 And what you said -- obviously, the last administration had seven years and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 But what you said as President-elect to CBS is, \xe2\x80\x9cI think capturing or killing bin Laden is a critical aspect of stamping out al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 He is not just a symbol.\xc2\xa0 He is also the operational leader of an organization planning attacks against the U.S.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you still believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a critical part of your policy to capture or kill him?\xc2\xa0 And do you think -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a failure of your administration that here it\xe2\x80\x99s almost two years in -- you campaigned saying you were going to run a smarter war on terror than the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t captured him and you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know where he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I think capturing or killing bin Laden and Zawahiri would be extremely important to our national security.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve all our problems, but it remains a high priority of this administration.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been successful at over the last two years is to ramp up the pressure on al Qaeda and their key leaders.\xc2\xa0 And as a consequence, they have been holed up in ways that have made it harder for them to operate.\xc2\xa0 And part of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened is bin Laden has gone deep underground.\xc2\xa0 Even Zawahiri, who is more often out there, has been much more cautious. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut we have the best minds, the best intelligence officers, the best special forces, who are thinking about this day and night.\xc2\xa0 And they will continue to think about it day and night as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m President.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, sir, do you think Americans are going to face another nine years of this terror threat, another generation?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your message to them?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I think.\xc2\xa0 I think that in this day and age, there are going to be -- there is always going to be the potential for an individual or a small group of individuals, if they are willing to die, to kill other people.\xc2\xa0 Some of them are going to be very well organized and some of them are going to be random.\xc2\xa0 That threat is there.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important, I think, for the American people to understand that, and not to live in fear.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a reality of today\xe2\x80\x99s world that there are going to be threats out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have, I think, greatly improved our homeland security since 9/11 occurred.\xc2\xa0 I am constantly impressed with the dedication that our teams apply to this problem.\xc2\xa0 They are chasing down every thread not just from al Qaeda but any other actor out there that might be engaging in terrorism.\xc2\xa0 They are making sure that even a -- what might appear to be a lone individual who has very little organizational capacity -- if they make a threat, they follow up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one of the things that I want to make sure we do as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m President, and beyond my presidency, is to understand America\xe2\x80\x99s strength in part comes from its resilience, and that we don\'t start losing who we are or overreacting if, in fact, there is the threat of terrorism out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go about our business.\xc2\xa0 We are tougher than them.\xc2\xa0 Our families and our businesses and our churches and mosques and synagogues and our Constitution, our values, that\'s what gives us strength.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to have this problem out there for a long time to come.\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to completely distort us. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to dominate our foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 What we can do is to constantly fight against it.\xc2\xa0 And I think ultimately, we are going to be able to stamp it out.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Last question. <br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if I can get you to weigh in on the wisdom of building a mosque a couple of blocks from Ground Zero.\xc2\xa0 We know that the organizers have the constitutional right.\xc2\xa0 What would it say about this country if they were somehow talked out of doing that?\xc2\xa0 And hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Florida minister\xe2\x80\x99s threat to burn a couple hundred copies of the Koran, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the threat itself put American lives in danger, sir?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the second -- on your second question, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that when someone goes out of their way to be provocative in ways that we know can inflame the passions of over a billion Muslims around the world, at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got our troops in a lot of Muslim countries, that\'s a problem.\xc2\xa0 And it has made life a lot more difficult for our men and women in uniform who already have a very difficult job.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to the mosque in New York, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear on my position here, and that is, is that this country stands for the proposition that all men and women are created equal; that they have certain inalienable rights -- one of those inalienable rights is to practice their religion freely. And what that means is that if you could build a church on a site, you could build a synagogue on a site, if you could build a Hindu temple on a site, then you should be able to build a mosque on the site.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I recognize the extraordinary sensitivities around 9/11.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve met with families of 9/11 victims in the past.\xc2\xa0 I can only imagine the continuing pain and anguish and sense of loss that they may go through.\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow we as Americans are going to be joining them in prayer and remembrance.\xc2\xa0 But I go back to what I said earlier:\xc2\xa0 We are not at war against Islam.\xc2\xa0 We are at war against terrorist organizations that have distorted Islam or falsely used the banner of Islam to engage in their destructive acts.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be clear about that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be clear about that because if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with the problems that Ed Henry was talking about, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to successfully reduce the terrorist threat, then we need all the allies we can get.\xc2\xa0 The folks who are most interested in a war between the United States or the West and Islam are al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been banking on.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd fortunately, the overwhelming majority of Muslims around the world are peace-loving, are interested in the same things that you and I are interested in:\xc2\xa0 How do I make sure I can get a good job?\xc2\xa0 How can I make sure that my kids get a decent education?\xc2\xa0 How can I make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m safe?\xc2\xa0 How can I improve my lot in life?\xc2\xa0 And so they have rejected this violent ideology for the most part -- overwhelmingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so from a national security interest, we want to be clear about who the enemy is here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful, a tiny minority of people who are engaging in horrific acts, and have killed Muslims more than anybody else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other reason it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to remember that is because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got millions of Muslim Americans, our fellow citizens, in this country.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to school with our kids.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re our neighbors.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re our friends.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re our coworkers.\xc2\xa0 And when we start acting as if their religion is somehow offensive, what are we saying to them?\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got Muslims who are fighting in Afghanistan in the uniform of the United States armed services. They\xe2\x80\x99re out there putting their lives on the line for us.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure that we are crystal-clear for our sakes and their sakes they are Americans and we honor their service.\xc2\xa0 And part of honoring their service is making sure that they understand that we don\xe2\x80\x99t differentiate between them and us.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just us.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is a principle that I think is going to be very important for us to sustain.\xc2\xa0 And I think tomorrow is an excellent time for us to reflect on that.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much, everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nEND<br/>\n12:18 P.M.
