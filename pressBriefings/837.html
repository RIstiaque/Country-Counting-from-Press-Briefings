EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for traveling with us today, as ever and in day two of this spectacular bus tour in Florida.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements from my side, so I\'ll turn it over to my colleague, Jen Psaki.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 All right, I\'m like juggling a few things here.\xc2\xa0 Two things -- one I\'ve already flagged for all of you, but the President will today -- will highlight a new analysis from Harvard Professor David Cutler that shows that under the Romney/Ryan plan, someone who retires in 2030 can expect to pay an extra $125,000 over their lifetime for Medicare.\xc2\xa0 And at the same time, while retirees will be stuck with the tab, insurance company profits are expected to increase by as much as $26 billion a year.\xc2\xa0 I sent around the study.\xc2\xa0 But, of course, if anyone didn\'t receive, let me know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second piece I just wanted to highlight is clearly that we\'re going to be traveling to the Space Coast today where the success of the space industry is a big economic issue.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a big issue for the people of the community.\xc2\xa0 The President will talk about the ambitious new direction for NASA that we have undertaken, the new era of space exploration that we are currently pursuing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he\'ll also talk about how exciting -- and I know, because he has spoken about this a lot, it was when we landed on Mars.\xc2\xa0 So he\'ll talk about that in his remarks today as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what\'s interesting is that a big part of our strategy --\xc2\xa0 or a big part of our work to help the economy in the Space Coast has been by partnering with the private-sector companies and really encouraging them to take a stake in the success of the industry.\xc2\xa0 And just last year, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Space Coast attracted more than 2,300 jobs, $240 million in capital investment and $360 million in new construction.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn contrast, the Romney budget proposal would require huge cuts to non-defense spending, as we\'ve mentioned a few times before.\xc2\xa0 And that could force the deepest cuts to these programs in 40 years, which would obviously have a devastating impact on the people of the Space Coast.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when asked about NASA\'s role in space, Mitt Romney has said he wasn\'t sure.\xc2\xa0 So even though he has been running for five or six years now, he clearly hasn\'t had time to give it a lot of thought.\xc2\xa0 Those are just the two pieces I wanted to preview and we\'ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Romney camp says that the data that Cutler uses in that study -- coffee spillage -- that the data is dated because Romney\'s plan is not the same as the 2011 budget that Ryan put out.\xc2\xa0 So does the analysis require a new look?\xc2\xa0 Is it, in fact, dated as the Romney camp claims?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, David Cutler is not the first outside analyst to take a look at the impact of the Romney/Ryan plans on Medicare.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of components here -- it\'s not just the budget.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also the impact of getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, which as we know they have made no secret of their plan to do that immediately.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also know that there is a clear motivation on their part for trying to discredit a study, as they have tried before with the Tax Policy Center Study, that they don\'t feel fits in their narrative.\xc2\xa0 So I would say this is a study by a very credible, well respected economist.\xc2\xa0 He looked at a series of data.\xc2\xa0 The findings of the study are not inconsistent with other studies that have been out there about the impact that the Romney/Ryan plan would have on Medicare, in terms of raising costs and the money that would go back to insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 But this is a new -- just another peg here, indicating that this is something that should be a flag for seniors across Florida.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And to your point, Jim, it is a fact that if you repeal health care reform, there are immediate negative effects for seniors on Medicare.\xc2\xa0 The doughnut hole reopens.\xc2\xa0 That results in hundreds -- and in some cases more costs for an average senior annually.\xc2\xa0 Preventive care services that are provided free under health care reform -- cancer screenings -- mammograms, other cancer screenings -- that many millions of seniors are taking advantage of go away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you can either acknowledge that the savings the President introduced into Medicare through the health care reform that reduces costs -- health care costs and subsidies and payments to insurance companies -- are valid and useful because they extend the life of Medicare, which Paul Ryan did when he first introduced his plan; or you can claim you\'re not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 But then you have to acknowledge that you\'ve eviscerated eight years of extended life for Medicare, and that Medicare will begin to become insolvent in 2016, which is a terrifying prospect I think for today\'s seniors.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to ask about another issue the Romney campaign is raising as the President makes his way to West Palm Beach, which is the issue of Jerusalem.\xc2\xa0 What\'s in the platform?\xc2\xa0 And the fact that although the platform apparently reflects the President\'s views, the President has not come out himself in the last three days and championed Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\xc2\xa0 So I wanted to ask you what are the diplomatic considerations involved?\xc2\xa0 Do you believe this is an issue that will be a problem for the President in Jewish parts of Florida -- and if not, why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this probably falls to me.\xc2\xa0 The platform reflects the President\'s position that Jerusalem is and should be the capital of Israel.\xc2\xa0 It is also a case, as a matter of policy of the United States and of this administration -- and of every previous administration dating back to 1967 -- that the status of Jerusalem has to be decided by the parties as part of a comprehensive peace agreement.\xc2\xa0 That is a position that George W. Bush held, and that Bill Clinton held and their predecessors held.\xc2\xa0 And that is this President\'s position, as a matter of policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a risk, if you were to be publicly speaking as President about what\'s in the platform, of harming those negotiations?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\'re saying?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not saying that at all.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that there is an administration policy -- I mean, if you were to ask him about this, this is obviously -- very clear what his policy has been and what his views are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the issue of Jerusalem\'s status has been reserved for final status negotiations and recognized as such by administrations both Republican and Democratic in the past.\xc2\xa0 And it has to be that, because that\'s -- a comprehensive peace has to be achieved between the two parties, and Jerusalem and its status is obviously one of those issues that needs to be resolved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Explain how that works in terms of it\'s the policy of the administration and of the President to say it is the capital, and yet also it\'s something that still has to be worked out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s in the platform, which is where it\'s been in previous years, in previous presidential election years.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s personal view that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel is also something he has said in the past.\xc2\xa0 But it is up to the parties to decide through final status negotiations what the complex or final disposition of Jerusalem will be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that has been the position of this administration, of President Bush\'s administration, of President Clinton\'s administration and of the administrations prior to those.\xc2\xa0 It is -- again, the way to a comprehensive peace is by bringing the parties together to resolve these issues.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, Jerusalem is one of those.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, doesn\'t it prejudge these negotiations then, for the President to come out and say, I actually believe that Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel?\xc2\xa0 Why not say, I think Jerusalem should also be the capital of the Palestinian territory?\xc2\xa0 And does he believe that too?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No more than it prejudged the outcome of negotiations that took place under President Clinton or President Bush.\xc2\xa0 It has been the position of the United States government, administrations both Republican and Democratic, that Jerusalem is a final status issue that needs to be resolved by the parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd both President Clinton and President Bush made aggressive efforts to help bring the parties together to resolve their differences and reach a comprehensive peace.\xc2\xa0 It remains elusive, but it is a goal that this President remains committed to.\xc2\xa0 But it is absolutely his belief and position that the basket of issues that fall into the final status category have to be negotiated and resolved by the parties.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the only way to achieve a comprehensive peace.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he also believe that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to negotiate the finer points of our policy towards the Middle East peace process, which I know you\'re familiar with.\xc2\xa0 Our position, the President\'s positions have been stated and clear since he took office.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is a very challenging problem for the region and the world, as well as obviously the two parties.\xc2\xa0 And this President remains committed to pursuing peace in the Middle East, and believes firmly that the only way to achieve that is through negotiations between the two parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe made that clear when he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly last year and has made that clear every time he\'s focused on or been asked about this topic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the platform was being drafted, there was obviously a platform drafting committee that went through several steps that Governor Strickland was leading.\xc2\xa0 How did it get through all those different steps, given that as you said this is something the President believes without this language, without anyone noticing that this language was not in the platform?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I can only speak to the President\'s role in this, which is that as soon as he learned of the language and the fact that it wasn\'t consistent with the 2008 platform, he directed his staff to change it.\xc2\xa0 And it shouldn\'t come -- if he had gone through with a fine-toothed comb every aspect and every page of the Democratic Platform Committee document, he would have been the first President probably in history to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what\'s important here is what steps he took when he knew the language was different from what he would like it to be.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, the final result was what he wanted it to be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he didn\'t know of this until he saw it on television, until he was told of it?\xc2\xa0 How did he come to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Until -- and we\'ve gone through this a couple of times before, but until he saw news reports the morning of the platform committee vote, which was that Wednesday, the day before he gave his speech.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as he learned, he directed his staff to make the changes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Along those lines, also yesterday Governor Romney in Virginia said that he would never take God out of the platform or off the U.S. currency.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama have any plans to change the "In God We Trust" on the currency?\xc2\xa0 Or if not, what would --</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, with all due respect, it\'s hard to take the premise of your question seriously.\xc2\xa0 But, look, this is nothing more than a desperate attack based on a false premise by the Romney team.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s sad that the debate has been driven to this level of discourse.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes as much that God should be taken out of -- off a coin as he does that aliens are going to come attack Florida.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just an absurd issue that was raised, an absurd question to be posed.\xc2\xa0 And, really, our hope is to get back to the debate about what the American people are focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what\'s it say about the race that Governor Romney is -- appears to be making a play to more conservative voters?\xc2\xa0 Does it suggest that he at least is reaching for voters on the right as opposed to the middle?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 It was clear as soon as Mitt Romney selected Paul Ryan as his running mate, the most important decision he\'s made since he started running for office, that their goal was to go after the conservative base.\xc2\xa0 The field is narrowing.\xc2\xa0 We know there\'s still a long time to go.\xc2\xa0 The race is going to be very competitive and we\'re not taking a single vote for granted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\'s clear from some of the steps they\'ve taken -- including selecting Paul Ryan as the big starring one -- that their goal is to go after the conservative base.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s how they\'re hoping to energize and excite voters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll also mention, because I forgot to mention at the top, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you all had an opportunity to watch the Sunday shows this morning.\xc2\xa0 I know I\'m sure you all TiVo them every week and watch breathlessly.\xc2\xa0 But Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan were both on Sunday shows.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the fascinating things that came out of it was that clearly they need to negotiate with each other about sequestration and about what they think should happen for the Grand Bargain, because not only did they conflict each other on what they said about it, but Mitt Romney essentially attacked Paul Ryan\'s support for the trigger to begin with.\xc2\xa0 So if that\'s not alarming, I\'m not sure what is.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond that, there isn\'t enough paper on this bus to do a fact check of the two of their interviews together -- everything from sequestration, to the auto bailout, to jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 And that should be alarming to the American people when they\'re looking for answers about how we\'re going to address the tough problems we\'re facing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just note -- and, Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99re a veteran, you would recognize this, that, again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, having covered a lot of presidential campaigns, there\xe2\x80\x99s always a stage, there\xe2\x80\x99s a spot, a period when the argument is not going your way -- even sometimes on the subjects you wanted the arguments to be about -- and you begin to see random issues thrown up like spaghetti against the wall to see if anything can stick.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say based on my experience covering presidential campaigns that that has ever really worked as a strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the interview, two points that Romney made, one was on tax cuts, he stated that at no point would he, in fact, lower the tax burden on wealthy taxpayers because he would eliminate enough loopholes to keep their tax burden the same, even though he lowered rates.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also said that he wanted to keep some elements of the Obama health care plan, including retaining the protection for preexisting conditions and young people being able to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you had any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean -- so, let me take the first.\xc2\xa0 I mean they were both asked, if I remember correctly, I know Mitt Romney was, about their tax plans and how they could pay for it -- to your point -- what they didn\'t provide was any details or facts about how the arithmetic exactly added up.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a credibility issue when it comes to Mitt Romney saying something about his proposals and expecting people to just take his word for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there was another period during that interview, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen time and time again, where there was just a lack of specificity provided.\xc2\xa0 And while he said what you just said, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to explain the arithmetic of how is tax plan exactly added up.\xc2\xa0 And as we know, countless outside independent economists have argued that, in fact, the arithmetic doesn\'t add up.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll say on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the health care piece, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- one, we all know that the health care plan has a number of incredible benefits, of course, keeping young people on their parent\xe2\x80\x99s insurance, people with preexisting conditions, but there are components of it that make the math and, frankly, the cost work, which is why you\xe2\x80\x99d need to keep -- why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting and the President has been fighting to keep the full thrust of the plan in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while Mitt Romney has said he would veto the plan on the first day, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as easy as keeping some of the pieces that he seems to like and doing away with the other pieces that allow us to -- the federal government, states -- to pay for the plan, which is requiring people to have insurance, requiring -- reducing the benefits to insurance companies, so it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s just another failing math grade for Mitt Romney on the health care plan, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just quickly?\xc2\xa0 Jim, the Tax Policy Center examined this specifically.\xc2\xa0 They said in their analysis that they were bending over backwards to be generous to the assumptions about the kinds of savings that the Romney plan would achieve by closing loopholes or other vague promises about how they would keep the tax reform portion of his plan revenue-neutral.\xc2\xa0 And as Bill Clinton would say, and the Tax Policy Center\xe2\x80\x99s analysis affirmed, the arithmetic just doesn\'t work.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t just make up numbers.</p>\n<p>\n\tShort of finding a pot of gold with several trillion dollars in it, there is no way to -- mathematically to find the money you need to pay for those massive tax cuts within the loopholes and tax breaks that currently exist for wealthy Americans, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do what Governor Romney has promised on capital gains and in other areas where he refuses to accept the notion that we need to ask wealthier Americans to pay their fair share and to be part of a balanced approach to solving our fiscal challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On space, Jen, you talked about the Mars aspect, but a lot of people in Florida are upset with how the end of the shuttle program was handled and don\'t see a really robust future for the space industry that will make up for the jobs that are being lost in it now.\xc2\xa0 How do you make up for those concerns?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Do you want to take the beginning of this, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things, Jeff, which I know you know, it was the prior administration of President George W. Bush that announced the end of the space shuttle program.\xc2\xa0 President Obama extended the life of that program by two launches.\xc2\xa0 An independent commission analyzed the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposals for continued human space flight and found them not feasible under any plausible budget scenario.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has done is refocused NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mission on far-reaching goals of eventually sending men and women to Mars, and leveraging private-sector money to continue our participation in the space station program.\xc2\xa0 And I think while there is no question that the end of the shuttle program cost jobs on the Space Coast, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a lot of private-sector investment coming in.\xc2\xa0 There was a story I think just today or yesterday on CNBC that went into a lot of detail about some very encouraging robustness in the investments in the area, where companies are coming in and taking advantage of the highly trained workforce that exists.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And just to build on that, Boeing, SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, these are some of the companies that have come in and invested and really taken a stake in the success of the program.\xc2\xa0 And economically, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for them as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s some irony here because Mitt Romney has repeatedly said that the private sector should have a role, should have a stake in the economy.\xc2\xa0 This is exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here in Florida.\xc2\xa0 We know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen some progress made, and we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd on the Mars front, I know I touched on this briefly but science and investing in innovation is clearly a priority of the President, as illustrated in his budget, but even on a personal level, one of the times he\xe2\x80\x99s been most excited on the plane was when he was doing a call about the update on the Mars landing.\xc2\xa0 So this is something he has a personal commitment to and he wants to see it work.\xc2\xa0 And the interest and engagement of the private sector has been encouraging.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:35 A.M.
