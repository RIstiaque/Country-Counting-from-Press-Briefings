CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Hello, everyone. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s very good to see you. \xc2\xa0Thanks for taking care of Josh in my absence last week.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBefore I take your questions, I want to say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0One, and perhaps most importantly, I apologize for keeping you here to miss the opening pitches of the Red Sox versus Yankees game and the Marlins at the Nationals here. \xc2\xa0I, for one, wish I were at the stadium, because it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very exciting season I think for Nationals and Red Sox fans, of which I am one.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d also like to say something about the fact that this morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee announced its hearing for our D.C. Circuit Court nominee, Sri Srinivasan. \xc2\xa0As you know, Sri is the Principal Deputy Solicitor General, but you may not know that Sri was born in India and raised in Lawrence, Kansas, eventually becoming an all-star point guard at Lawrence High School. \xc2\xa0And, of course, he is still recovering today from the loss by his beloved Kansas Jayhawks over the weekend.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSri is of course also a highly respected appellate advocate who has spent a distinguished career litigating before the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals, both in private practice and on behalf of the United States for both Democratic and Republican administrations. \xc2\xa0He has argued before the Supreme Court 24 times; drafted briefs and several dozen additional cases; and has also served as lead counsel in numerous cases before the federal and state appellate courts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs a testament to how highly regarded he is by members of both parties, 12 former officials from the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s office -- six of them Democrats, six of them Republicans -- all announced their support for Sri today. \xc2\xa0The signatories of the letter, including Paul Clement, Ted Olson, Ken Starr, and Walter Dellinger, write, \xe2\x80\x9cSri has a first-rate intellect, an open-minded approach to the law, a strong work ethic, and an unimpeachable character. \xc2\xa0Sri is one of the best appellate lawyers in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe D.C. Circuit, as you know, is often considered the nation\xe2\x80\x99s second-highest court, but it has twice as many vacancies as any other court of appeals, and its workload has increased by over 20 percent since 2005. \xc2\xa0Sri\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation will be an important first step to filling this court\xe2\x80\x99s four vacancies, and he will be, when confirmed, the first South Asian circuit court judge in history.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe also urge the Senate to move swiftly to confirm the 15 additional judicial nominees waiting for votes. \xc2\xa0Of those 15, 13 were approved out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously; not a single Republican dissent. \xc2\xa0And four would fill judicial emergencies; six are represented by Republican home-state senators who support their nominations.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, as I mentioned, the last time I gave an update on our judicial nominees, we have seen some progress lately and we are grateful for that. \xc2\xa0Since the beginning of the year, the Senate has confirmed nine judicial nominees, and that is good. \xc2\xa0But it is worth noting that, on average, these nine judges waited 144 days for a floor vote, compared to President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s nominees who waited an average of 34 days for a vote at this point in President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s presidency. \xc2\xa0And it just underscores the seriousness of the situation; the uniqueness of the delay that we face in getting nominees confirmed; the arbitrariness of the delays when you have a situation where so many of them are voted out of committee unanimously and then never given a floor vote.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe urge that the Senate act expeditiously to take up and consider and confirm this particular nomination, but also to move forward on these others.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith that, I go to your questions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with immigration. \xc2\xa0We got news over the weekend that business and labor had reached a deal on a guest worker program for low-skilled immigrants. \xc2\xa0Any reaction to the development?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say broadly that we are encouraged by the continuing signs of progress that we are seeing in the Senate as the Group of Eight and the Senate, more broadly, works on comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0We are also encouraged by reports, as you note, of an agreement, or progress at least, between the Chamber of Commerce and labor on that particular aspect of immigration reform.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s principles are clear. \xc2\xa0We are, again, encouraged by the progress. \xc2\xa0We note comments by Senators Graham, Schumer, and Flake over the weekend about just how far that group has come and how close they are to producing an agreement, and we find that good news. \xc2\xa0However, we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet, and this process is still underway in the Senate. \xc2\xa0Legislation has to be written, drafted, and we will evaluate the specific aspects of that legislation when it is produced.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the path to citizenship, it\xe2\x80\x99s looking like the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to come out in the Senate is going to have a path to citizenship that\xe2\x80\x99s quite a long path -- 13 years or so -- and enough obstacles in it that far fewer than the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country would be eligible for that. \xc2\xa0Will the President lay down any markers about how clear a path to citizenship he needs to see in the legislation for him to be able to support it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President has said that, and has made clear in his blueprint, that there has to be an earned path to citizenship and it has to be real. \xc2\xa0It has to end in citizenship. \xc2\xa0It also has to require folks getting into the back of the line, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and it is part of a comprehensive approach to immigration reform that includes strengthening border security, continuing that effort; holding employers accountable; and bringing our immigration system into the 21st century. \xc2\xa0There are four key parts of the President\xe2\x80\x99s blueprint and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the progress being made in the Senate by the so-called Group of Eight that those principles are reflected in the work they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to, again, judge elements of the Senate legislation before it\xe2\x80\x99s written, before it\xe2\x80\x99s produced, before it\xe2\x80\x99s agreed to. \xc2\xa0And I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on reports about what may or may not be in it since that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, so then what does a real path to citizenship mean for him? \xc2\xa0I mean, would 13 years or 20 years -- what --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what may or may not be in the bill. \xc2\xa0It would be counterproductive to speculate and say that this would be unacceptable, this particular, random suggestion, and then, of course, find out that it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the bill at all. \xc2\xa0So -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m just using that as a general hypothetical, not specific to your question. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ll refrain from making those kinds of assessments from here. \xc2\xa0I would point you to the blueprint that I think is very clear and has been for some time about what the President believes a clear path to citizenship means and where it fits within comprehensive immigration reform.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a string of disturbing incidents with prosecutors being killed in Texas and the prison chief in Colorado. \xc2\xa0Is the White House doing anything extraordinary to help with that investigation, and have federal prosecutors been informed that they could possibly be targeted as well?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, the White House is not, obviously, involved in an investigation of that nature. \xc2\xa0I would refer you to the Department of Justice and the FBI for any role they might be playing at this time. \xc2\xa0I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, Jeff.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, a follow-up on immigration. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned or is the White House concerned at all that Senator Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s support may be waning?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I would point you to comments by three members of the Group of Eight -- Senators Graham, Schumer, and Flake, who made very positive comments about the progress that the group is making. \xc2\xa0I think it certainly is a fact that legislation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been completed, a bill hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been produced, so the process continues and is not finished.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut two Republican senators are on the record saying, and I think I have it here, Senator Graham saying that, \xe2\x80\x9dconceptually\xe2\x80\x9d -- and this is a quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cwe have an agreement between business and labor, between ourselves, that has to be drafted. \xc2\xa0It will be rolled out next week. \xc2\xa0Yes, I believe it will pass the House because it secures our borders and it controls who gets a job.\xe2\x80\x9d That was Senator Graham. \xc2\xa0You also saw positive statements from Senator Schumer -- \xe2\x80\x9cI am very, very optimistic that we will have an agreement among the eight of us next week.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0These are all welcome signs. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not celebrating prematurely. \xc2\xa0We await the product. \xc2\xa0We are engaged at a staff level with those who are working on legislation, and continue to hope that it will produce what the President has made clear he believes is essential for fairness, for our middle class, for our economy, and that is comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a top priority of the President.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s voice is especially important in this, right?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak for any individual senator, so I would direct your questions to him.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, the question is if you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about where he stands on this --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I would just point you to the statements by a number of members of the Group of Eight about the progress they\xe2\x80\x99re making, how close they are to an agreement. \xc2\xa0I would also note that work remains to be done in drafting legislation, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get too far ahead of the process and I would -- in terms of the comments that individual senators make about possible concerns they have, I would direct you to their offices.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Apropos concerns on a separate issue. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned about the escalating tensions with North Korea? \xc2\xa0And does the White House believe that the U.S. actions on this are contributing to those tensions in any way?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, not at all. \xc2\xa0The United States is committed to maintaining peace and security in the region, as you know. \xc2\xa0North Korea should stop its provocative threats and instead concentrate on abiding by its international obligations. \xc2\xa0And pursuit of nuclear and missile programs -- its pursuit, rather, of those programs, does not make it more secure but only increases its isolation and seriously undermines its ability to pursue economic development. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI would note that despite the harsh rhetoric we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from Pyongyang, we are not seeing changes to the North Korean military posture, such as large-scale mobilizations and positioning of forces. \xc2\xa0Now, we take this seriously. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past. \xc2\xa0And we are vigilant and we are monitoring the Korean situation very diligently. \xc2\xa0And as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re in close, regular contact with our team in Korea; that would be both General Thurman and Ambassador Kim, both of whom are exceptionally well-qualified for the positions they hold. \xc2\xa0And they are coordinating closely with our South Korean counterparts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken are prudent, and they include, on missile defense, to enhance both the homeland and allied security, and others actions like the B-2 and B-52 flights, have been important steps to reassure our allies, demonstrate our resolve to the North, and reduce pressure on Seoul to take unilateral action. \xc2\xa0And we believe this has reduced the chance of miscalculation and provocation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI would also note -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this consistently, as have other officials -- that this pattern of bellicose rhetoric is not new, it is familiar. \xc2\xa0And we take it very seriously. \xc2\xa0We take prudent measures in response to it. \xc2\xa0But it is consistent with past behavior.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tDan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0So just to follow on that -- the fact that this has been going on for quite some time, this kind of rhetoric from North Korea, and that no assets have been moved around that you can tell, is there then the sense that this is more of Kim Jong-un trying to establish his reputation than it is anything else behind the threat?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would reiterate that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen action to back up the rhetoric in the sense that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen significant changes, as I said, in the North in terms of mobilizations or repositioning of forces, and that is important to note. \xc2\xa0And what that disconnect between the rhetoric and action means, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to the analysts to judge. \xc2\xa0We simply evaluate it and take necessary precautionary measures, and make clear to North Korea, together with our allies that this provocation behavior, provocative rhetoric only isolates them further; brings them no closer to rejoining the international community of nations -- in fact, moves them farther away from that potential and possibility.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we take steps necessary to make sure that we can protect ourselves and our allies, and we judge both -- we assess the rhetoric and we look very closely at what is happening on the ground.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On immigration -- does the President consider comprehensive immigration reform a legacy item, as one of his former top advisors, David Axelrod, said on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d over the weekend?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President views comprehensive immigration reform as a priority for the nation. \xc2\xa0It is something that is necessary because it will be good for our economy; it will be good for our businesses; it will be good for the middle class. \xc2\xa0And it has been a pursuit, obviously, that both Democrats and Republicans have engaged in for some time now that, at various periods, has enjoyed bipartisan support, this being one of those periods. \xc2\xa0And the President is focused on working with Congress to get this very important piece of business done on behalf of the American people and the American economy. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s his priority. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll note that in our approach to this -- and we discussed this early on about the reasons behind it -- we have made clear that we would like to see bipartisan action taken in Congress for legislation to emerge from the Senate, in this case, or in Congress, that\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan, that has the support of both Democrats and Republicans, that\xe2\x80\x99s written by both Democrats and Republicans, because that allows for the best opportunity for legislation to become law -- legislation that fits the principles the President has put forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThese kinds of big things always require bipartisan action. \xc2\xa0There are ups and downs in the makeup of the House and the Senate and the party leadership of each body over the years. \xc2\xa0But, in general, it is usually the case that for big things to get done it requires bipartisan effort, and this is one of those instances.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we have -- the President is absolutely serious about this. \xc2\xa0He has made clear that he is encouraged by the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made in the Senate, and wants to see it continue and to produce a result. \xc2\xa0But he is absolutely confident that the approach we have taken of having the Senate Group of Eight move forward with bipartisan negotiations and hopefully legislation has been the right approach.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the prosecutor shootings, has the President been briefed at all on it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly sure he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s been specifically briefed on that, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one more thing. \xc2\xa0We at CNN and others have reported that Caroline Kennedy will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s pick to be ambassador of Japan. \xc2\xa0Is she -- what qualifications does she have to put her in a position to deal with some of the tough issues in the region, in particular North Korea?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I have no personnel announcements to make, and I have seen no reporting that sources supposed personnel decisions to anyone on the record, from the White House or the administration. \xc2\xa0So I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnn.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Jay. \xc2\xa0On Wednesday, why is the President going to a police academy in Denver to talk about gun violence so close to -- a couple miles from the Aurora theater? \xc2\xa0Is he trying to -- does he worry that the violent incidents not only at Aurora, Colorado but in Newtown will fade in importance and urgency for both Congress and state legislatures?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think those of you who were here last week -- on Thursday, I believe it was -- heard the President speak passionately about the need to move forward on legislation that would reduce gun violence, as well as the entire package of proposals the President announced back in January. \xc2\xa0And he had with him family members of victims of gun violence, including from, I believe, Aurora as well as Virginia Tech and Newtown. \xc2\xa0And he made that point very clear, that we -- shame on us if just 100 days after Newtown the memory of that would not still be vivid enough to compel us to act, and the same holds true for Aurora. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, the President will travel to the Denver area, as you noted, on Wednesday, and he will there continue to ask the American people to join him in calling on Congress to pass these common-sense measures. \xc2\xa0He will also meet with local law enforcement officials and community leaders to discuss the new measures that the state of Colorado has recently put in place, including closing loopholes in the background check system to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have access to them.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I think this is -- since that\xe2\x80\x99s one piece of what he\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing in the Denver area, it\xe2\x80\x99s, again, important to note, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for your viewers and readers to understand, that closing loopholes in the background check system is, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, something that is supported by over 90 percent of the American people, by over 80 percent of gun owners, by Democrats, Republicans, independents, unaffiliated, completely un-political -- all types -- Americans across the board from every region of the country. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that there is an existing background check system. \xc2\xa0What needs to be done is action that improves that system, that closes loopholes to an existing system. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about creating something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist yet. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about refining and improving it to ensure that those who should not have weapons cannot obtain them. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd this is something that the American people overwhelmingly support. \xc2\xa0It is something that we believe the Congress should act on. \xc2\xa0All of these measures should have a vote. \xc2\xa0Those families the President was with deserve that Congress vote on these measures and not hide behind filibusters.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President watch the Louisville-Duke game yesterday? \xc2\xa0And did he reach out to Kevin Ware or --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I am not aware of whether he watched that game or not, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations to read out to you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBill.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you talked to the President since his basketball experience this morning? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What are you saying? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you if the President has confessed that he feels badly about missing so many shots?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I have not spoken to him about that, but the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get to practice probably as much as he\xe2\x80\x99d like to. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Having done a few shoot-arounds with him, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a pretty good shot -- pretty good shot.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s got a basketball court right out there to play.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Yes, well, these are busy times.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So on immigration, is he planning to keep his distance from the Gang of Eight so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be influencing, trying to -- \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it that way. \xc2\xa0I would say that we, as I noted earlier, are engaged at a staff level with those who are drafting legislation. \xc2\xa0I think the fact that the principles that are evident in the President\xe2\x80\x99s blueprint are reflected in the direction being taken by the Group of Eight says something about both the consensus that has emerged and the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on this issue. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut it is also the case that we believe, as a matter of strategy, that it should be -- the best course -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve said this all along -- was not for the President to drop his bill, proposed bill at the outset, but to let and encourage the Senate to move forward in a bipartisan way to try to craft its own legislation. \xc2\xa0Because his interest is in getting this done and getting it done in a way that keeps true to his principles, principles that are reflected in the efforts underway in the Senate, but also in the bipartisan efforts of the past that had the support of President George W. Bush and others, as well as then-Senator Obama.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the progress being made. \xc2\xa0And we encourage -- we urge, rather, the Senate to continue to move forward. \xc2\xa0And hopefully the words of Senators Graham, Flake, and Schumer reflect that that progress will continue and that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see legislation fairly soon.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It just looks like you may be hanging back so Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t have a target here.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it that way at all. \xc2\xa0I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that if the process stalls in Congress, we are prepared to move forward with proposing the President\xe2\x80\x99s bill -- our own legislation, but that the preferred path here is the path that is being taken and traveled along quite quickly, or relatively quickly, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the process that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen underway in the Senate in particular.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes. \xc2\xa0And then Ed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A follow-up on that point. \xc2\xa0Senator Graham, I believe over the weekend, said that once the bill is unveiled next week, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need the President\xe2\x80\x99s help to get it passed. \xc2\xa0So given the kind of observation of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s role has been -- the preferred letting the process work its will in the Senate -- how do you envision that changing starting next week, assuming the bill is unveiled? \xc2\xa0Can you sort of describe the differences between the current -- whatever the current situation is and what you see going forward?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the emergence of legislation. \xc2\xa0We hope that takes place and --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But assuming it does, though, what --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to assume that. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99ll still address your point, and that is to say that the President will continue to be out there urging action on comprehensive immigration reform, making clear what his principles and priorities are. \xc2\xa0We will continue to work with legislators in the process of both drafting and then pushing for legislation, assuming that it -- or hoping that it keeps with the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles, and what the process produces is a bill that the President could sign and that could get substantial bipartisan support.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think that we have chosen a path that makes a lot of sense, which is having -- giving room for the Senate to make progress in a bipartisan way on this legislation. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody should be under any illusion that we would not be where we are today, making the progress that we have made, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the fact that the President has made clear, consistently and very publicly as well as privately in conversation with rank-and-file members and leaders in Congress, that this is a top priority for the country and that -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why his blueprint, his views on comprehensive immigration reform have been out there and public for quite some time. \xc2\xa0So this is a cooperative effort I think that involves more than one leader, requires bipartisan action in Congress, but we are very much engaged.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But assuming that it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he can support -- obviously, it would be different if it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be -- but assuming that, he fully embraces it and -- or are there --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, before we know what \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x9d is, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the process. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by -- you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a done deal?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve been around long enough to know that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make that assumption. \xc2\xa0But the fact is there has been significant progress and we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by that. \xc2\xa0And we will assess the legislation when it emerges, and we certainly hope that\xe2\x80\x99s relatively soon. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEd, sorry.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Easter Mass. \xc2\xa0The President brought his family over to St. John\xe2\x80\x99s, as a lot of Republican and Democratic Presidents have. \xc2\xa0But was he surprised, were you surprised that the Reverend Le\xc3\xb3n decided to get so political and attack leaders of the religious right, at one point saying that they want, quote, \xe2\x80\x9cblacks to be back in the back of the bus.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It seemed sort of odd for Easter. \xc2\xa0Were you surprised by that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there and I have not spoken with the President. \xc2\xa0I know that he enjoys going to Easter services with his family. \xc2\xa0And in keeping with a tradition that dates back many presidencies, he went right across the park here to St. John\xe2\x80\x99s and attended those services.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s been noted that Reverend Le\xc3\xb3n has been there for quite some time. \xc2\xa0He has -- I think he gave the invocation at President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s second inaugural. \xc2\xa0So, again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a characterization to make of his comments. The President was just attending Easter services with his family.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He did speak at President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural, and also did the benediction at President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s most recent inaugural and said something about loving thy neighbor, et cetera. \xc2\xa0Do you think this kind of language, though, changes the tone in a positive way?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, this is -- he is not a politician. This is not a senator or a member of Congress or the President. \xc2\xa0This was a sermon that the -- at a church here that\xe2\x80\x99s been visited by Presidents of both parties for many, many years. \xc2\xa0And I think -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on it for you. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, thank you. \xc2\xa0Do you expect the President\xe2\x80\x99s deficit reduction plans on chained CPI, Medicare beneficiaries might be part of his budget that he releases next week?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I won\xe2\x80\x99t get ahead of the release of the budget. \xc2\xa0I want to make that a fun and full experience for all of you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So I would set that aside.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe items that you referred to were part of the offer the President made to Speaker Boehner during the fiscal cliff negotiations -- the offer that I think was widely viewed accurately as meeting Republicans at least halfway on revenue and spending cuts, including cuts from entitlements -- or savings from entitlement reforms. \xc2\xa0And that offer remains on the table, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear repeatedly since then.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo if even prior to the 10th of the month, if Congress were to miraculously reconvene and want to take action on that offer, the offer stands.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also, can you talk about what you hope and expect will come out of the President\xe2\x80\x99s dinner with lawmakers next week?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President looks forward to continuing the conversation that he\xe2\x80\x99s been having with groups of lawmakers, individual lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats. \xc2\xa0This would be the second dinner that he will have had with Republican senators. The President asked Senator Isakson to build a guest list for it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on that. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President looks forward to continuing this conversation, to seeing if common ground can be found and where it can be found on the pressing issues of the day, and that includes budget and fiscal issues. \xc2\xa0It also includes immigration reform and gun violence legislation; how we need to move forward, as the President spoke about on Friday in Miami, on investing in infrastructure for our economy\xe2\x80\x99s future as well as for its present, in terms of job creation; what we need to do to make ourselves more independent when it comes to our sources of energy. \xc2\xa0These are all priorities that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward and will discuss with those senators who attend at the next dinner. \xc2\xa0He looks forward to it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tPeter.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, right now we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of the public comment phase --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Does anybody have a score on Red Sox or Nationals? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Nationals are winning. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Second pitch of the season.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yankees 8-0. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Sorry.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What are you doing? \xc2\xa0Come on. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that to me. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m from New York, originally.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does anybody know Yankees-Red Sox?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Zero-zero.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Zero-zero. \xc2\xa0Thank you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not that anybody was distracted from the riveting conversation that is the briefing during a ballgame. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith the public comment phase now underway in terms of the draft of the environmental impact statement as it relates to the Keystone Pipeline, I was trying to get a sense -- without any specific scheduling announcements -- when we think we should expect to hear from the President on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, the process, as you know, is run out of the State Department. \xc2\xa0The timetable depends on that process, and I would refer you to the State Department for what those next steps are and when that process plays out. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything -- there is nothing -- I can promise you there is nothing on the President\'s schedule that relates to that question at this time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Understood. \xc2\xa0Then given just a couple of days ago, I guess Saturday, the EPA classified a new leak that took place in Arkansas with several thousand gallons of crude oil spilling from a ruptured Exxon-Mobil pipeline in that state, the EPA describing it as a "major spill." \xc2\xa0I\'m just curious the President\'s thoughts on that and, as they relate to considerations right now, even if not immediate, on that topic.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t spoken about this incident with the President. \xc2\xa0We obviously have a system in place where the EPA in this case is the federal on-scene coordinator when you have a spill, an event like this. \xc2\xa0And they are working with and have been working with state and local officials, as well as the responsible party, as they respond to this incident; in this case, the responsible party is Exxon-Mobil.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe obviously take the safety of our many pipelines in this country very seriously. \xc2\xa0And we have an agency that is dedicated to the task of making sure that those pipelines operate safely, and, in cases like these that -- investigations are undertaken and steps taken to both mitigate the damage and hopefully avoid them in the future.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMara.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0Without asking you to comment on any impending personnel announcements, can you talk in a general way of the President\'s opinions of Caroline Kennedy\'s talents and abilities?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But it was worth trying.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJon-Christopher.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In these challenging and rather precarious times with North Korea, we understand that Kim Jong-un has disconnected the so-called "red phone." \xc2\xa0If the President could speak directly to the leader of North Korea, what would he say to him today?</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, I think the President and the administration judge the rhetoric and actions by the North Korean regime for what they are -- actions and rhetoric that further isolate the regime, that demonstrate a repeated preference for bellicosity rather than tending to the needs of the North Korean people who suffer greatly under a regime that prioritizes nuclear weapons and missile programs over the welfare of their own people. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd it has been our position, as well as the position of our allies, that North Korea needs to abide by its international obligations; it needs to do so in order to end its isolation and to better serve its people. \xc2\xa0Because this kind of rhetoric does not benefit the North Korean people, it does not benefit the North Korean regime, and it only isolates them further. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAlexis.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, the President later this week will be traveling wearing his partisan hat at his party to do some fundraising. \xc2\xa0Can you describe how the President decided how much he would participate in doing that, especially in the context of a week in which he\'s going to be trying to build bipartisan support for his agenda, but going out to try to raise money to defeat Republicans?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think he\'s going to be raising money to try to elect people who he believes share his agenda and his priorities. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with actions taken by past presidents -- I know it is -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what he will be doing. \xc2\xa0But I think he will be out there talking about the things that he believes we need to do to move the country forward. \xc2\xa0And he both welcomes the bipartisan progress we\'ve seen on some issues, like comprehensive immigration reform, and is engaged in conversations with Republican lawmakers as well as Democrats to try to foster more bipartisan cooperation to get the work of the American people done. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd it is simply a fact, as I was saying earlier, that in the world we live in now, no midterm election, or even presidential-year election, is going to change the absolute fact that to get important things done, we need bipartisan cooperation. \xc2\xa0And that, I predict at great risk, will be the case two years from now just as it today, regardless of who wins what races in 2014. \xc2\xa0Because that -- to do the kinds of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- immigration reform, actions to reduce gun violence, enhancing our energy independence while improving our environment -- these are things that almost all require bipartisan cooperation, and that\'s what the President is focused on.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And to follow up, sequestration impact in the Executive Office of the President -- can you give us some data?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Let me see what I have for you here. \xc2\xa0As you know, the White House is one of 11 components of the Executive Office of the President, which is, indeed, as we have said, subject to the sequester. \xc2\xa0Within the Executive Office of the President, several offices have sent furlough notices to their staff, including to 480 employees of the Office of Management and Budget. \xc2\xa0In addition, EOP leadership has managed our personnel costs in a variety of ways, including hiring slowdowns and delayed backfilling of open positions. \xc2\xa0And as the impact of the sequester progresses, furlough and pay cuts remain possibilities -- or additional furloughs, as well as pay cuts, remain possibilities for additional White House employees.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAdditionally, in order to meet the effects of the sequester, many components of the EOP have significantly scaled back equipment purchases and supply purchases, curtailed staff travel, reduced the use of air cards. \xc2\xa0And they are reviewing contracts that they have on an ongoing basis to identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve efficiencies without undermining their core mission.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIt just means that all -- everybody at the White House and the broader EOP is dealing with the consequences both -- in many cases, in their own personal lives, but in how we work here at the White House, which is true across the federal government because of the impact of the sequester.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up, because you can be so specific about the OMB impact, and we assume that federal employees get a 30-day notice if they are going to get a furlough notice, and the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re not identifying anybody who is working directly in the White House for the President as being identified to that, is that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The OMB works for the President. \xc2\xa0It is part of the Executive Office of the President.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, but we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the West Wing folks who work directly for the President. \xc2\xa0Those folks --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I just -- I completely take issue with the idea that the OMB doesn\'t --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are many hundreds of people who work for the President of the United States -- you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you. \xc2\xa0So my question is, because you haven\xe2\x80\x99t identified those people who have received any furlough notices, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that cost-effective shifting of dollars and holding down on dollars is for the time being going to prevent anybody from being furloughed? \xc2\xa0That\'s what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think I just said that within the Executive Office of the President, a component of that, OMB, there have been 480 employees who have been notified of furloughs.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but you don\'t work for OMB. \xc2\xa0So --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, but they work for the President, and so do I. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You know exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\'t. \xc2\xa0I don\'t.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- okay, the White House --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are those the only furlough notices or are there others?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no other notices to announce to you. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why not?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0As I just said, as the impact of the sequester progresses, furlough and pay cuts remain possibilities for additional White House employees. \xc2\xa0I think you would find at agency after agency, as they make these assessments and make these budget decisions on a rolling basis, they\'re having to make decisions about furlough notices and other measures that they have to take, and that is as true here as it is in other federal agencies.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, why can OMB give us a number of 480 and none of the other components --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that that\'s the number I have for EOP, and it\xe2\x80\x99s 480 at OMB.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the other 10 components, there is no furlough notices at this point?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, that\'s what I have for you, Donovan. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any other furlough notices to announce to you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there haven\xe2\x80\x99t been any?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That\'s what I have, not beyond what I can tell you. \xc2\xa0That\'s what I know.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tStephen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Previously, in times of tension with North Korea, the administration has communicated directly with Pyongyang through various diplomatic channels, including the U.N. \xc2\xa0Has that happened in the recent weeks?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, we have -- obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s been action at the U.N. with our allies at the Security Council, a resolution that passed unanimously with support from both China and Russia, as well as others. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any specific communications with the North Koreans to convey to you. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that they know what the position is that we hold and that our allies hold in terms of both provocative actions and bellicose rhetoric, on the one hand, and then what steps they could take and what they need to do to reduce their isolation and improve the lot of their people.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that message has been fully communicated.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the White House -- can you tell us anything about White House contact with China? \xc2\xa0Has there been specific communications with the Chinese government on this?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you that, in general, whenever we have conversations with the Chinese government and our counterparts, depending on which official we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, North Korea is frequently a topic. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a specific conversation to provide to you, but that is -- when we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing with our Chinese counterparts areas of national security matters, including North Korea, this comes up frequently. \xc2\xa0So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if that\'s been the case. But I don\'t -- maybe State has something more for you, but I don\'t have anything specific.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0Given the ratcheting up of the tensions on North Korea, can I ask one more? \xc2\xa0Although, you\xe2\x80\x99ve hit many of your main points. \xc2\xa0Does U.S. support encompass what we understand was a briefing for the South Korean President, which included plans or a proposal to launch a preemptive strike against the North should what they call an imminent nuclear or a missile attack be detected? \xc2\xa0Does U.S. support encompass that kind of --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of such a briefing. \xc2\xa0We obviously have a very close relationship with the Republic of Korea and with the government there, and we have taken measures that I think I noted were designed to be both reassuring to our allies in the region and to make it clear that unilateral action is not necessary. \xc2\xa0And we continue to work with not just the South Koreans but other allies in the region on this important matter, and to make clear what the actions we\xe2\x80\x99re taking are; what our view is of the rhetoric emanating from North Korea. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that as this goes on.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For the changing of the North Korean regime -- and North Korean behavior through the years, does South Korea have any preemptive strike against the North Korea?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think I just answered that. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t have anything beyond to say that we have a very close relationship with the Republic of Korea; that we have taken some of the actions -- the prudent measures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken both on missile defense and with regards to flights by B-2 and B-52 aircraft designed to reassure our allies, to demonstrate our resolve to the North, and reduce pressure on Seoul to take unilateral action. \xc2\xa0In total, this, we believe, has reduced the chance of miscalculation and provocation in this arena.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you suggest, though, a warning to North Korea -- or the time that could demonstrate -- the bombing to whatever -- airplane strikes. \xc2\xa0Why not -- a preemptive strike to the North Korea?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Why not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. \xc2\xa0I don\'t understand. \xc2\xa0Why not what?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why not the strike to bombing North Korea?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t think that\'s a serious question, so I will -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at the answer I gave. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThank you. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t1:37 P.M.
