Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:36 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back.\xc2\xa0 I hope everyone here had a fantastic Thanksgiving, had a chance to spend some time with family, and is well rested and ready to get back to work, as I am.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Psych yourself up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not wanting to overtax myself on this day back, I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so I\'ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 First on Europe.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a growing fear that the euro is in a particularly perilous state, perhaps poised to collapse within days.\xc2\xa0 Is that the White House view?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, our position is and has been that it\'s critical for Europe to move with force and decisiveness now, particularly with new governments coming into place in Italy, Greece and Spain.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that this is a European issue, that Europe has the resources and capacity to deal with it, and that they need to act decisively and conclusively to resolve this problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe obviously have a great deal of expertise and experience in these matters, and we have been in regular consultation with our counterparts from various European governments, consulting with them, offering the advice and expertise that we have to assist them.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to believe that Europe has the capacity to deal with this, and that they will, conclusively.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of commitments, if any, is the President seeking today on this issue from the European leaders?\xc2\xa0 And is he confident that they have the requisite sense of urgency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President has been and will continue to be in regular contact with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, as well as others.\xc2\xa0 The meeting today is a regular summit, an annual summit, with the EU.\xc2\xa0 It was held here two years ago, was held in Lisbon last year -- it rotates.\xc2\xa0 And this will be -- obviously, the global economic situation and, in particular, the situation in Europe will be one of the topics of conversation.\xc2\xa0 There will be other issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President will reflect in his conversations in the meeting today what I\'ve just said to you here, which is that the United States believes that Europe needs to take decisive action, conclusive action, to handle this problem, and that it has the capacity to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question for you on Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the President\'s personal reaction was upon learning of the NATO strikes that apparently killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, and also whether the White House is fearful that this will harm the U.S.-Pakistani relationship, as many people outside the building have been saying?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\'s reaction is all of our reaction, which is that the events that took those lives -- the event, rather, was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0 The loss of Pakistani life was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0 We mourn the brave Pakistani service members who lost their lives.\xc2\xa0 And our sympathies go out to their families and go out to Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe take this matter very seriously.\xc2\xa0 I believe my colleague over at the Pentagon, George Little, announced earlier today that in addition to ISAF looking into this, at the request of General Allen, CENTCOM will be investigating this matter.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very keen on finding out exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for our relationship with Pakistan, it continues to be an important, cooperative relationship that is also very complicated.\xc2\xa0 And we have been -- senior U.S. officials have been in contact with the Pakistani government, with their counterparts in Pakistan, including Secretaries Panetta and Clinton, Chairman Dempsey, General Allen, Ambassador Munter.\xc2\xa0 And those contacts will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is very much in America\xe2\x80\x99s national security interest to maintain a cooperative relationship with Pakistan, because we have shared interests in the fight against terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And so we will continue to work on that relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Pakistan, have any senior White House officials been in touch with people in Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to anybody?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no contacts at the presidential level to report and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe anybody in the White House has been.\xc2\xa0 But as I said, some of the most senior members on the national security team for this administration have been, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure those contacts will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess a lot of people are fearing that this is at crisis levels, the tensions between the United States and Pakistan over this incident.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how you would characterize it in terms of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we take it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And there are challenges to this relationship, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed them here this year.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a significant issue that we take seriously, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we, through CENTCOM, will be investigating to find out exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0 And our condolences go out to the families of those who lost their lives, and to the Pakistani people overall, for this tragedy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe continue to believe that it will be in not just the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest, but Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s interest, to work with us cooperatively on our shared goals.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that Pakistan and the Pakistani people have been primary victims of terrorism and terrorists, and that we work with them and that cooperative relationship has borne fruit for the United States and for our national security interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Europe, how worried is the President about the impact on the U.S. economy as this crisis fully intensifies and as people predict maybe only days left to save the euro?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is concerned, as he\xe2\x80\x99s expressed, about the fact that we -- this is a global economy and that the events in Europe obviously have an impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s created a headwind for much of the year, and continues to create that headwind.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in the United States\' interest, but, most obviously, in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s interest to act decisively to deal with this profound challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt does remind all of us that we need to take decisive action on the things that we can control.\xc2\xa0 And one of those things we can do is take action on measures that can grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Senate this week is going to take up a provision that the President put forward to expand -- to rather extend and expand the payroll tax cut for\xc2\xa0 160 million Americans, and extend it to small businesses up to a certain level of payroll.\xc2\xa0 And he believes very strongly that we need to take that action; that Congress needs to act to do the right thing by the American people and the American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Tell me again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julia Edwards, National Journal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, Julia.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan was to see that unemployment insurance was extended to the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 I hear a lot of focus on payroll tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Is that because it\xe2\x80\x99s more politically advantageous to be talking about what you can do for working Americans versus something that may be construed as welfare?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Extending unemployment insurance has been very much a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan.\xc2\xa0 It was part of the American Jobs Act as something that has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, and should, we hope, enjoy bipartisan support this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to being vital to those who have found themselves unemployed and are unemployed for a substantial period of time, unemployment insurance has been recognized by outside economists and by members of both parties as vital assistance to an economy to help it grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 It is a direct injection, if you will, into the bloodstream of the economy.\xc2\xa0 And so we very much support extension of unemployment insurance.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we do not do that, approximately 6 million Americans will lose their benefits over the course of next year, and that will obviously have very negative impact on their lives, but a negative impact on the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- forward then would be most likely to be combining unemployment insurance in a package at the end of the year, if Congress doesn\'t take action on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to speculate about how this will play out.\xc2\xa0 What the President is focused on, and what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about in Scranton on Wednesday, is the need for Congress to take action, for the Senate to vote yes to the extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut and to the extension of the payroll tax cut to small businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is something that outside economists have made clear -- just this year alone, the 2 percent payroll tax cut that 160 million Americans have gotten this year that that has resulted in $1,000 on average in every recipient\xe2\x80\x99s wallet this year, has caused up to 1 percent in GDP growth.\xc2\xa0 Take that away and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to shrink the economy and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to cause the economy to shrink -- to grow less, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do a lot of harm to 160 million working Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s payroll tax cuts --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On unemployment insurance, is that something we can expect to hear him talk about this week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You will hear us talk about it because we think it\xe2\x80\x99s vitally important to extend it and to assist those Americans who are unemployed, and to -- through the unemployment insurance, to assist the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on a couple questions that have already been asked.\xc2\xa0 On Pakistan -- the President is not making any conclusions about what happened.\xc2\xa0 It may, in fact, be that the Pakistanis fired first.\xc2\xa0 The President is keeping an open mind about what may have happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we want to -- obviously we want to wait to see what the investigation discovers, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then in terms of what\'s going on in Europe, you said that this is a European issue, Europe has the resources and capacity to deal with it.\xc2\xa0 But President Obama said recently that this is a problem of political will.\xc2\xa0 And I guess I wonder, you didn\'t say Europe has the political will to deal with this.\xc2\xa0 Do you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been very clear both publicly and in his conversations with European leaders that they need to demonstrate the will to deal with this very challenging problem.\xc2\xa0 We recognize that this is difficult.\xc2\xa0 We experienced similar difficulties in tackling the challenges that we faced in this country as we were in freefall, economically, in the beginning of 2009, shedding jobs at a terrible pace, and where the prospect of global economic collapse was out there.\xc2\xa0 And so the President fully understands the challenges here, both political and substantive.\xc2\xa0 But he believes this is a moment that requires that kind of decisive action.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, that requires political will as well as the financial resources necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he doing, other than these occasional conversations with European leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say they\'re not occasional. I mean, if there are the two leaders he\'s spoken with more often than Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy in recent weeks and months, I don\'t know who they are.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they\'re regular.\xc2\xa0 We read them out regularly.\xc2\xa0 He\'s in consultation, obviously, with other European allies.\xc2\xa0 Tim Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, is in regular contact and has traveled frequently to Europe, and other counterparts have been involved as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re very engaged in this.\xc2\xa0 We have, because of our experience, our unique experience, I think, some very constructive help that we can offer and advice that we can offer. But we also recognize, and I think Europeans feel strongly about this, that this is something that they need to solve and that they have the capacity to solve -- both the financial capacity and political will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, I wanted to get your feedback on a study that the Wall Street Journal wrote about today, based on -- my understanding, based at least partly on numbers tabulated by our unofficial statistician, Mr. Norwick, which is that President Obama seems to have traveled to battleground states more so than any other President before him.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you could respond to this.\xc2\xa0 It looks like the President is campaigning on the taxpayer dime more than any other President has done.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I reject the premise of that precisely because what happened in 2008 was Barack Obama, then-Senator Obama, expanded the political map dramatically.\xc2\xa0 And what is included in this article, and in this chart, is Virginia, for example.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, every President who\'s occupied the Oval Office, just a few short minutes across the river from Virginia, travels to Virginia frequently to hold events.\xc2\xa0 When you look at George W. Bush\'s travel as President, that\'s not included on this list as a swing state or a battleground state because it was not perceived to be possible that a Democrat could win it.\xc2\xa0 But Barack Obama won that state, and he\'s made numerous visits to Virginia, just as most Presidents prior to Barack Obama have made numerous visits to Virginia.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorth Carolina is another example.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not included in George W. Bush\'s tabulation because it was not perceived to be a swing state.\xc2\xa0 Barack Obama won it -- very narrowly, but he won it in 2008.\xc2\xa0 And if you take away those two states, and you look at, for example, Bush traveled more frequently in the same time period to Ohio, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Florida, President Obama has actually traveled less to the overlay battleground states than his immediate predecessor.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I just think that, if you took off the map and said, the President of the United States can\'t travel to states that are perceived to be battleground states, you would severely limit the capacity of this President and any of his successors to travel anywhere.\xc2\xa0 Because the fact is, we live in a country that is very close, politically, in terms of which way states could go in any given presidential election.\xc2\xa0 And increasingly, we\'ve seen that more and more states find themselves on the political map as potential battleground states and swing states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if every President, whether it\'s President Obama or his successor, or any successor after that, were to simply say, oh, I can\'t travel to any state that might be contested in the next election, then the President would have to spend most of his time here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that any President should do that.\xc2\xa0 Presidents should travel, and they should be able to get out and speak to the American people about their substantive agendas, and that\'s what this President has been doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He sure seems to spend a lot of time in states, though, that he\'s going to be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He spends a lot of time in a lot of states.\xc2\xa0 And some of them, red, blue; some of them were declared red forever and ended up not being -- they\'re purple now; and states that maybe are considered blue or were considered blue but Republicans might think they have a chance of winning next year. I mean, I just think that it\'s a guessing game to suggest that we know what states are battleground states, necessarily.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if -- again, I think the salient point is, then-Senator Obama and his presidential campaign expanded the map dramatically, made states battleground states that had not been for a very, very long time.\xc2\xa0 And to then say that he can\'t travel to those states because he won them and made them competitive I think would severely restrict this President\'s ability to travel, and any future President\'s ability to travel, which I don\'t think is a good idea.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow-up, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You earned the right.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir, Mr. Knoller.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how it\'s decided where events, like the President going to Scranton on Wednesday, how is that decided that\'s where he would go?\xc2\xa0 I mean, Pennsylvania is a state that seems to me would be indispensable to his reelection, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I think as you know probably better than, or as well as anybody in this room, a lot of factors go into presidential travel.\xc2\xa0 Proximity has a lot to do with it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there is a concentration of travel in states like Virginia and Pennsylvania because they\xe2\x80\x99re close by.\xc2\xa0 And if the President is trying to get out of Washington and communicate with the American voter, he can\xe2\x80\x99t -- or the American people, rather -- he can\xe2\x80\x99t always go to the mountain states or the plain states or the West Coast.\xc2\xa0 And so I think you do see a concentration in this time zone.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m very confident -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll offer my opinion -- that President Obama is going to win Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also going to win the election.\xc2\xa0 I think he won Pennsylvania by double digits, but that\xe2\x80\x99s now, I guess by your estimation or whoever put together this list, a battleground state.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it is, maybe it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t take anything for granted.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point is, is that these are subjective assessments, and again, if you decided that every state that was close or could be close were ruled out as a potential place for a President to travel, you would make it really, really difficult for any President to go anywhere in the country eventually.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that politics played no role in the decision, are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that -- I mean, there are a lot of decisions that go into -- a lot of factors that go into the decisions.\xc2\xa0 And official events are made for official reasons.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re made because we find places where the President can talk about the policy proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward that makes sense for a variety of reasons -- logistical reasons, as well as location in terms of schools or sites that if we\xe2\x80\x99re highlighting his infrastructure proposals, then near a bridge, for example, or highlighting his proposals to help veterans, something that would involve veterans, or schools.\xc2\xa0 I mean, all of those factors go into deciding where the President travels.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll the way in the back, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the payroll tax cut and the risk to the jobs package, given that the Republicans are going to block any tax increases, is the President open to negotiating additional long-term spending cuts in return for that short-term stimulus?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is very interested in making sure that 160 million Americans, working Americans who get a paycheck don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes raised next year because Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t act.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, is that a payroll tax cut has been supported by not just Democrats, not just this President, but by Republicans in the not-too-distant past, including some who came out against it yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we believe that there is substantial support out in the country among not just Democrats and independents, but Republicans, for an extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut as well as an extension to small businesses, and that there is broad support for paying for it in the way that the President put forward in his principles, in his plan, and that the Senate is going to put forward later this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, if Republicans are going to vote against this, they have to explain why.\xc2\xa0 They have so energetically fought to protect tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires -- protected millionaires and billionaires rather than funding a program that would have sent teachers back to work, protected millionaires and billionaires rather than funding a program as part of the American Jobs Act that would have put construction workers on the job to rebuild bridges and highways and schools, protected millionaires and billionaires rather than pass the entire American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 Now, they did that with great passion.\xc2\xa0 But they don\'t seem to have -- show a lot of passion when it comes to extending a tax break for average Americans.\xc2\xa0 And I think there needs to be some questioning about why that is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they do want spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 The things that they want are spending cuts and they want to change the defense sequester, which you\'ve said is off the table, I guess, for these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Is spending cuts something that you would be willing to negotiate --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to negotiate an outcome that we don\'t believe should come to pass.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Congress should respond to the will of the people, which overwhelmingly supports the President\'s proposal for a payroll tax cut extension and expansion and the means by which both the President and Senate Democrats believe it should be paid for.\xc2\xa0 So rather than get ahead of a vote that we believe will happen later this week, I\'d like to see everybody in the Senate held accountable in voting one way or the other on this proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Pakistan\'s prime minister tells CNN that there will be "no more business as usual" in Pakistan-U.S. relations.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering what do you take that to mean and how much stock do you put in what sounds like a threat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we take the matter very seriously, as I\'ve said earlier, and we understand the concern that members of the Pakistani government as well as the Pakistani people have about this incident.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re very interested in having it investigated and finding out exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0 We mourn, as I said, the loss of life and we extend our condolences to the Pakistani people for it.\xc2\xa0 So we take it very seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But "no more business as usual" is obviously an indication of things souring--</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We understand that this is a serious issue.\xc2\xa0 We take it seriously.\xc2\xa0 We have a relationship with Pakistan that has been complicated for a long time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also an important relationship and one that we need to work hard on because that cooperation is in the interest of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the calls for Justices Thomas and Kagan to recuse themselves from overseeing the health care challenge, any response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say that I believe -- my understanding of how this works is that it\'s up to each justice to decide whether he or she should be recused.\xc2\xa0 Just speaking of Justice Kagan, because obviously this President nominated her and that confirmation process occurred just last year and we all either participated in it or witnessed it, these issues were raised just a year ago in an expansive confirmation hearing, and they were -- these questions were asked and answered both in the hearing itself and in written questions that were responded to in writing.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a mystery to me how this can suddenly be an issue a year later and they want to revisit what they just visited not that long ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Justice Kagan has said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I just said, all this stuff was examined, all of it was -- questions were asked, she answered it, and she responded in writing to this.\xc2\xa0 So I think it sure sounds like a political thing to try to revisit it just a year later.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the information that was in the email was not available during the confirmation hearings.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the payroll tax cut extension, will the President sign an extension that does not include a tax on millionaires to pay for it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to the Senate voting on the bill that Senate Democrats are putting forward that pays for an extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut in a way that Senate Democrats support, the President supports, Democrats, independents and Republicans support around the country -- Republicans support everywhere, apparently, except on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to move that conversation along --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Republicans will likely vote against it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to fail, and so it will likely end up in an omnibus --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, before we --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or continuing resolution.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the President going to back down and sign an extension of the payroll tax cut extension without --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate an endgame here before this vote has even happened.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to the American people to sort of just say, oh, well, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote against it, let\xe2\x80\x99s ignore that and move on and see what they might vote for.\xc2\xa0 Because here\xe2\x80\x99s what Senator McConnell said about the payroll tax cut in early 2009.\xc2\xa0 He suggested that we should have a two-year elimination of the payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt put a lot of money back in the hands of businesses and in the hands of individuals, both of whom pay the payroll tax cut.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator John Kyl, who had something else to say about it yesterday, said, in late 2009, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do some things to stimulate job creation, and certainly something like reducing the payroll tax cut, which has been written about recently, would accomplish that\xe2\x80\x9d -- job creation.\xc2\xa0 That must be a good thing, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator Hutchison: \xe2\x80\x9cI think the payroll tax cut does help some.\xc2\xa0 It helps the individual who is working, and the employer.\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Alexander, in late 2010, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re a small businessperson in Tennessee, what this means is that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be paying tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps more, in taxes.\xc2\xa0 And you can use that to create a job.\xc2\xa0 It also means that your employees who work there will get a one-third reduction in their payroll tax payments every two weeks, and maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll spend some -- more money creating more jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We couldn\'t have said it better.</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator Hatch called it a \xe2\x80\x9cconservative approach to help put our economy back on track; a targeted, reasonable way to get employers hiring again.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This is a conservative approach, as I said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, obviously these Republican senators believe that a pay roll tax cut is a good thing -- at least they did.\xc2\xa0 But what they seem not to believe is that millionaires and billionaires ought to pay a little extra in order to ensure that middle-class Americans get a payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re more -- forced to choose here.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re siding with those who -- as the CBO study showed and others have showed -- have done exceptionally well in the last 10 years, even 30 years, while middle-class Americans have seen their income stagnate.\xc2\xa0 We just don\'t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right position.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t think the American people support that position.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd before senators are forced to vote on that matter, as they will later this week, and explain why they\xe2\x80\x99d rather see taxes go up on regular Americans than see millionaires and billionaires pay a little bit more -- before we get beyond that, I want to see that vote happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just a quick question on Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Did the President make any calls on Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no calls to report out to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if NATO forces or American forces are fired on from Pakistani military bases, are they allowed to defend themselves?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a question best directed towards ISAF and to the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 I would say, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a question about this incident, that we are just beginning an investigation into what happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel.\xc2\xa0 I thought -- I didn\'t think the criticism was that the President should stop traveling -- obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s entitled to travel.\xc2\xa0 But as you make a fair point, that he\xe2\x80\x99s expanded the electoral map, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the criticism that the campaign and not the taxpayers should pay for it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but the suggestion is that he can\xe2\x80\x99t make official travel to any state that\xe2\x80\x99s considered contested or close.\xc2\xa0 And we just utterly reject that, because the President has a responsibility, as the President, as Commander-in-Chief, as well as the leader of the country on domestic matters, to go out and meet with Americans, to have events in different states across the country, and to express his --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- four or five states --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go there because it\xe2\x80\x99s close, and it was only close because --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He can go there, but maybe the campaign picks up the tab at some point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 And, again, take away those states that he happened to win against all odds and probably against the predictions of various new organizations, that he then -- it was okay for previous Presidents to go there, but not for him because he won so convincingly in 2008.\xc2\xa0 That just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why does he go to North Carolina so many more times than he goes to Tennessee.\xc2\xa0 Why does he go to Pennsylvania so many more times than he goes to Georgia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, there are a variety of reasons -- of the decisions are made about where he goes -- and he goes to red states, he goes to blue states, he goes to states that are considered battleground states -- and those decisions are made for substantive reasons based on the policy issue that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s addressing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy point was that if you -- that the whole construct of the article was built around the idea that he\xe2\x80\x99s done it more than his predecessors.\xc2\xa0 And if you take off states that weren\xe2\x80\x99t considered battlegrounds when Bush visited them and they turned out to be battlegrounds because Barack Obama won them -- his predecessor, George W. Bush, traveled to these states significantly more than President Obama has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the whole point being, Presidents need to be able to travel.\xc2\xa0 When he travels on -- when it\xe2\x80\x99s political travel, political events, those are paid for by the book according to the rules that exist.\xc2\xa0 And when he does official events, those are paid for in the manner that official events are paid for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing on the euro -- one quick one on the euro.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On which one?\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The euro.\xc2\xa0 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the U.S. is part of that research group -- essentially put out a report today saying that the euro contagion can spread and that their concern is that the policies in Europe but also in the U.S. are behind the curve.\xc2\xa0 Speaking about the U.S. side, since the President is talking to European leaders today about their debt issues, after the super committee failure it seems like both parties have said, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to fight these issues out on taxes and everything in the election.\xc2\xa0 Is the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t said that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So between now and the election, will the President campaign for his $3 trillion deficit plan?\xc2\xa0 Or is he just -- because he mostly goes out on the road and campaigns for the jobs bill, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t really hear him campaigning on the deficit plan.\xc2\xa0 So will he push that now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is an urgent need to take action to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly his number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 He put forward a detailed plan.\xc2\xa0 He talks about it a lot and he will talk about it again in the future.\xc2\xa0 And it remains available to Congress to take up and act on it at any time.\xc2\xa0 It is unfortunate that the super committee -- because, again, it refused to deal with or consider the Bush tax cuts or revenue in any substantial way -- that the super committee failed, because it allowed for a mechanism by which Congress could have acted more efficiently and quickly to deal with this long-term deficit and debt challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is nothing that prevents Congress from doing the right thing and taking up a balanced approach, the likes of which the President put forward in a 80-plus-page plan, and acting on it; and acting on it if not this month then next month, or January or February or March.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait until the election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a high priority, and the President -- it\xe2\x80\x99s funny, if you look at sort of the assessments that are made by outside observers and columnists and commentators and economists, they always say, what we really need, what this economy really needs is near-term -- measures to have a positive impact on the economy in the near term, to grow it and create jobs in the near term, and measures that deal with our medium- and long-term deficit and debt problems.\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has put forward proposals to deal with both.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly hopes that in addition to acting on the payroll tax cut and extension of UI, that Congress will see fit to continue to act on other measures, provisions within the jobs act, and he certainly hoped that Congress will take up his deficit and debt reduction plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Europe.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands called on the IMF to take a bigger role in the European debt crisis.\xc2\xa0 The United States is the largest shareholder in the IMF.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration support this idea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would just refer you to the things we said about -- questions about the IMF\'s role coming out of the G20, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, which is IMF has substantial resources; it can play a role on the side, if you will, or a part of this.\xc2\xa0 But the issue here is a European issue and Europe needs to act.\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve also said is that we do not in any way believe that additional resources are required from the United States, from American taxpayers.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today Representative Barney Frank is currently announcing his retirement from Congress.\xc2\xa0 As the longest-serving LGBT member of Congress and also a senior Democrat, what does the White House and the President think that this says both to the advancement of LGBT issues in Congress and also to the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 obvious desire to take back the House in 2012?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any official reaction yet, but Congressman Frank has served for a very long time and he\'s served very effectively representing his district, and I know that we appreciate his service.\xc2\xa0 And his prominence as an openly LGBT member of Congress obviously had I think a very positive impact in terms of general acceptance.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know if it has larger implications.\xc2\xa0 Members of Congress who\'ve served a long time decide not to run again all the time.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not sure about the political implications of that seat at all, but we certainly are very grateful for Congressman Frank\'s service.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the coming year, in the interest of transparency, would the President be willing to have each of the trips he takes domestically broken out for their cost that is covered by the White House and what parts are covered by the DNC?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can refer you to -- I can get back to you on who -- the DNC or how these things -- I know that we do this by the book the way it\'s supposed to be done.\xc2\xa0 We do it very carefully.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to stand here and announce a whole new administrative burden or agree to a whole new administrative burden.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the folks who handle this, especially at the DNC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no one has done that before.\xc2\xa0 Would he be willing to consider being the first?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not -- I can take the question but we do this absolutely by the book and are very assiduous in making sure that we follow the rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you use the same rules that President Bush did?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ll have to take that.\xc2\xa0 We use whatever rules exist and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you didn\xe2\x80\x99t change the rules?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the payroll tax cut just briefly, the House Republicans have suggested a willingness to work on this.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to sit down with them and try to figure out a pay-for that could work to get the payroll tax cut extension done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the nature of these questions basically assume and let off the hook those members of Congress who aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to say yes to a payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans because they refuse to ask the wealthiest Americans, those who have benefited enormously over the past 10, 20 and 30 years while the middle class has not benefited very much -- or as much -- to pay a little extra.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let\'s not presuppose that this vote will fail.\xc2\xa0 Maybe members of the Senate, in this case, will hear from their constituents, will recognize what all the data shows, which is that by large majorities the American people support this proposal and support the way the President believes it ought to be paid for, and the way Democrats believe it ought to be paid for, and enough of them will vote yes to overcome the usual filibuster because of parliamentary tactics and get it out of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And then the House will have to decide where it stands on this issue, which side the House is on and individual members of the House are on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond that, I don\'t want to negotiate an endgame that presupposes a failure that we hope won\'t happen.\xc2\xa0 We have put forward a means to pay for this payroll tax cut extension and expansion, as well as unemployment insurance -- the President has.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Democrats have done it as well.\xc2\xa0 We think that Congress ought to act on that before we start negotiating an endgame that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily come to pass.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Egyptian elections, is there any concern, even though they are just getting started today -- is there any concern about an Islamic takeover at the top and how the White House will work with a federal government headed by Islamists?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One is, thus far -- and this is a long process, as you know -- it\'s my understanding that the elections have gone well, and we welcome that development.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the democratic process is what\'s important.\xc2\xa0 Principles matter to this President, not parties.\xc2\xa0 And we hold whatever party prevails or is represented in the outcome of an election like this, whether it\'s in Egypt or elsewhere -- our standards have to do with respect for human rights, respect for the democratic process, denunciation of violence, and inclusion of and respect for minorities in the process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it is in some ways unfair to assume that any party that has a religious affiliation cannot adhere to democratic principles.\xc2\xa0 It\'s simply not the case and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been borne out by the facts.\xc2\xa0 So before we judge the disposition of a government -- or a parliament that\'s just beginning to take shape through elections that have started today, I think we need to let the process run its course, continue to espouse our firm support for democratic principles and for civilian control of the government, and then judge the outcome by the actions of those who prevail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Quick follow-up on both Scranton and today\'s EU summit.\xc2\xa0 Dan Pfeiffer had tweeted earlier today that there would be more "We Can\'t Wait" stuff this week.\xc2\xa0 When will that be rolled out?\xc2\xa0 In Scranton, or is the Scranton message purely on the payroll tax cut extension?\xc2\xa0 And if the former, can you put some meat on the bone?\xc2\xa0 And then with regard to the summit today, just to clarify -- is the President asking these EU leaders for anything explicit that he hasn\'t already spoken with Merkel and Sarkozy about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This meeting is going on now, so I don\'t want to say what happened before it\'s happened.\xc2\xa0 I think, generally, the description of the President\'s message that I gave is going to be the message that he delivers in this meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think it certainly is the case in the current crisis that Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy and other leaders of European countries are key to the process, and that\'s why the President has had so many direct conversations with them, and will continue to.\xc2\xa0 And obviously this meeting with the EU is important in that regard, too, but it will also discuss other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, on Wednesday, will focus on the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have any announcements beyond Dan\'s tweet to make about further executive actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTom.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Senator Kyl said yesterday that the reason that the payroll tax should not be extended and sweetened, as the President wants, is that that\'s millions of dollars more that won\'t go into the Social Security trust fund, therefore, it might conceivably endanger the stability of Social Security.\xc2\xa0 How do you all react to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, that\'s simply not the case, because it would -- it presupposes the idea that U.S. treasuries are not the most rock-solid investment in the world, which they remain to be -- which they remain even as we speak.\xc2\xa0 So, secondly, it\'s not a position that Senator Kyl took in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact of the matter is, we need to take measures to grow this economy.\xc2\xa0 We need to take measures to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And what we should not be doing is asking 160 million hardworking Americans, middle-class Americans most of them, to have their taxes raised next year by a thousand bucks on average, just so millionaires and billionaires don\'t see their taxes raised just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 It just doesn\'t seem fair to this President or to Americans of every political persuasion across the country.\xc2\xa0 So we believe very firmly that the Senate ought to act on a vote and ought to say yes to a payroll tax cut extension later this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tVictoria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a U.N. report out today says Syrian security forces have committed gross violations of human rights since the crackdown, including killing hundreds of children and sexually abusing boys.\xc2\xa0 And even with the sanctions imposed by the Arab League, is it time for the U.N. Security Council to get involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the report that you referenced, but we have very strongly condemned the violence perpetrated by the Assad regime, the gross violations of human rights perpetrated by the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We have worked very hard to isolate that regime and, as you know, we took action, and we have since seen the EU take action, the Turkish government take action, the Arab League take action, to further isolate the Assad regime because of its refusal to cease and desist from the kind of violence that it\xe2\x80\x99s perpetrating, and the kind of violence you just referenced.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the right action.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right action is demonstrated by the support for that approach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen now, not just among Western nations, European nations, but also by the Arab League.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work to isolate the Assad regime because he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly lost his legitimacy to lead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question is that is it time, perhaps, for the next step?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with international organizations.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken is the right approach and that it is most effective when we have this kind of concerted, broad effort, as demonstrated most recently by the Arab League\xe2\x80\x99s action.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Iran followed the President through the Asia trip. Are there any concrete steps that you can report or talk about now regarding China and Russia?\xc2\xa0 Efforts to come about with a unified approach to prevent --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you know from the Board of Governors vote that there is great unity in the international community in condemning Iran\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to live up to its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 That vote coincided, as I think Tom Donilon mentioned when he briefed in Indonesia, with a U.N. vote condemning the attempted assassination of the Saudi ambassador to the United States -- overwhelming votes, including Arab states and other states around the country, with very few opposing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that demonstrates the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken here that has unified the world in isolating and pressuring Iran because of its behavior, whereas in the past we had a situation where Iran did not face the same kind of pressure because there was disunity in the international community about what action to take, and some folks were blaming the United States, when in fact that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xc2\xa0 The action that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken has demonstrated that the bad behavior is being perpetrated by the Iranian regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing to move us past the point where we were --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you saw some new sanctions that we put forward.\xc2\xa0 You saw some other sanctions that others have put forward.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue to put pressure on the Iranian regime.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that that pressure is having an impact has I think been validated by a lot of outside sources and validated in fact by the President of Iran.\xc2\xa0 So that pressure continues.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll ratchet it up in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the newest move by the Arab League against Syria, there are a couple of countries that came out, one of them being Iraq, that said that they won\'t impose these -- or, I guess, enact these sanctions or act on them.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to countries like that that are partners of the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the significant fact here is the action that the Arab League took, which reflects the action that the EU took, the United States took, that Turkey took.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s our focus, is that there is a remarkable amount of agreement, internationally, among not just Western states but states in the region about how reprehensible the actions that the Syrian regime has taken are.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that that kind of isolation will have an effect and that it is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s no discussion with U.S. partners that are --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you perhaps to the State Department for specific conversations that may be taking place, or might take place with other countries that have a different view.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think the story here, and I think it\'s a pretty remarkable story, is the broad consensus that we\'ve seen in isolating Syrian for its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tSam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Senator Toomey said he saw wiggle room in the President\'s veto threat for the sequester, specifically to defense, arguing that the President be comfortable with the size of the cuts but he could take some from defense and apply them elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 Can you address that specifically?\xc2\xa0 And also, has the President talked with Secretary Panetta about his concerns over the defense trigger?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m sure the President and Secretary Panetta, because they speak all the time, have spoken about this. Let me be very clear:\xc2\xa0 The President said there are no easy off-ramps here.\xc2\xa0 Congress voted to impose the sequester on it to hold its own feet to the fire, to get it to act.\xc2\xa0 To then tell -- it\'s the kind of behavior -- to suggest that they should undo what they did just a few months ago, to declare to the world, as they did when the held this vote, the Budget Control Act, that we\'re going to hold ourselves responsible, and then a few months later say, never mind -- that\'s not acceptable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not undoing it, it\'s just -- the same amount of money would be cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Changing it is undoing it.\xc2\xa0 The whole purpose of the design of the sequester was to make it so onerous for everybody that it would never come to pass.\xc2\xa0 To change it so that it\'s not so onerous only relieves pressure on Congress.\xc2\xa0 And obviously Congress needs an immense amount of pressure to get positive things done.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to clarify, a veto threat -- sorry, he would veto a threat to change the amount of defense cuts --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that the sequester should stay in place and that Congress should act.\xc2\xa0 Because Congress passed a law holding itself responsible, and holding itself accountable and they should do the right thing and get it done.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no wiggle room, to use your phrase, as I think I said in a briefing either here or on Air Force One last week.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:25 P.M.
