b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>3:59 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on the Times Square bomb suspect.\xc2\xa0 We have a report out from law enforcement officials saying that he has been connected to a terror training camp in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Are we now looking at someone who is not a lone wolf but someone who might have connections to an overseas plot?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say this -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of an active and ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 We are -- part of that active and ongoing investigation is to examine the time that this individual spent in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more to discuss on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you been able to rule out the idea that he was acting alone?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is an ongoing investigation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything further on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, one of the things that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really been explained very clearly is how he actually managed to get on this flight.\xc2\xa0 He was on the no-fly list earlier that day; his name was very well known in the law enforcement community.\xc2\xa0 So how did that happen?\xc2\xa0 How did he make it through?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a process going back and looking at all that happened.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important to understand that the system is built with necessary and built-in redundancy so that if a name is added and a carrier misses the added name, that Customs and Border Patrol, once a manifest is locked, runs those names through a center and can identify anything that a carrier may have missed.</p>\n<p>I think Secretary Napolitano and others said today -- again, talked about the fact that that was built-in redundancy.\xc2\xa0 CBP caught and apprehended that individual before the plane left, and even would have, I think she said, done so -- we had the authority to either have the plane land or turn around.</p>\n<p>So, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of built-in redundancies, this being one of them, where Customs and Border Patrol checks a locked manifest to ensure that, again, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake by a carrier, it can be double-checked.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is this a case of a mistake by this carrier?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the investigation we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to anyone at BP yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Spoken with anybody --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyone at BP yet?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you feel that BP is now responding appropriately to the oil slick?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Steve, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to add from yesterday in terms of this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are many different things that BP has expertise on and are working on, most notably capping the well.\xc2\xa0 We are focused on responding to the leak and ensuring a minimal amount of environmental or economic disruption.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our focus.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about this federal law that may or may not require -- or BP would be capped at $75 million in payout?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Understand this -- there is -- they are fully liable for cleanup and recovery costs per the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\xc2\xa0 The cap is not in place if somebody is found to be either grossly negligent, conduct willful -- involved in willful misconduct, or in violation of federal regulations.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation ongoing as to the cause behind the spill.</p>\n<p>In addition to that -- I checked on this at the conclusion of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing -- folks in the administration were working on legislation to lift that cap and extend it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a situation where $75 million could easily -- we could easily top $75 million in a short period of time.</p>\n<p>We understand that.\xc2\xa0 This law was passed and signed 20 years ago.\xc2\xa0 So there are failsafes that are built into that law that remove the cap based on the conditions that caused the spill, and our administration will work with Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to change that cap and ensure, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and as the President has said, that BP is the responsible party, they\xe2\x80\x99re the cause of this spill, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for everything involved in this spill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there another cap that you would support in this legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Senator Menendez, his bill is at $10 billion.\xc2\xa0 I have -- they\xe2\x80\x99re working with and thinking through various caps.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would -- suffice to say, our admonition that BP will pay for this leak is -- they will pay for this leak.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding reports from the Pakistani government that Faisal Shahzad had been at a training camp, did U.S. intelligence -- had the Pakistanis -- before this incident took place, had the Pakistani government told the U.S. government in any way about Faisal Shahzad having attended this camp?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can go back and see whether any of that came across.\xc2\xa0 I would say this about the government of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re in close contact with them and working with them on a number of issues surrounding this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The no-fly list -- is there a difference between how airlines treat passengers on the no-fly list who are flying into the U.S. and how airlines treat passengers on the no-fly list who are flying out of the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DHS, Jake, on the specifics of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 9/11 Commission recommended that there be increased security not only on people coming into this country but people leaving this country, and there have been criticisms that that last part has not really been acted on.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with folks here.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- I do think it is important to stress that, as I said a minute ago, the system is built with mechanisms -- duplicative mechanisms in order to ensure that if -- again, if a carrier isn\xe2\x80\x99t picking up a change in the no-fly list, that that change can be caught when Customs and Border Patrol go through the manifest again prior to the flight leaving.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding Abdulmutallab and this incident with Shahzad, it would seem that both times the American people got lucky; both times Abdulmutallab and Shahzad failed to detonate the bomb, but had it not been for the terrorists\xe2\x80\x99 -- the attempted terrorists\xe2\x80\x99 failure, we could be looking at disasters.</p>\n<p>I know the President credited vigilant, innocent bystanders who called it in, but it would seem, at least based on what NYPD says, the reason the incident didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen is because the bomb wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- does he just feel lucky?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it feels like we dodged a bullet here again.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I think as the President said today, this is a reminder of those that seek to do this country and its citizens -- its innocent citizens harm.\xc2\xa0 It is why we must remain vigilant.\xc2\xa0 It is why we are proud of the law enforcement that we have; that, as you heard Commissioner Kelly discuss, was able to go from the scene of this possible incident on Saturday night and have somebody apprehended some 53 hours later; the vigilance of, as you mentioned, citizens that are -- that noticed suspicious activity.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President and this administration will continue to take all the steps that are necessary to keep our country safe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President look at this incident and say, my God, it\xe2\x80\x99s just because this guy was incompetent that the bomb didn\xe2\x80\x99t go off; we need to take step A, B, C, D?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got, Jake, a very active investigation in which we\xe2\x80\x99ll have course to look at all of the circumstances surrounding this and change whatever needs to be changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no feeling of relief by the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- look, Jake, suffice to say each and every day the President receives information that -- of aspects of individuals that seek to do this country harm.\xc2\xa0 Each and every day his job is to do all that he can to ensure, with his administration, that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass.</p>\n<p>Obviously there is a tremendous relief that nobody was hurt, and great thanks for those that, in a short period of time, have done the job they needed to do to track this individual down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I want to follow on that because as Jake points out, the Denver case, the Christmas Day case, now this case, there seems to be an increase.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve known since 9/11 that terrorists --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Remember also there\xe2\x80\x99s the Headley case in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the Denver case, which, for those unfamiliar, that\xe2\x80\x99s Zazi, an individual through -- let me make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m careful here -- through methods is discovered and apprehended.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I think maybe the tell of this is law enforcement that continue to do a superb job in keeping us safe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but this had been happening since 9/11 a lot in the shadows.\xc2\xa0 And now in recent months, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s watch, the American people are seeing these play out a lot more, and coming very close, as Jake said, to actually being terror attacks with lives lost.\xc2\xa0 What do you think is going on here?\xc2\xa0 Do you think the terrorists are increasing of their efforts much more now than they were just a year or so ago?\xc2\xa0 Is there -- do they see an opportunity?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the patterns that they\xe2\x80\x99re involved in.\xc2\xa0 I can speak to the patterns that this administration is involved in and the fact that we have greatly increased our tempo as it relates to terrorist activities throughout the world on a number of continents.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President has been very focused on that since the time he came to office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the no-fly list question, you said it\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated now.\xc2\xa0 But after the Christmas Day terror attempt, there were also all kinds of reviews here by the White House.\xc2\xa0 And in that case --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just make sure that I understand.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an active and ongoing investigation that is working through a whole host of issues.\xc2\xa0 So, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But after the Christmas Day attack, the President ordered reviews here of his administration about the terror watch list, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 And then he came back to the White House after being in Hawaii, January 5th, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong.\xc2\xa0 I want those reforms implemented immediately so that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And yet here we are four months later, someone is put on the no-fly list and is able to get on a plane anyway.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, let\xe2\x80\x99s not -- let\xe2\x80\x99s get the course of the facts here before we jump to any series of lies and what-fors based on the fact that this is an individual that was put on the no-fly list, and as a course of how the no-fly list works, Customs and Border Patrol identified and apprehended that suspect.\xc2\xa0 So that person was on the no-fly list, and that plane didn\xe2\x80\x99t fly, and that individual didn\xe2\x80\x99t fly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in the case of the Christmas Day bomber, he was not on the no-fly list; he was on a separate terror watch list.\xc2\xa0 So the President said he ordered reviews to sort all of this out.\xc2\xa0 So how can the American people have confidence in these various terror watch lists, no-fly lists, if people are still able to get on planes?\xc2\xa0 In both cases they were able, despite being on various lists --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about two different cases and, quite frankly, two different lists.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a TIDES list and you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a no-fly list.\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that your viewers understand the individual was on a no-fly list, and as a result of being on that no-fly list, and the Customs and Border Patrol checking the manifest, once locked for a flight leaving this country the same way they do in checking inbound flights that come from overseas -- that individual was pulled off of a plane.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A plane that had already left the gate.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it had left, and they then pulled it back.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working through some of the tick-tock, but understand this, Jake, that the list identifies people that are not allowed to fly.\xc2\xa0 This individual was identified, as a course of Customs and Border Patrol, and apprehended.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t fly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Initially because an airline employee saw that he paid cash at the last minute and then alerted folks.\xc2\xa0 So he did --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but the plane did leave the gate.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m checking on some of the tick-tock on this.\xc2\xa0 Understanding, again -- let me go through some of the tick-tock on this and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing on the timeline.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President -- the car started smoking, as we understand, at about 6:28 p.m. on Saturday night.\xc2\xa0 The President, when you put out a release on Saturday night, said that he was briefed on this at 10:45 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Is that the first time he was briefed, and are you concerned that there was four hours between when this started -- I know he can\xe2\x80\x99t be on top of every single situation in the world, but this is Times Square, it was shut down.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about the time -- it took four hours before the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, Ed, I was at -- I was sitting on the same stage you were, and reading e-mails from the Situation Room about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not my question.\xc2\xa0 So you were being notified.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There were many of us that were being notified.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I was sitting -- from where I was sitting, the vantage point -- the person that I could see most squarely was the mayor of New York.\xc2\xa0 So throughout the course of this, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m checking and seeing updates about a possible situation, which, in all honesty, Ed, we get a lot of, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s something that might come from a flight or some -- a passenger might say something that -- we went through this on the trip to Prague.</p>\n<p>So obviously many of us were alerted.\xc2\xa0 John briefed the President right after he left -- right after he left the dinner.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you mentioned the Headley case after Zazi, and Times Square and the Christmas bomber were all mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House -- the perception of the White House that there has been an increase in attempted attacks over the past -- during the President\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I just -- Ed was listing high-profile cases, and I just added one to that list.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Chip, in terms of looking at statistics, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the case or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also said in response to that that the President has increased the tempo against terrorists on continents around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think part of this is in response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Look, there are obviously people that seek to do this country harm that are opposed to what the President outlined in Afghanistan, in terms of increasing our military presence in order to ensure that the Taliban and its extremist allies aren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to take power in that country again and provide a safe haven for al Qaeda in a situation that they had prior to 9/11 that allowed them to train and plan the attacks that were executed on that day without disruption.</p>\n<p>So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s increased tempo, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to it exactly.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are some that have cited both of those for -- cited both of those decisions for their misguided and murderous rages.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s working assumption that there are other people out there right now planning these kinds of attacks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Safe to say, Chip, each and every day and each and every night both the President and all of those charged at a federal, state and local level in keeping this country safe are on alert for anything that could happen.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are vigilant in all that we do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are there some attacks, or at least plots, at some form -- at some level that never become known publicly?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I say yes, then they\xe2\x80\x99d become known, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say what they are.\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to say what they are.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would simply leave it at the fact that, look, the President and the team come across a lot of information every day about those that seek to do this country and its citizens harm.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said earlier that the administration is in close contact with Pakistan and working closely with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Is the President personally involved in that?\xc2\xa0 Has he made any calls to anybody --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The only calls that he\xe2\x80\x99s made that I know of this morning, or this afternoon -- well, he called the head of the Customs and Border Patrol to thank him for the great work that they did in this case.\xc2\xa0 And he spoke with the governors of Arkansas and Mississippi about flooding.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Supreme Court, can you rule out this week yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say -- many of you have e-mailed me throughout the morning and the afternoon about -- I even got -- even got an e-mail early afternoon about whether I could rule out all of tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I will just -- I will just simply say that when the President informs us that he\xe2\x80\x99s made that decision, we will notify you as to when that announcement will be.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to every day rule in or rule out when that might be.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I -- you guys will give me a calendar of, like, circle possible days and sort of narrow this thing down.\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I have -- I said almost the same thing yesterday, exact same thing yesterday, that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was then.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that did not cut down on any of my e-mail traffic.\xc2\xa0 So I will not penalize any of you all for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Circling a day would be very helpful.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All of them that end in \xe2\x80\x9cy\xe2\x80\x9d are still applicable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you lay out -- you mentioned there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of redundancies with the no-fly list at the airport.\xc2\xa0 Can you lay out an ideal case how this works?\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, the airlines check the no-fly list against the passengers, and then they --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get -- I can see if -- I would point you to DHS in terms of -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this.\xc2\xa0 Contact DHS about what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to publicly give you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say there are built-in redundancies.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would make a ton of sense to enumerate publicly exactly what the process is in the event that somebody uses that to figure out how to get around anything.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess -- what I hear you saying is that essentially the system worked because the CBP was able to detect this person and yank them off the plane.\xc2\xa0 Did they miss any opportunity to do that, or was that their first opportunity to detect this person, they availed themselves of it, and it was successful?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to DHS.\xc2\xa0 But whatever term you want to use, Savannah, the no-fly list provides a list of individuals not allowed to fly; checking that through a locked-in manifest for that flight.\xc2\xa0 Customs and Border Patrol identified an individual that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to fly, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the system worked if a person on the no-fly list was able to get on the plane?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Savannah, I think the system is set up to provide, as I said, the type of redundancy which any good system would be set up to do.\xc2\xa0 A suspect was identified, surveilled, apprehended, is in custody, is being questioned, is providing, as the Attorney General and others have said, useful and valuable information, and will soon start the process, the legal process of being brought to justice.</p>\n<p>So whatever term you want to use, a suspect was identified, and in a rather short period of time is providing information that is helpful, and is in the process of soon formally entering the justice system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, Secretary Napolitano indicated that even if the plane had taken off, that DHS and the CBP had the authority to turn the plane around.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President, though, is concerned about a set of policies, a set of procedures that would allow that to happen?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in other words, once the plane has taken off, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as though it\xe2\x80\x99s easy come, easy go -- I mean, then a person on the no-fly list potentially could cause some havoc.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there any policy change that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this -- well, first and foremost, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re alluding to, but I would say that obviously each passenger and their luggage is screened as they would be for any flight.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what, if you were alluding to something, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just wondering -- yes --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that both sets of that screening happens as a matter of every flight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t subject to extra scrutiny, was he?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 But he went through the process of being screened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to -- do you think the President is comfortable with the way these procedures are set up?\xc2\xa0 Nothing about this set of facts jumps out at him as saying, maybe we can do a little better?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Savannah, I think we are -- we will obviously, as we would and as we do in every situation, evaluate everything.\xc2\xa0 But, again, there was a system that provided a name on a list intended not to have an individual fly.\xc2\xa0 Customs and Border Patrol, using that system, found that individual and he was apprehended and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to fly.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who, if anyone, at the White House was consulted on the procedures you used to interrogate the suspect?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say questioning and interrogation, on those aspects -- obviously, John Brennan here.\xc2\xa0 The intelligence community, including the CIA, the Director of National Intelligence, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Department of Homeland Security have all been part of those decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the high-value detainee interrogation group -- was that deployed for this?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The questioning draws on the expertise and the resources of the HIG.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, wait, it draws on the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Expertise and the resources.\xc2\xa0 I am not going to get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually deployed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the identities of who\xe2\x80\x99s exactly in the room, but, again, it draws on the resources of the HIG, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a much comparatively lighter note, could you talk about why the White House will or will not get involved at the Hawaii special election, which looks like a division between two Democrats that\xe2\x80\x99s going to hand a Democratic state to a Republican?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me get some answers for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I have to admit I have -- I love Hawaii, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on flights and oil today.\xc2\xa0 But we will get you something on that, I promise.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in lieu of circling a day on a calendar, can you say whether the President has completed the process of interviewing candidates for the nomination?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to Justice Stevens about his replacement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in his speech today at the Business Council --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just laughing -- not at you, Mark, but April, who started this process many weeks ago, appears to have in her head formulated a different way to ask what she asked several weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 So I want you to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I look forward to it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back there, April, and you can try one more time.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow behind Mark, sure.\xc2\xa0 Let me make sure Mark is done, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My last question.\xc2\xa0 In his speech to the Business Council, the President again today urged them to rein in their lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President think corporations have as much right as anybody to express their view and try and get their wishes done in Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President was speaking specifically about is, as those lobbying activities relate to financial reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that financial reform is in the best interest of those on Wall Street, those on Main Street, and all those that do business with both.\xc2\xa0 We have to have a system in place where the rules of the road do not allow what happened almost two years ago from happening.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any business believes that the economic downturn that was accelerated greatly by, and in many ways caused by, some of the risky decisions that were made on Wall Street -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of those businesses think it\xe2\x80\x99s been a great time for them.</p>\n<p>The President believes that one of the ways to put our economy back on that strong foundation is to have strong rules for the road with financial reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the company believes that the Wall Street reform that he wants is not in the company\xe2\x80\x99s best interests, don\xe2\x80\x99t they have the right to lobby against it, as on any bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They have the right to be wrong that it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of this country -- or that company to have strong rules.\xc2\xa0 The President vehemently disagrees with that.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of a business that can look back at the time, dating back to 2007, and think this was a -- think this was a robust time for them to be selling what they\xe2\x80\x99re selling or to offering what they\xe2\x80\x99re offering, based on the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to sell those products when 8.5 million people have lost their job.</p>\n<p>The President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of all those involved, including business, to support strong financial reform.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, let me go to April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, following up on the Supreme Court, just in one of your answers, it seems like he\xe2\x80\x99s close to -- if he has not, he\xe2\x80\x99s close to finishing up his interview process of the potentials.\xc2\xa0 Is that today, tomorrow, sometime this week?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, seriously, I mean, the way you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That would sort of narrow down the decision-making process if I could close down the decision --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, but no, no, no, the questioning or interviews are somewhat different than the process -- the ending of the process.\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I said this.\xc2\xa0 I think I said -- I hope I said that this is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s not yet finished.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when the President went into it, he had a mindset of what he was looking for in a candidate.\xc2\xa0 Has he -- in the midst of talking to all of these potentials, has he somewhat come away with what he wants and maybe even got more than what he expected in his conversations with you guys?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I, April, for a lot of reasons, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into what he has imparted to us about those conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re midway or close to the end of the list -- I mean, not the list, but the process, possibly -- could you tell us about the list of potentials?\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us -- I mean, not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Names would be good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would love --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I realize, April, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Phone numbers.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed this down for me.\xc2\xa0 Poor Mark was way too subtle.\xc2\xa0 He just -- you know, what about tomorrow or maybe later this week.\xc2\xa0 All you want is the date in which the process of his decision-making will be concluded and the names with which he\xe2\x80\x99ll go through that decision-making process.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She wants an exclusive.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the opportunity to be more fulsome on each of those questions, but I will demure.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I follow up --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to the New York car bomb case, first a factual question.\xc2\xa0 At the time of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, did he have any dangerous weapons or tools in his possession?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t offhand know the specific answer to that, Ed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Napolitano earlier said that -- characterized this as a one-off event.\xc2\xa0 Is that statement inoperative?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think rather than getting into characterizing a lot of these things in the midst of an active investigation, I think we will just simply continue that process of the investigation and have more to say as it transpires.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, can you give us any information about the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s path to U.S. citizenship and what he was doing in the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I want to discuss, no.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Elie Wiesel says the moment of tension between the U.S. and Israel is now gone after the President\xe2\x80\x99s lunch with him today.\xc2\xa0 Did they reach a meeting of the minds on settlement expansion in East Jerusalem?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard -- I think you heard Mr. Wiesel talk about his lunch with the President.\xc2\xa0 They had an opportunity to both talk about and agree on the need to move forward with that peace process.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go further than he would in characterizing what they discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Florida Senator Nelson, who is one of the people sponsoring the legislation that would raise the economic damages to $10 billion, also says that the President\xe2\x80\x99s hopes for expanding offshore oil drilling are dead on arrival.\xc2\xa0 Is the briefing today -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going on now --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I believe there is with Secretary Salazar --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a host of other officials.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that intended to maybe facilitate the passage of this legislation, to deal with some of the concerns that the spill has on people who might have been prepared to support the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, this is a bipartisan, bicameral briefing on the federal response thus far, as you mentioned, on the BP oil spill, the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to date.\xc2\xa0 Wendell, the President has asked for Secretary Salazar, as head of the Department of Interior and has purview over drilling issues, to investigate what happened with this incident and to report back to him in 30 days.\xc2\xa0 And what we have said is that the President would use all of that information to make decisions going forward on our offshore policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for critics who are calling this your Katrina, is there -- President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Katrina --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I say this -- I watched FOX yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to go there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But you sort of -- you opened both the double doors and voila, here I am.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just FOX calling this your Katrina.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but FOX had the very special and unique interview with Michael Brown -- you opened it and I had to do it -- who for those who weren\xe2\x80\x99t let in on the big secret, Mr. Brown, FEMA Director Brown under Katrina, intimated on FOX, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I will editorially say, didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be pushed back on real hard -- that this spill was leaked on purpose in order for us to walk back our environmental and drilling decisions, and that the leak that we did on purpose got out of control and now is too big to contain.</p>\n<p>So suffice to say, Wendell --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is his attribution?\xc2\xa0 What is his -- Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s attribution?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can only wish that the network that you work for had asked that prior to interviewing him yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But reporters in here asked that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you should --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You should call headquarters, my friend, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- ask for somebody who makes the decisions to put people like that -- because I got to tell you, Wendell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure that a factual answer that I might give to any one of your questions is going to change the notion that your network put out the former FEMA director to make an accusation that the well had been purposely set off in order to change an offshore drilling decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nor would that affect the reporting I do.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t intimate that it did.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would -- you and Major should --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we can, let\xe2\x80\x99s move on from it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You could get on a conference call and maybe do some work.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there lessons learned here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 From?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This oil spill -- from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we, first and foremost, are focused on the efforts that I discussed on capping this well and ensuring what escapes from that well doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do damage to the environment or to the local economy, and ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got mechanisms in place to deal with the possible spread.\xc2\xa0 We will have a chance to go back and look at the conditions that led to -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Secretary Salazar is tasked to do, to look at that and to make evaluations as to anything that could have been done differently.</p>\n<p>I will say the Coast Guard responded immediately to distress calls of a fire and explosion aboard the BP Deepwater Horizon with four vessels as part of those recovery efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in that list that you gave us earlier of recent terrorist acts, Major Nidal Hasan, is he on there, too, the Fort Hood shooter?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would add him on there, too, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in developing these connections to Pakistan, are you also looking at the apparent reversal, economic reversal that this guy has suffered recently as a possible motivation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would say at this point in the investigation I think any and all leads are being actively looked at in determining where this individual went and what this individual was intending to do, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hello, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How are you?\xc2\xa0 Welcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m good.\xc2\xa0 You aren\xe2\x80\x99t always going to do these this late, are you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I apologize.\xc2\xa0 I originally was scheduled to do this right -- this would have overlapped with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that that made a whole lot of sense for you guys.\xc2\xa0 So we will try to do these at a more sane hour.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Accepting your argument about this process of redundancy, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask this question in our own process of redundancy --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you -- so accepting that, I can see how a passenger could get on a plane past airline personnel, even though they\xe2\x80\x99re on a no-fly list.\xc2\xa0 But once they\xe2\x80\x99re on that plane, before it leaves the gate, does this mean that there is no -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a no-fly list, so the plane -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not in the background these redundancies checking planes so that they don\xe2\x80\x99t even take off before the backup regulators can attest that everyone on that plane is not on a no-fly list?\xc2\xa0 And is it even, as a practical matter, possible for planes to be held at gates until all the people who can weigh in on this do weigh in?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- again, let me try to get better clarity from DHS, because I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking -- well, let me just take a look at whether the -- I think I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, in terms of when the redundancy happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it happen before the person flies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get with DHS and others on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, possibly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that conflict -- I mean, federal regulations limit or hold airlines accountable for their taking off on time, and they\xe2\x80\x99re penalized if they too often don\xe2\x80\x99t take off on time.\xc2\xa0 Is there a conflict there between federal regulations on takeoff and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard talked about today, but I can certainly check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, admittedly you have all these redundancies and backups and the rest of it.\xc2\xa0 My question is to the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of all this.\xc2\xa0 Is he not troubled that the first layer was a pass through, that the suspect got on the plane despite being on the list?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of -- at this early hour.\xc2\xa0 We will go back and see the time in which the information was added.\xc2\xa0 There obviously is a carrier element to all of this in -- and we will investigate whether that carrier element was acted upon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the fact that the man was on the plane.\xc2\xa0 So is that not troubling that he got through that first layer?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that the reason that that redundancy is built in is because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave any and all of this completely up to a carrier.\xc2\xa0 You want --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that.\xc2\xa0 I just want to understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- but I just want to -- I just want to make the point that that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason the system is designed in a way that ensures that the action of one isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t determine the entire outcome.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that even at that point there is a step beyond -- quite frankly, this is somebody who -- this is a locked manifest, this is, \xe2\x80\x9cHere are the people that are on our plane as part of that flight plan and can be double-checked through Customs and Border Patrol,\xe2\x80\x9d sending that list to a center to be checked against the no-fly list.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And say, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the list of people on our plane.\xc2\xa0 See you later, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking off.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I mean, then the plane left the gate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying about all the other layers and all that, but there is still the fact that the man was on the plane, the plane pushed back.\xc2\xa0 And the President does not find --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President does not find that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I would say this, Mark.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to look at every aspect of what happened, again, understanding that the way this system is designed is to ensure that many actions can check the actions of others.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the no-fly list identified this individual.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bridging back to the Supreme Court, do any of the events of the last three days make the President reluctant to choose someone like Janet Napolitano if she\xe2\x80\x99s in a role that he thinks he needs her in?\xc2\xa0 Have her chances of being chosen been decreased?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think he is enormously grateful for the work that she has done and the amount that just over the -- as you said, over the past few days -- please don\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m lauding her for the current job to -- obviously the President has a number of choices in front of him.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d use this opportunity just to say that I think the President believes that she is and that many people that work throughout law enforcement and at DHS are doing a terrific job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s the pick or she\xe2\x80\x99s not?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I could just -- I can only -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just thinking in my head like what exactly are the headlines saying right now as I say nice things about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just rule it out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything else you want to say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9bNapolitano might be picked,\xe2\x80\x99 says Gibbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 I can only -- this will be fun to watch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On something completely different --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Spin the wheel, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow at the Cinco de Mayo event that you\xe2\x80\x99re having, is the President going to talk about immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will admit, I have not looked at the remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask is because he -- the last time he talked about it on Thursday he caused I guess you could say some confusion about where he stood and there\xe2\x80\x99s been a kind of strong reaction from the Hispanic community about that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I will check --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there anything else he\xe2\x80\x99s doing now that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to New Jersey?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not gotten any scheduling updates, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the only thing that you know of is the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As best I know, we have not added an additional event.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaritas?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaritas?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of immigration, the President has obviously been pretty critical of the law in Arizona, calling it misguided, suggesting it may even violate federal civil rights laws.\xc2\xa0 What are his thoughts on the calls to boycott Arizona?\xc2\xa0 Would he agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him render an opinion on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Senator McCain said this morning that it would be a mistake to read Shahzad his rights for questioning.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a -- how do you analyze that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Carefully.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that these are decisions that are made in consultation with the intelligence community and with highly trained counterterrorism officials who have -- are no less vested in getting every last bit of information from an interview or an interrogation than is possible.\xc2\xa0 I think the insinuation somehow that that is not the case I think is somewhat of an affront to law enforcement, on a day in which I hope we laud what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done.</p>\n<p>Some of the comments have been curious, I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit.\xc2\xa0 To mention that -- one of the comments was, \xe2\x80\x9cI know he\xe2\x80\x99s an American citizen, but still\xe2\x80\x9d -- a unique viewpoint.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that a factor at all in the decision about when to Mirandize him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the Attorney General said, there was a -- originally interviewed under a national security exemption and, as I understand it, the guidance was after checking with those in the intelligence community that that task was given to, again, those highly trained counterterorrism officials.\xc2\xa0 He has -- he waived that, and at least when I was coming out, I was under the impression he was continuing to be questioned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think he said public safety exemption.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, public safety.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I also just quickly ask you, do you know if the administration is considering taking any steps to stop test drilling in the Arctic?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To block test drilling that\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled to begin in the Arctic.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you have dates for -- let me -- test drilling in Alaska?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arctic.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let me check.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the national security exemption and the public safety exemption basically the same thing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I meant to say public safety.\xc2\xa0 I was, in my head, thinking the same thing, so I have not created a new exemption yet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the costs of the oil spill, in terms of what BP is liable for, is it just damages, or are you keeping tabs on the costs of sending the Coast Guard, and all the federal costs, the C-130s that had to be flown?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is -- well, that has been discussed.\xc2\xa0 That is part of the cleanup and recovery efforts that BP would be liable for, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if the President thought that drilling was safe when he made his -- relatively safe, in that there were few accidents like these -- when he made his announcement five or so weeks ago, why would he not just change his mind at this point, kind of akin to the governor of California and say, \xe2\x80\x9cI was mistaken, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not safe, I want to walk back from my announced policy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think there are a series of things you want to examine and investigate as part of what may or may not have happened.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- I mean, is there a -- is there a technological -- was there a technological failure?\xc2\xa0 Are there additional steps or -- I hate to use the word since we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it a lot today -- redundancies in a blowout preventer as part of a valve that is or isn\xe2\x80\x99t part of what\xe2\x80\x99s -- may or may not be required by law now?</p>\n<p>Again, understanding, Richard, that even in the area of the Gulf that we were -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing, there are lots of active wells.\xc2\xa0 So the President -- I will say this, and I heard him say this yesterday -- the President believes that domestic production has to be part of our overall comprehensive energy strategy; that not -- we cannot -- even as we have invested a lot of money and helped others invest even more in wind and solar power, that alone isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to change it.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s decision on loan guarantees for a nuclear plant, that alone won\xe2\x80\x99t change it.\xc2\xa0 There are a host of things that we have to do to solve our growing dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 And the President will -- is eager to know the findings of this investigation, and we will use those findings to make any of these decisions moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on the $75 million, raising that cap, could that be retroactive to apply to this situation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, the legislation introduced by Senator Menendez and others does go back and do that retroactively.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we would be supportive of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a couple more questions on the spill.\xc2\xa0 You talk about with great confidence that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to recoup this money from BP, yet the laws that currently exist requires the determination of gross negligence.\xc2\xa0 Should we assume that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The law -- well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 Under that law, those are the three cap-lifting exemptions that the legislation that I just talked about would seek to change, and we have been working on efforts to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it constitutional to retroactively alter a law so that it applies to a retroactive circumstance?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been done in -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about retroactivity as it relates to other compensation, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, it appears from a briefing with Congress today that this particular platform had been inspected shortly before the accident, perhaps as soon as two weeks.\xc2\xa0 Can you sort of explain what you know about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything beyond what Assistant [sic] Secretary of the Interior David Hayes in the briefing that we would have done last Thursday made mention -- I forget the exact time period that he made mention of when that rig had been inspected.\xc2\xa0 I can go back and see.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen or heard on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick question on terror -- on the Times Square plot.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been fairly lucky, as you mentioned before, in terms of the ineptitude of these folks.\xc2\xa0 Do you think the American people ought to brace themselves for the inevitability in the not-too-distant future that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a successful terrorist attack on American soil?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- Glen, I would rather just simply leave it at the fact that, as I said earlier, this administration, this President are doing all that they can within their power to prevent anything from happening.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the security -- any of the security changes put into place in the wake of Flight 253 help in the detection and apprehension of the Times Square suspect?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked John that question, and I have not been able to get something from him on that yet.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a real quick question on the Middle East peace process on a day in which Elie Wiesel met with the President.\xc2\xa0 It was reported on Friday that President Obama had spoken to European leaders and told them that if talks between Israel and the Palestinians remain stalemated in September or October, he\xe2\x80\x99ll convene an international summit on achieving Mideast peace.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm if -- whether the President is going down that road?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that, but I will check with them and see if they have anything on it.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Listening to you, I get the impression that unlike Governor Schwarzenegger, unlike certain officials in Virginia, the President is committed -- we need an energy mix for our energy security.\xc2\xa0 Now, does that stance change if they can\xe2\x80\x99t cap off that leak and the damage gets much greater?\xc2\xa0 Does he change his mind at some point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On the plan that he announced in March?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the need -- yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I would not rule it out.\xc2\xa0 Again, the reason the President asked for Secretary Salazar to do this particular investigation was to examine what happened, and whether or not there was anything that could or should have been done that would likely have prevented something like that from happening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And absolutely he told us very specifically that though the 30-day period does not augment any leasing or drilling activities that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, the President wants to use that investigation to inform anything that might happen going forward.</p>\n<p>So obviously he will take that into accord.\xc2\xa0 There are -- there are, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, there are many, many wells that have been drilled and explored in that section and area of the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there was -- this is a little bit more unique because it is in 5,000 feet of water, not in several hundred or a hundred feet of water.\xc2\xa0 And obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President will want to look at.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n4:55 P.M.
