EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One for our flight to North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 The President today, as you know, is visiting Mount Holly because he laid out a blueprint for a new era of American energy in his State of the Union address, an economy fueled by homegrown and alternative energy sources that will be designed in America and produced by American workers.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday the President will visit Daimler Trucks North America Mount Holly Truck Manufacturing plant in Mount Holly, North Carolina, to deliver remarks on American energy.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about the need to take a sustained, all-of-the-above approach on energy, responsibly expanding domestic production of natural gas and oil, improving the efficiency of our cars and trucks, and making the long-term investments in alternatives to oil to provide American families the choices we all deserve.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a strategy that is a win for the economy, a win for energy security and a win for national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Mount Holly, the President will announce a new $1 billion National Community Deployment Challenge to spur deployment of clean, advanced vehicles in communities around the country.\xc2\xa0 The President will also announce a set of incentives to help consumers and businesses purchase new advanced trucks and cars, including increasing and expanding the current tax credit for advanced vehicles from the $7,500 credit that currently exists up to $10,000, allowing the credit to be applied to the different types of technologies not currently covered.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, the President is announcing a new research challenge that invests in breakthrough technologies to make electric vehicles as affordable and convenient to own and operate as gasoline-powered vehicles are by the end of the decade.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President think that Mitt Romney is inevitable as his opponent in November this morning?\xc2\xa0 What is his message to Mitt Romney?\xc2\xa0 Does your message change at all today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\'t have a -- and the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a message for any particular candidate running for this office, and we don\'t presume to know who the nominee in the Republican Party will be.\xc2\xa0 That\'s up to the voters in the various states across the country who will be participating in Republican primaries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I\'ve pointed out in the past, the President is grateful for the support within his own party, the breadth and depth of which allows him in this primary season not to have an opponent, which means he can focus his energies on his job as President -- working to take the right actions to help our economy grow, to have an -- increase job creation, and to ensure the national security of Americans as well as of our allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, with the President going in today to North Carolina and Friday to Texas, why no stops to visit, tour the\xc2\xa0 tornado victims?\xc2\xa0 I know North Carolina was hit by some of the tornadoes -- not as devastating maybe as some other states -- but he\'ll also be flying over some other states that got hit fairly hard.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President has spoken with the governors of all the states that have been affected by the terrible storms of the last week or so, and he has instructed his FEMA Director to ensure that FEMA is positioned and prepared to provide whatever assistance is necessary and requested by the states that have been affected by these terrible storms.\xc2\xa0 The President has expressed his condolences to the families of the victims of these storms and will certainly instruct his administration to work with the states as they rebuild after the damage that was caused.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Iran\'s return to the negotiating table -- of the P5-plus-1, what kind of demands are going to be made of Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will demand that Iran live up to its international obligations; that it provide verifiable assurances it is not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important to reemphasize what the President made clear yesterday, that part of our dual-track approach here is to engage in talks with the Iranians, with the P5-plus-1, but to do it fully aware of the approach that, unfortunately, the Iranians have taken in the past.\xc2\xa0 We are very clear-eyed about the way that Iran has approached negotiations in the past, and we will not relent in our efforts through sanctions and other measures to isolate and pressure Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tActions are what matters -- actions are what matter here, and we will judge Iran by its actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GM had to suspend their Volt production because of low sales.\xc2\xa0 Is the President sort of bucking consumer demand with these new incentives for alternative-fuel vehicles?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have a great deal of data here that I can provide to you about the enormous benefits of, and significant demand for, the kind of fuel-efficient trucks and cars that the President\'s visit today will highlight.\xc2\xa0 With regards to heavy trucks and the -- I think there\'s something like -- they account for 5 percent of the traffic on our roads and 20 percent of our oil consumption or gas consumption nationally.\xc2\xa0 Those are rough stats.\xc2\xa0 I can get you the specifics.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it is simply a fact that these technologies are going to be developed somewhere, and where they are developed there will be good jobs associated with the development of those technologies.\xc2\xa0 The countries that best develop these technologies and utilize them will enhance their energy independence.\xc2\xa0 And the President is absolutely committed, as part of his sustained, all-of-the-above approach to energy, to ensuring that we do not, in the United States of America, simply throw up our hands and cede the industries of the future to other countries, our competitors around the globe, including China, India, Spain, other European countries, Brazil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that for our economy to flourish in the 21st century, we need to be leaders in the alternative energy field, and that\'s part of what this visit will highlight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The $10,000 is for passenger cars as well as heavy trucks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll get paper to you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the current tax credit for advanced vehicles, so that would be, I believe, both cars and trucks.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure we get the specifics for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to Iran, the President spoke about the drumbeat of war.\xc2\xa0 What impact will the resumption of talks have on that?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect this sort of to discourage speculation that any sort of military action against Iran is imminent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see how those who beat the drums of war proceed in reaction to the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and in reaction to developments.\xc2\xa0 I want to reiterate that simply by responding to the letter from Lady Ashton and engaging in the P5-plus-1 talks, Iran has not by any means satisfied its obligations.\xc2\xa0 And it is only by satisfying its international obligations and assuring in a verifiable way that it is not pursuing nuclear weapons that they can rejoin the international community and get some relief from the sanctions -- the economic sanctions and the isolation that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been enduring as a result of U.S. leadership on this effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President, I think -- the point the President was making was I think vividly clear, which is that there is a great deal of discussion about approaches to Iran as part of the political debate in the United States, but if you look at what is actually being proposed, the President is doing all of those things and leading the effort for three years.\xc2\xa0 And all that remains, the implication is, is the launching of a war.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said yesterday, if the folks out there who are beating the drums of war are seriously calling for that kind of engagement, they ought to make it clear to the American people and they ought to explain why, why now, and what the consequences of that action would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Prime Minister Netanyahu also not maybe getting as far as some of the Republican candidates but certainly expressing severe concern about Iran --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was referring to the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know he was referring to the Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what your point is.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear in his discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu, in his speech to AIPAC, in his press conference yesterday, that he is -- he absolutely shares the concern that the Israeli government, the Prime Minister, have about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions.\xc2\xa0 We coordinate at a greater level than any other previous administration with Israel -- Israeli military and Israeli intelligence -- and we do not -- we see eye-to-eye on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iran and what the threat is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, as the President has made clear on a number of occasions, the surest way to be confident that Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon is through a diplomatic solution to this problem.\xc2\xa0 It is through Iran -- because of the pressure of the international community, the pressure of economic sanctions, the isolation that it is enduring -- makes a decision to give up those ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After these meetings do you still think the Israelis have not made a decision on whether to launch a military strike?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Israelis themselves said so.\xc2\xa0 So, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President stay up for Ohio results?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he did, since -- no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he did.\xc2\xa0 Based on our conversation on Marine One he was not up.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he had events last night, so he wasn\'t paying very close attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Syria.\xc2\xa0 Dempsey was before the Senate this morning.\xc2\xa0 He said that -- he says a no-fly zone is possible over Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is there military planning toward that end?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 My sense, based on what you just described and my understanding of what he said, is that was a statement of logistical possibilities, not a statement of the policy we\'re currently pursuing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a reaction to the Department of Education report yesterday that black and Hispanic kids are three times more likely to get expelled from school and overall face a disproportionate amount of punishment in schools than white --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m afraid I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that report, and I haven\'t heard anyone discuss it in the White House.\xc2\xa0 My guess is the Department of Education would be a good place to start for a reaction to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction on the ADP numbers this morning, 216,000?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we look at, Roger, as you know, is not any individual number in the data that comes out regularly about our economy.\xc2\xa0 What we look at are trends.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly represents another indication that we\'re moving in the right direction, that the economy is creating jobs, that it\'s continuing to grow.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t put much stock in any individual figure.\xc2\xa0 We look at the overall progress we\'re making.\xc2\xa0 And so when we have a really good number we don\xe2\x80\x99t over-interpret it, and when a number is disappointing we don\xe2\x80\x99t overreact to it.\xc2\xa0 We look at what we can do to help the economy grow, the actions we can take around the things that we can control, working either administratively or with Congress, to make sure this recovery continues, and to insulate ourselves from some of the factors that we can\'t control in the global economy.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we\'ll continue to take.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the billion-dollar community program, is that administrative or is that something that needs congressional action?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to get back to you.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s administrative.\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me get back to you.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I should have come more prepared on this subject.\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you\'re interested, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\'t gotten the fact sheet yet either.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do any of the other -- need congressional approval?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he just asked.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on the specifics.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for not having more, but we\'ll get you more information on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President interested in this new iPad that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out today?\xc2\xa0 Does he want one?\xc2\xa0 Is he paying attention to the announcement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had a discussion with him about the announcement today, the iPad announcement today.\xc2\xa0 He is, as I think is now well known, an avid user of his iPad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he get an advanced copy?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, like he did the last one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so.\xc2\xa0 But he thinks, as I think a lot of users do, that the iPad is a great product, and I\'m sure would -- like a lot of us, he looks forward to seeing what the new one has to offer, assuming there is a new one.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any inside information.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:08 A.M.
