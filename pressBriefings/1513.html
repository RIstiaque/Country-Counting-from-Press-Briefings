EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I have specific instructions from the President for the press corps.\xc2\xa0 He wants you to relax and have a good time.\xc2\xa0 Take some walks on the beaches.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is looking to make any news, so he\'s hoping that you guys can enjoy Martha\'s Vineyard while we\'re there.\xc2\xa0 And the second thing I\'ll say is, of course the First Family would very much appreciate if you respect the privacy of the girls while they\'re out here on vacation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0So, with that, if you\'ve got any questions, I\'d be happy to take them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q What kind of briefings is the President receiving while he\'s on vacation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\'s a member of the national security staff who\'s here who will see him every day.\xc2\xa0 The time is varying.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll also receive briefings by paper, and if necessary set up secure teleconferences with advisers in Washington or wherever they might be.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll also be in contact with advisers as appropriate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q No one from NEC?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Can you say anything more about Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 This morning General, I think, Mullen --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Eikenberry I think were pretty fulsome in their comments on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have much to add besides what they had to say.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'re encouraged that Afghanistan had an election and that so many people participated.\xc2\xa0 We obviously won\'t have the results for a while.\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to hearing the results just like everybody else.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Any thing more about the timing of the -- General McChrystal\'s assessment report?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As Admiral Mullen said this morning, looks like we\'ll have the assessment in a couple of weeks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q A couple of weeks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q So this admonition from the President, was that given on the plane now, or what?</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  \xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I asked him if he had the message for the press corps, and that\'s what it is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q On Friday Gibbs said the Nesbitts weren\'t coming.\xc2\xa0 Any change in that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Say that again?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Gibbs said Nesbitts weren\'t expected to join the President on this trip, on Friday.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the case?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.\xc2\xa0 No change to that.\xc2\xa0 Maya and her family are going to be there.\xc2\xa0 They\'re on board right now.\xc2\xa0 Bo is on board.\xc2\xa0 We\'re looking to have a good time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q You said Maya is on board, or they\'re not on board?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Maya is, yes.\xc2\xa0 Maya and her husband and their girls.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Is Mrs. Robinson on board?\xc2\xa0 Is she going to be there?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check it out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q There are no plans to see Senator Kennedy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No plans.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Will he give him a call?\xc2\xa0 Any contact at all?\xc2\xa0 He\'s up in his neck of the woods.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and his family have been in contact with Senator Kennedy and their family over the course of his time as President.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t imagine that contact would continue even while they\'re here.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s no plans at this point to go over to Hyannis Port.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q The advice for us to relax -- how does he plan to relax on this vacation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There isn\'t a lot scheduled for this week.\xc2\xa0 You can bet there\'s going to be some golf playing, maybe a little swimming, but a lot of time spent with his family.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Any time spent with Tiger Woods?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a bad rumor.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t even know that he\'s going to be here this week.\xc2\xa0 But no, there\'s -- nothing like that is on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no plan for that.\xc2\xa0 But certainly Tiger Woods is a good golfer, and it\'s fun to play with him, I hear.\xc2\xa0 Unless you\'re in a tournament and he\'s beating you -- probably by a lot.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Not always.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That was Jeff Zeleny of The New York Times who said that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Another question about foreign affairs.\xc2\xa0 The Middle East -- there was -- I don\'t know, several -- I just received an e-mail from one of my editors with a list of three or four opinion pieces in various newspapers today about the Middle East, talking about how they expect the President to go to the UNGA with some kind of plan.\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything about that?\xc2\xa0 Anything you want to say about that?</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  \xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think there were rumors on that last week when Mubarak was in Washington, and I think that those rumors are a bit premature.\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to what Gibbs said that day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q What are you going to do to relax?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 My wife Laura is going to be there, and we\'re going to spend some time checking out the restaurants across the vineyard.\xc2\xa0 But other than that, I\'ll probably be just, you know, knee deep in briefing materials just trying to learn as much as I can.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll spend a little time with you guys every morning.\xc2\xa0 Me and Tommy will both be there.\xc2\xa0 He\'s coming off of vacation, so I\'m going to direct most calls to him because he needs to actually do a little bit of work.\xc2\xa0 His e-mail address is <a href="mailto:tvietor@who.eop.gov">tvietor@who.eop.gov</a>.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q What is your briefing plan?\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow and then?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I will brief tomorrow morning -- time yet to be determined.\xc2\xa0 And then me and Tommy plan to be around the briefing center -- the filing center in the mornings if people have questions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ll be on cell phone and BlackBerry.\xc2\xa0 And if people need us, they can certainly find us.\xc2\xa0 And then we\'ll play it by ear as the week goes on.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q When other Presidents have come here in recent years or recent decades, they\'ve done a lot of public things, in terms of like with the residents of the island.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve had dinners and parties and things.\xc2\xa0 How does President Obama intend to communicate his intention to remain private?\xc2\xa0 Like, will he see any of those people at all?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has a lot of contributors who live there, et cetera.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just start by saying that the President is coming to Martha\'s Vineyard because it\'s a beautiful place where the residents are great and the people who come to visit in the summers ain\'t too bad, either.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve got great beaches, great restaurants, a good community.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to enjoying it like he has over the course of the last 10 years when he\'s been here before.\xc2\xa0 He\'s on vacation, though, and there are no scheduled plans.\xc2\xa0 And just like when anybody else goes on vacation, if dinner plans pop up, they go out to dinner.\xc2\xa0 If your friends come over, they come over.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\'ll all just be playing this by ear.</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  \xc2\xa0Q You\'ve mentioned restaurants a couple times.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that they\'ll go out for a bite in a local restaurant, the First Family?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s no -- nothing scheduled on that front.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0Q Very relaxing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You bet.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we were going for.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  END <br/>  2:16 P.M. EDT</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
