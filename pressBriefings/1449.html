EST</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I hope everybody is doing well. I have no beginning announcements, so I will turn it over to Ms. Loven.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two Afghanistan questions.\xc2\xa0 You guys talked a lot ahead of the speech last night about the sort of conditions and the kinds of sort of carrot/sticks that we placed on Karzai, and the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t really get into a lot of specifics in his speech.\xc2\xa0 Can you be more specific about what is being communicated to him and his government about what he needs to do and what will happen if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get into the private conversation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the two Presidents -- let me finish --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have soldiers dying over there for his government.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish my answer so we -- I don\'t think I finished the first clause before -- they obviously had, and I think we read this out that they spoke for about an hour in the Situation Room before the President talked to the country -- talked to the nation about his policy -- in a continuing series of conversations, Jennifer, that the President has had with President Karzai about the notion that it is time for a new chapter in Afghan governance.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President detailed last night steps that had to be taken under the umbrella of the days of blank checks were over, and that if President Karzai is unable or unwilling to make changes in corruption or governance, that we will identify people at a subcabinet level, at a district level that can implement the types of services and basic governance without corruption that Afghans need.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would say obviously President Karzai, in his inaugural speech, said some encouraging things.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously picks coming up for his cabinet which I think we will be watching in many ways.\xc2\xa0 And I think part of -- very much what the President has done is provide a strong incentive for the Karzai government to get its act together.\xc2\xa0 There is a transition point for the Afghans which was gotten -- as part of this review, established the transition point of July 2011, which ensures that the Afghans have to make progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We fully believe that we have to have that willing partner and believe that this policy puts in place the necessary incentives to make sure that that happens.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How confident is the White House that Karzai gets the message, that you actually have really that much leverage over him in what he does?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, two things.\xc2\xa0 I think based on what he said in his inaugural and based on the conversations back and forth that the two Presidents have had, the President remains -- is confident that President Karzai understands what\'s expected.\xc2\xa0 I would say, again, the reason why there\'s -- a transition point provides an incentive to ensure that steps will and must be taken.\xc2\xa0 The President is very serious about that, I think, again, outlining that the time for blank checks was over.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more quickly.\xc2\xa0 Did Karzai ever ask for such a timeline or withdrawal point to not be set?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, but I\'d have to go back and look through notes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of things also on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 One is, today Secretary Gates said the U.S. might not begin to scale back the troop surge until after July 2011.\xc2\xa0 Is that some kind of discrepancy?\xc2\xa0 And also, what does the President see happening within the next 18 months in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what would be different between now and then?\xc2\xa0 And then if things don\'t work out, is he open to, you know, a major kind of course correction?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- three things.\xc2\xa0 The third thing I think is related very much to the second, which is what the President envisions is -- and, quite frankly, what he laid out in some detail last night over the course of more than 30 minutes -- we are going to increase the number of our forces in Afghanistan, getting more there sooner and staying for a longer period of time, in order to degrade the Taliban, fight that insurgency; at the same time, help train Afghan national security forces -- an army and a police -- and accelerating that to the point where at -- the transition moment that the President identified as July 2011 is the point that he believes we should begin that transition, and begin to -- I think you heard Secretary Gates say today -- we have build, we have hold, but, importantly, we have transfer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we are not going to be there forever.\xc2\xa0 The President said that.\xc2\xa0 The folks testifying today said that.\xc2\xa0 This is not an open-ended commitment.\xc2\xa0 We are going to provide them with the incentives that they need via this transition point to get their act together, to train that security force and army so that, beginning in July 2011, we can transfer the responsibility of Afghan security to the Afghans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what\'s fundamentally important about this.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes, based on the decision that he made, that this is the best course forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld took issue with a lot of the speech last night, and I just wanted to clarify it.\xc2\xa0 The President said: "Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive."\xc2\xa0 I assume you\'re referring to the McKiernan requests throughout 2008, yes?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s I believe what the speech -- the line in the speech -- I will let Secretary Rumsfeld explain to you and to others whether he thinks that the effort in Afghanistan was sufficiently resourced during his tenure as Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- that\'s something that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he\'s not aware of a single request of that nature between 2001 and 2006 when he was Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ll let him explain to the American public whether he believes that the effort in Afghanistan during 2001 to 2006 was appropriately resourced.\xc2\xa0 You go to war with the Secretary of Defense you have, Jake.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s cute.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The question, though, is what specifically was President Obama talking about when he said that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, what President Obama was talking about --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was talking about the whole war?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- were additional resource requests that came in during 2008, which we\'ve discussed in here.\xc2\xa0 But, Jake, again, I\'ll leave it to the Secretary of Defense in 2001 to 2006 to discuss the level of resourcing for that, understanding the level of commitment that we already had dedicated in Iraq, and whether or not he feels sufficient that history will judge the resourcing decisions that he made during that time period in the war in Afghanistan were or were not sufficient.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Some progressive Democrats on the Hill have said today that they think that the President should pursue a war authorization for this surge of troops.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys thinking about doing that at all, or do you think the 2001 authorization <br/>\n--</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made very clear last evening that -- why we are there now.\xc2\xa0 The conditions for what happened on September 11th brought our forces, through an almost unanimous vote of Congress, to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And obviously that is inordinately -- that\'s plenty sufficient to -- for what the President is talking about.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I may, just one more.\xc2\xa0 In his March speech, President Obama mentioned that if the Taliban returns to controlling Afghanistan, it would be bad for human rights, and he specifically singled out women and girls.\xc2\xa0 He did not mention human rights in Afghanistan -- he talked about human rights more broadly, but last night he didn\'t mention human rights in Afghanistan, and he definitely didn\'t mention specifically women and girls.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe in the context of the three pillars that he saw, mentioning the basic recognition of human rights in Afghanistan is obviously important to what is happening there.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\'t mention women and girls.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the umbrella of basic human rights was the same thing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even though he mentioned it in March and he didn\'t mention it last night, we\'re not supposed to read anything into that at all?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t.\xc2\xa0 Again, I have not looked exactly at the word phrasing of each speech, but the umbrella of basic -- recognizing the basic human rights of everybody in Afghanistan would include that, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, since there\'s this 2011 drawdown date, is there a high degree of certainty that there will be stability in Afghanistan by that time, or is stability less of an issue and more of the local Afghan forces are able to handle the situation, whatever it may be?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t -- I think you\'re going to -- I don\'t think you can have one, honestly, without the other, Dan.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and I\'d refer you to the testimony that Secretary Gates gave today, which he believed what we had laid out was very achievable in the transition time frame that the President spoke about last night.\xc2\xa0 Again, we -- part of that is to build in an incentivizing for the Afghans to do what they need to do.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nWe can\'t, and we won\'t, be there forever.\xc2\xa0 The role of providing security for the Afghans will have to rest primarily with Afghan national security forces.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what this new dedication of resources will do, is accelerate that training.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately the President believes, the team believes, in developing that time frame that those conditions will be met.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But ultimately then it\'s up to the Afghans to really run that timeline, right, because if they don\'t come up to speed then do you leave at that point?\xc2\xa0 Do you still draw down at that point?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no -- but, again -- well, we\'re there to make sure that it happens.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why -- again, let\'s -- just for some historical, we started -- when the President, as he mentioned last night, put his hand on the Bible on January 20th, we had roughly 32,000 men and women in uniform in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That has increased to roughly 68,000 by the end of the summer of 2009.\xc2\xa0 And by the end of the summer of 2010 we\'ll have an additional 30,000 to that.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve basically got a triple -- triple the resources -- basically you do -- you have triple the resources over that two-year time period in order to accelerate that training.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That training will be assessed, benchmarks will be laid down so that we can ensure that on a very frequent basis -- and certainly looking back annually to the goals that are set -- that we are achieving the level of training necessary to do what this plan envisions doing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, the Secretary of Defense and those that testified today, as well as those that helped develop that policy going forward, believe that it\'s achievable in the time frame that the President enunciated last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen the President in the past, when he rolls any new initiative -- whether it be health care or stimulus, whatever it might be -- he always takes it on the road to really sell it to the American people.\xc2\xa0 He\'s not doing anything today, nothing that we know of this week.\xc2\xa0 Is he planning to go out there and push this new strategy to the American people, beyond just the speech last night.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ve got an important event tomorrow in the jobs forum; we\'ve got activities on Friday in Allentown, to talk about jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate -- that schedule is largely, obviously, set.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate, though, that the President -- I think you\'ve seen him say this -- I think the President understands that explaining why we\'re there, why the decision was made, how we came to that decision, and what it means for both the American people and the Afghan people is not a one-shot deal; that we are going to have to continually talk to the American people and give them updates and assessments on where we are.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have anything specifically laid out on the schedule for that, but I anticipate he\'ll continue to do that throughout the remainder of this year and next.</p>\n<p>Helen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President ignore the fact that you have oil pipelines -- or protecting oil pipelines in Afghanistan may be the reason we\'re staying there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did he ignore -- I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t mention oil pipelines.\xc2\xa0 Does that have anything to do with his decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve never heard that come up in the, say, nine or ten meetings that I was in.\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Again, I think, Helen, just to go through what the President said last night, as a result of a Taliban-provided safe haven for al Qaeda, 19 men hijacked four planes and murdered nearly 3,000 people on September 11, 2001 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The previous administration acts like it had really brought that part under control.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to keep referring to 9/11 --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as Jake mentioned, in the authorization to go into Afghanistan was as a result, quite clearly, of the activities of al Qaeda in a Taliban-provided safe haven in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'re in Afghanistan right now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing.\xc2\xa0 You said you\'re going to make an end run around Karzai and go to other --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- go ahead, I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if he doesn\'t measure up.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you do that?\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that an intervention in a sovereign country?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you are.\xc2\xa0 We are.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this -- we have a plan that incentivizes actions, whether it\'s training security forces, whether it\'s improving governance.\xc2\xa0 If those that are responsible at their different level are providing the services that a government has to and needs to provide its people, then we\'ll have a great relationship with working with those people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If those people -- hold on, let me just finish.\xc2\xa0 If those people don\'t, then we will find people that will.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because we have -- we will have, by sometime next year, by the middle of next year, 98,000 American men and women in addition to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s their country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But, Helen, I think if you -- if you ask the Afghan government whether they want us to be there right now helping train their national security force and helping to root out the insurgency and the Taliban, they\'d say, yes, they approve of us being there, quite clearly.\xc2\xa0 I think what\'s important is, understanding -- they understand that we\'re not going to be there forever; that they are going to change their behavior in order to take ultimate responsibility for their country because our commitment is not open-ended.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what right do you have to demand of a sovereign country what they do?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Helen, there\'s an authorization that allows us to do the military activities from a congressional standpoint.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think if you ask President Karzai and others whether we\'re there and they\'d like us to be there, the answer to that is yes.\xc2\xa0 What we want them to understand is there can\'t be a permanent dependence on us being there; that we are going to incentivize, again, through changes in governance and in training, putting onto them the responsibility of both running a government that meets the needs of the people and training and equipping a security force that will provide the necessary security to prevent the Taliban from overthrowing the government, as the President said, or creating a safe haven that would allow al Qaeda to return and plan and plot another attack on our homeland.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe you must have the support of the American people to prosecute a war?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that throughout this process it will be important to talk to the American people about, as he did last night, why we were there, what we hope to achieve, and when we\'re going to come home.\xc2\xa0 I think the President laid out why we\'re there, the importance of why we\'re there, and the consequences of our efforts.\xc2\xa0 I think that the American people I think wanted to know that hard decisions were made, hard choices were looked at, and this policy and its questions were reviewed intensively, and that happened over this process.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to pay attention to whether that\'s -- right now, clearly, the majority of Americans don\'t support sending more troops over there.\xc2\xa0 Will he be listening to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what poll are you -- I mean, most of -- well, let me say this, because I\'m not going to get into this.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t make a national security decision last night or in the previous days leading up to last night based on polling.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he did make clear that he believes he can convince the American people that this is the right way to go, and if he fails to convince them will that affect his decision to proceed?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I\'ll leave at this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes the decision -- clearly the decision that he\'s made is the right decision and that he\'d like to tell the American people why he believes that decision is right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the support --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t think this is a one-shot deal.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that -- look, I\'m sure any number of your news organizations will call their polling centers tonight and poll reaction to the President\'s speech, adding more troops, this and that.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t a one-shot deal.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking instantaneous, I\'m talking over the coming months, if public support is still low for sending these troops is the President going to reconsider on that basis?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to reconsider -- we didn\'t make the decision based on political polling; we\'re not going to look at the polls and make decisions going forward based on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip, the President was asked this yesterday in some stuff that he did -- if we looked at political polls before we made decisions it\'s very likely that the financial system would have suffered collapse.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very likely that there would be exactly one domestic auto company.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re talking --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, hold it, let me finish --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and having --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- no, no, no, let me finish.\xc2\xa0 There would be one domestic auto company, and maybe we would have pulled out of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Understand the President didn\'t believe that our financial system collapsing, did not believe the collapse of two out of the three auto companies in this country was wise, nor does he think -- obviously based on the decision that he made, as he said last night, leaving Afghanistan -- that any of those things are in our national interest.\xc2\xa0 They may not poll well at any given point, but that\'s not the decision the President makes. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t call his pollster in to make a policy decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sending troops into harm\'s way is different.\xc2\xa0 When I interviewed him recently I said, and he agreed with the concept that you can\'t wage a war without the support of the American people.\xc2\xa0 Does he still agree with that?\xc2\xa0 And if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t convince them to support him in this, will he continue anyway?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President believes and is anxious to continue talking with the American people, as he did last night, about why he thinks this is the best way.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip, your network and four other networks didn\'t give precious network time willy-nilly.\xc2\xa0 They gave it because they understand the importance of this decision and the President wanted to talk to the American people about it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on one other thing?\xc2\xa0 In the hearing today with Gates and Mullen and Clinton -- forgive my informality -- people really tried to nail down this July 2011 date, what it really is.\xc2\xa0 And Lindsey Graham -- in an exchange with Lindsey Graham, the Secretary of Defense said, "It\'s our plan."\xc2\xa0 And another senator called it a "target."\xc2\xa0 And there was no specific disagreement.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House agree with that description of the July 2011 -- that it\'s a "target" and a "plan"?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 July 2011 is the point in which the President believes our troops are going to begin to transition out and the responsibility of security is going to go -- beginning to go in certain places to the Afghans.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You would disagree with the idea that it\'s a "target"\xc2\xa0 -- that word should not be used --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not look at those particular points in the hearing, and I\'m not necessarily sure that each of the characterizations that you set up are contradictory.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Robert, just to follow up, you just said he believes at that point that we would --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- well, yes.\xc2\xa0 The policy is -- let me be clear, let me be clear, because the President was clear -- our forces, in July of 2011, will transition out of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Again, understand what he said:\xc2\xa0 This is a conditions-based drawdown, decisions made by the Commander-in-Chief, but that\'s -- understand where we\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s understand where we got to July 2011.\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about roughly a two-year time period between where most of the increased number of troops that were either in the pipeline or that the President authorized at the end of March -- okay -- so for at least a two-year period of time, right, from let\'s say roughly July 2009 to July 2011, you will have had at least an increase of roughly 35,000 forces over that two-year period of time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over a one-year period of time -- again, roughly July 2010 to July 2011 -- you\'ll have, give or take, a few thousand that come in and come out, an increase of 63,000 troops for that time. That is in excess -- that is a time period greatly in excess of what we saw in Iraq, with a troop delta -- a change in troops greatly in excess of what we saw in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a drawdown will begin in July -- of some magnitude will be --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A conditions-based --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if conditions warrant?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A conditions-based drawdown will begin in July 2011.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If they warrant.\xc2\xa0 But if they don\'t --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what does that mean?\xc2\xa0 The beginning of conditions-based or the pace afterwards --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the pacing and the slope of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Afterwards.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we are transitioning, in July of 2011, from Americans providing the primary security -- we are giving that responsibility to an Afghan national security force that we have trained over this 18- to 24-month period, putting them in the lead and transitioning our forces out.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the pace of that will be dependent on the conditions?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the pacing of that, which --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the transition will not be in any way changed or pushed back?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s the date that the President outlined last night.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gates today said the President always has the freedom to adjust that date.\xc2\xa0 Do you disagree?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t disagree with that, but I\'d listen quite clearly to what the President said last evening.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President brought up the $30 billion figure as how much this is going to cost, but he didn\'t get into the details of how --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t anticipate that that\'s going to be gotten into in the next couple days, understanding --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just going to -- what is the time frame of this?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys working with Congress?\xc2\xa0 How is this going to work?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to work inside here and with Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was clear that -- obviously the Pentagon, through its assessments and through its advice, denoted the importance of what we\'re doing in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The President has dedicated additional resources, and we\'re going to have to both account for and pay for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this something that you believe that if you have to do deficit spending, you have to do it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in all honesty, Chuck, I don\'t think there\'s ever been a military conflict in the history of our country where that hasn\'t happened.\xc2\xa0 Now, the difference being, we\'re going to have to account for this.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 We have a change in our fiscal situation over the previous eight years not -- partly because, through a process there was no accounting for an increased amount of war spending.\xc2\xa0 As the President said last night, we spent, during this time period before he got into office, roughly a trillion dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That has to be accounted for as part of our fiscal situation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How quickly do you think you\'re going to be asking Congress for this supplemental?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that OMB here and the Pentagon are clearly going to look at what amount of funding is currently -- what amount of funding is currently there, for how long, and then obviously some of this working with the comptroller in terms of the logistics of when, how, and where troops arrive.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it will be in a supplemental?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a question now --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- and not one that I think --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not been decided yet?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been clear on where this has been in the past.\xc2\xa0 But no decisions have been made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to change topics.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned with the shakeup at General Motors in the leadership?\xc2\xa0 They\'ve now gone through their second CEO.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a government-backed board that fired the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 We made -- we insisted on structural changes in order for increased assistance to ensure that the company didn\'t go bankrupt -- or bankrupt -- obviously they went into a structured bankruptcy, but you know what I mean.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I think Fritz Henderson has done a good job in a period of transition, but the board of directors runs General Motors, not the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you guys given a heads up about this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe at some point somebody probably knew, but we were not involved in any of those decisions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other topic.\xc2\xa0 Is Desiree Rogers going to go to Capitol Hill tomorrow and testify?\xc2\xa0 She\'s been invited.\xc2\xa0 Has she made a decision?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No -- well, first of all, I think that -- obviously there\'s an ongoing assessment and investigation by the Secret Service into what happened I guess a little more than a week ago.\xc2\xa0 We are working with and are ready to work with anybody that has questions on that.\xc2\xa0 I think you know that, based on the separation of powers, staff here don\'t go to testify in front of Congress.\xc2\xa0 She won\'t -- she will not be testifying in front of Congress tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me add on to this.\xc2\xa0 One of the -- as the Secret Service has reviewed their security procedures for how people get into this complex, so, too, has the White House looked at its procedures.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you guys have done your own review?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have done an assessment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me -- you guys are impatient today. One of the things that -- and I mentioned this yesterday in interviews that I did on all of your television shows -- was that we would assess whether or not all of what we were doing was being done in support of what the Secret Service has to do as part of their mission of keeping this complex safe.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nLast night was the first of many holiday parties that will happen in this complex over the next several weeks.\xc2\xa0 We had staff at the security checkpoint to ensure that if there was any confusion about lists, those would be double-checked with somebody representing the Social Office.\xc2\xa0 That was an assessment made based on something that we believed could have been added, and we\'ve made those changes as of last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow up, Robert, on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been any concerns about Desiree Rogers\' performance prior to this instance?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No one has questioned the President or told the President that she is a very last-minute person, poor planner?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think you -- you all have been to and seen, either whether you\'re part of a pool, whether some of you have been to receptions, the remarkable work that they have done in pulling off a lot of events here.\xc2\xa0 The First Family is quite pleased with her performance, and I\'ve heard nothing uttered of what you talk about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what about the issues of her being in fashion spreads early on in the administration?\xc2\xa0 Did you put the brakes on that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that is -- it\'s been raised, it\'s now public, you saw it in the magazines, her pictorals.\xc2\xa0 You saw her on the cover --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I get Sports Illustrated at my house.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t\xc2\xa0 -- I don\'t get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But could you talk -- seriously, could you talk about that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was there a concern in this White House that she came out being -- some might have called here the belle of the ball, overshadowing the First Lady at the beginning --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know who "some" are.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve never heard that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s been bantered around Washington, and it\'s been in circles -- Democratic circles as well as Republican circles, high-ranking people.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, that\'s not a station I live in in life --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- administrations as well.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just answer the question, please.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you done speaking so I can?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, I\'m done now, yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not heard any of that criticism.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not read any of that criticism.\xc2\xa0 The President, the First Lady, and the entire White House staff are grateful for the job that she does and think she has done a terrific and wonderful job pulling off a lot of big and important events here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did she invite herself to the state dinner or was she a guest -- did the President invite her, or did she put her -- no, that\'s a real -- do not fan it off.\xc2\xa0 I\'m serious -- no, seriously.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, did she invite herself, or did the President ask her -- her name was on that list, and social secretaries are the ones who put the names on the list.\xc2\xa0 Did she invite herself or did the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Was she at the dinner?\xc2\xa0 April, April, calm down. Just take a deep breath for one second.\xc2\xa0 See?\xc2\xa0 This happens with my son, he does the same thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t play with me, I\'m being serious.\xc2\xa0 Do not blow it off.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m giving you a serious answer.\xc2\xa0 Was she at the dinner?\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was she an invited guest?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 She\'s the social secretary.\xc2\xa0 She had the primary --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Social secretaries are not guests of the dinner.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 She is the primary -- for running the dinner.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to get back to weightier topics like 98,000 men and women in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jonathan, take us away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, April, please forgive me if I ask this question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Can you take us back to the November 11th Wednesday meeting when the President came and said he wasn\'t happy with the options that he was presented?\xc2\xa0 Is that when the staff began working on a more rapid -- a more rapid deployment strategy, and is that when the July 2011 date started to come -- tell us the advent of the July 2011 date.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- look, I think as a structure of this policy in general -- and I don\'t -- I can see who has notes or go back and look at some of my notes -- I don\'t know whether\xc2\xa0 -- I mean, July 2011 -- I\'m sorry, November 11th was a time period -- as I characterize it, the President was dissatisfied with options that were put in front of him.\xc2\xa0 But throughout this process, Jonathan, the President asked for, and I think everybody involved -- and you can see that certainly from Secretary Gates\' testimony today -- first and foremost a strategy and a mission was agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 After that -- after you pick a strategy, you have to resource that strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know whether it was the 11th or what have you, but throughout this process -- and again, this is what Secretary Gates said -- "This approach is not open-ended nation-building.\xc2\xa0 It\'s neither necessary nor feasible to create a modern, centralized Western-style Afghan nation state, the likes of which has never been seen in that country.\xc2\xa0 Nor does it entail pacifying every village and conducting textbook counterinsurgency from one end of Afghanistan to the other."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the course of this -- and again, I\'d have to go back and look at different inflection points -- but the President, on different occasions, discussed not being happy with the options that he had.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether it was on the November -- during the November 11th meeting.\xc2\xa0 I do remember very clearly the President asking the planners whether or not we could get forces in there faster than what had previously been on force flow sheets -- understanding that original assessments had force flow for well into year two of -- on a time continuum.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President sought, in a more narrow mission, a series of resources that he believed fit that narrow mission and a timeline for getting them there quicker.\xc2\xa0 Obviously as part of that -- and as I talked about with Jennifer and others -- we, with this transition point, have set up a time period in which the team believes it is achievable to train that Afghan national security force and begin the transition of responsibility in providing security.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you give us any sense of where and when the July 2011 inflection point originated from?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Throughout the process, but I\'d have to go back and look more detailed at my notes.\xc2\xa0 I will say -- well, let me go back and see what folks have in terms of the notes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that, Robert?\xc2\xa0 Did the considerations have to do with how much -- how long the President thought Americans might tolerate this surge?\xc2\xa0 Or was it a military assessment?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a military assessment.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, Secretary Gates says what we have is a time frame, a mission and a set of resources that all work to make what the President outlined achievable.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I try again?\xc2\xa0 On July 2011, what if that date shows up and the judgment is made that Afghan forces aren\'t ready to assume responsibility?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not going to get deeply into hypotheticals for something that is almost two years away.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have -- again, going through the history of this -- an increase of at least 35,000 troops for at least two years on this July 2009 to July 2011 continuum, an additional 60-plus-thousand troops in that one-year period.\xc2\xa0 He believes and the team believes that is a sufficient time in order to train Afghan national security forces to assume control of providing security.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I do want to address this because I have seen this in a couple -- where people have said, well, isn\'t the Taliban just going to wait you out?\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important that we dispense with what I can\'t even wrap my head around being a logical argument, okay?\xc2\xa0 If I understand the argument correctly, there\'s a insurgent -- insurgency that they say is gaining real estate and momentum.\xc2\xa0 So by the President saying July 2011, what we\'re doing with the insurgency, according to what, again, I consider to be a highly illogical argument, these people are going to recede into the woods, they\'re going to give up their land, they\'re going to give up what they control, they\'re going to stop fighting, and they\'re going to go away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if that\'s the case, great.\xc2\xa0 That would be the best outcome, because American forces would then take that real estate.\xc2\xa0 We would then have the space, even greater space, to train an Afghan national security force, so that if they want to come back in July 2011 and start this process over again, they\'ll meet a far larger Afghan national security force to take them on.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The argument, in and of itself, is completely illogical.\xc2\xa0 It makes absolutely no sense.\xc2\xa0 If you subscribe to the notion that an insurgency has momentum, that they\'re controlling a certain amount of important real estate -- again, if that\'s the case, then I\'m here to say, disperse and we\'ll take what you have.\xc2\xa0 Then it doesn\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bring it on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no -- no, no, because -- it\'s not cocky. It\'s the logic of -- basically if they had 40 percent of this room and we said, well, we\'re going to be here until -- we\'re going to be here for another month and then they left, we would take that part of the room.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the logic does not in any way fit.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a great and wonderful illustrative illogical canard.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but that was the prior administration\'s argument against setting a timeline in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But even if they had, do we think that the insurgency in Iraq would have disappeared?\xc2\xa0 Do we think they would have said, you know what, what we\'re doing is we have this amazing ramp-up in kinetic and violent activities.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve gone to all this trouble to do this.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re going to tell us you\'re going to be here until X time, so then we\'re going to go home, we\'re going to go away, we\'re going to go back to our houses and just wait until some date and then we\'re going to come back and do that.\xc2\xa0 The illogical nature of it is you\'re giving up what you\'ve then gained.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify the funding stuff.\xc2\xa0 And if you haven\'t made a decision, that\'s fine, but in terms of a supplemental versus folding it into the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That has not -- that\'s a bridge not yet crossed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Will that be crossed before the February 1 budget, before the end of this year?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Let me shift gears real quick.\xc2\xa0 I know you guys just put something out on the jobs summit tomorrow, and you guys have talked a little bit about this, but what sort of criteria went into the companies you selected, who you guys brought in here?\xc2\xa0 Aren\'t members of Congress -- they have been here at some of the other summits.\xc2\xa0 What was some of the thinking?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can get more detail on this, but obviously what the President is looking forward to tomorrow is having a broad discussion with, and getting ideas from, a whole host of people in the private sector -- people that run fairly large companies, like FedEx, Google; small business owners that -- the engine of our economy that do most of our hiring; financial experts; others that have ideas.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The government alone is not going to create and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the primary responsibility to create the jobs that will get our economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the private sector.\xc2\xa0 What I think the President wants to do is hear from them on the type of environment that we can have that would allow for that hiring to take place.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\'s very much looking forward to that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that will continue in Allentown and throughout next week.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, currently the Chamber of Commerce and NFIB are not invited.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a review of that, or if that\'s a final decision, why not have either one of those two at the event tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know whether FedEx or Google or the small business owners that are represented there are members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, their local chamber of commerce or the NFIB.\xc2\xa0 I hesitate -- I think it\'s pretty clear to say that chambers of commerce throughout this country and small business owners throughout this country will be represented.\xc2\xa0 But there\'s no -- I don\'t know why any decision would be reviewed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not really necessary for them to be a part of submitting ideas to this process of looking for job creation?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think -- if I\'m not mistaken they announced, like, a $20 million ad campaign to do that.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know that they need a -- I have a TV in my office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I know.\xc2\xa0 But an ad campaign is different from having a conversation within the confines of this property and with the President on job creation.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if you consider that ad campaign an act of hostility that cancels them out of a process to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve got a campaign about how they want to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think the President shares the goal of creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think whether it\'s a small business, whether they\'re a member or not of the NFIB -- this is like a -- this is one of these little Washington deals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an end run around the Chamber\'s leadership, correct, I mean, going directly to their members?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hesitate to say -- do you think FedEx is a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the point --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, hold on.\xc2\xa0 Do you think they are?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In my recollection, FedEx is, in fact, a dues-paying member of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I assume if somebody has something to say, they\'ll say it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert, the question is --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can we get on to something semi-pertinent?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, this is pertinent.\xc2\xa0 You guys --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Chamber of Commerce doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any more pertinent.<br/>\nIt\'s a question of whether or not they\'re being invited, whether or not the leadership --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it specifically supposed to be semi-pertinent or do you want it be pertinent?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For today, let\'s go with semi.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Semi-pertinent?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He gets a free question for that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people have analyzed the number of troops available to deploy and said that sending 30,000 troops is tantamount to deploying nearly every U.S. Army brigade possible. Given that about 10,000 soldiers are already in stop-loss, do you know where Defense Secretary Gates is with his review of softening the discharges on "don\'t ask, don\'t tell"?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not heard an update from the Secretary on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that obviously the President wants that policy changed.\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- I mean, obviously it\'s not just Army.\xc2\xa0 This is Army and Marines, as well as -- well, Army and Marines.\xc2\xa0 They are -- this was very specifically asked in terms of whether force flow options would interrupt either Marine or Army policies that have been instituted to give longer breaks for tours of duty and then return home.\xc2\xa0 The Joint Chiefs, to a commander, all told the Commander-in-Chief that they could meet the force requirement without interrupting what they had instituted in order to provide that time at home and away from the tour of duty.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the troops are stretched thin.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s not --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No doubt.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the President was very clear in wanting to see the Joint Chiefs to, quite frankly, ask them very directly whether that was the case.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt that there has been for many, many years a strain on our forces; that that strain has caused repeated tours.\xc2\xa0 And only recently has Secretary Gates and others instituted policies that ensure that we had time outside of a theater of war and that they believe was necessary to maintain an all-volunteer force, which they think obviously is tremendously important, as well as just dealing with the stress physically and mentally on them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House reaction to the way congressional Democrats have received the strategy and the speech?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- I mean, I\'ve seen obviously reactions from across the political spectrum and within the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the concern in such has been expressed to the President for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was not in the congressional meeting yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I was in the previous one, and I think a lot of this was brought up -- their concern for what this would do to our force, what this would do -- what this meant budgetarily and so forth.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think there\'s any doubt that -- some of this was not unexpected. <br/>\nAgain, I think what the President wants to do both with the public and with members of Congress is continue to talk to them about why he thinks the decision he made was important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he confident that they could be brought around, the key congressional committee leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say I think he hopes that he will continue to talk to them and certainly get their advice about moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes the decision he made was the right one and will continue to try to make sure they understand that.</p>\n<p>Sheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The President was deeply involved, obviously, in creating this policy, and I\'m wondering, how does he envision his role going forward in the implementation?\xc2\xa0 People who have worked for President Bush said that after the surge -- the Iraq surge was announced in January 2007, President Bush had weekly meetings with Petraeus, Crocker, Secretary Gates and others for the remainder of his term, and that the implementation of the Afghanistan strategy would require a similar sustained involvement by the President.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, what does President Obama see as his involvement going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- let me ask some of the folks at NSC. Obviously there\'s a structure that will be set up to measure a series of benchmarks.\xc2\xa0 The President receives and is in regular contact with -- obviously sees Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen each week here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 He sees and has seen General Petraeus somewhat regularly and receives both military and political updates each week from Ambassador Hill, General Odierno in Iraq, from Ambassador Eikenberry and General McChrystal in Afghanistan, and has for as long as I can remember.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if any --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he get those by videoconference or a --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sometimes they\'re video, but there is a weekly written packet that goes into NSC in the White House, again, each week.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there\'s anything -- anything will be layered on to do that.\xc2\xa0 Again, suffice to say the President has spent a lot of time, not just over the course of the last couple of months in devising the way forward, but dating back to the transition and certainly in the initial review through the end of March, and was deeply involved both in a trip to Iraq and in continued discussions in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when you talk about training of the security forces, are we still talking a national army as opposed to militias that can be deployed in certain provinces?\xc2\xa0 And will NATO be involved in the training efforts?\xc2\xa0 And why the administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ask more Arab countries at least to do the training part of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on the last part, on Arab countries in terms of training.\xc2\xa0 I do believe -- well, let me not -- I don\'t want to get past my ski tips on that.\xc2\xa0 Let me check in terms of the contributions from some in a large coalition already.</p>\n<p>Obviously NATO has played and will continue to play an important role in training both an Afghan national army and an Afghan national police force, both of which are part of the larger umbrella of Afghan national security forces.\xc2\xa0 Different countries in NATO have done that, and I can only imagine that increased contributions that will come to this effort, part of that will be men and women dedicated specifically to training.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on the third part of it.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 In terms of this humanitarian funding, I\'m just curious, are you concerned about money being siphoned through corrupt individuals that are part of the Afghan government that will actually give it out to the Taliban?\xc2\xa0 And how would you incentivize to make sure that doesn\'t happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think many of what -- much of what I talked to Jennifer about on the very question -- we have to -- the President has been clear with President Karzai, both in his recent meeting over the secure video teleconference and phone call after the -- right after he was declared the winner and the next continued President of Afghanistan, that corruption very directly had to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into the flow of any of that, but suffice it to say that we\'re making very determined resource commitments both in manpower and in money, from American service members and American taxpayers, that we expect will be used for the purpose they were appropriated for, not for lining the pockets of somebody\'s friend.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on something -- to clarify something earlier, did anyone in an office here at the White House in the days leading up to the India state visit request clearance information for the Salahis in case there was space available for them to attend the arrival ceremony?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the days leading up to the India state visit, did anyone at the White House request the actual clearance information for the Salahis in case --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with somebody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, if you would.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- this is what it looks like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 But let me just -- I think what\'s important is, you\'ve got to have an invitation to get into the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t bring your invitation to the door, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure you do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You bring your driver\'s license.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But if you don\'t have one of these, you can\'t get into the door, April.\xc2\xa0 If you have a driver\'s license but you didn\'t have one of these then you weren\'t at the dinner.\xc2\xa0 You got to have one of these to get in the dinner.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an invitation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to confirm, my question is --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have somebody check this out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if they were under the impression they were being invited, if they could have gotten into --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, nobody would have let anybody into the -- under the impression that they had been invited to the dinner because there was no --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asking about the Salahis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, I will double-check.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get that on eBay?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t tell Lester, but it actually is addressed to the Honorable Robert Gibbs.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Desir\xc3\xa9e Rogers-- after she invited herself for the President?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Desir\xc3\xa9e Rogers get the invitation by inviting herself for the President --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 This one says Robert Gibbs and he had a driver\'s license and got in.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did she invite herself or did the President invite her?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It said the Honorable Robert -- Sheryl, I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on what you said earlier about that you\'ve changed the practice and now a Social Secretary -- a person from the office of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A staff member representing the Social Secretary\'s Office, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- will be at the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was that a decision made by the Social Secretary\'s Office?\xc2\xa0 In other words -- or did the Secret Service make that call?\xc2\xa0 Who determines --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was based on an assessment and a review of our procedures made by Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And can I -- just previously, when it was determined that it was not needed to have a Social Secretary representative at the gate, was that determination made by the Social Secretary\'s Office or by the Secret Service?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about previous decisions.\xc2\xa0 I know Jim looked at whether we were doing enough to complement the work that the brave men and women do of the Secret Service in ensuring the protection of the President, his family, and, quite frankly, anybody that attends an event here, and decided that to ensure that we would add staff.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But in administrations past there was a staff member there and then for this dinner there wasn\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering who made that call.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the jobs forum, do you expect this to lead to a bill in Congress or actions that the White House can take unilaterally?\xc2\xa0 And is there a deadline for getting something done?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President will continue to talk about this into next week with a speech about some of the ideas that his economic team have been looking at.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that some of the ideas that are talked about will probably be in that speech.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether or not -- obviously this is a pretty full plate with Capitol Hill, whether -- I don\'t know what the legislative calendar is for getting something done this year.\xc2\xa0 I know the President -- we have an upcoming unemployment report and I know the President is anxious to -- has asked the economic team to do whatever is possible to create the conditions for increased job hiring, and I think that\'s what will be explored at the forum and, again, in Allentown.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Republican whip Eric Cantor outlined some proposals today such as stopping new regulations on business and freezing any tax increases.\xc2\xa0 Are any of those the sort of ideas that you all could agree on?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if anybody has got ideas I think folks would be happy to look at them, and I\'m sure people will.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything?\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just in light of the recent push by organizations like the NAACP and La Raza for the President to focus more on jobs, at the summit tomorrow are there any sessions to be focused on the higher unemployment rate in minority communities?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that obviously that will be part of -- I believe that will be part of the discussion.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be folks representing a lot of different groups.\xc2\xa0 There will be mayors that will be here that obviously have a keen interest and awareness in this, and I anticipate that that will be something that\'s discussed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you detail to what extent, if any, the White House\'s Afghan strategy will involve negotiating with Taliban leaders as a way of compelling them to drop their insurgent threats --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Taliban leaders --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, but negotiate with --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leaders of the Taliban or insurgent leaders as a way to compel them to drop their threat, as opposed to militaristic means?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would direct you to either COMISAF or the Pentagon on the exact implementation of -- but, again, I think you\'ve heard General Petraeus discuss efforts in both Iraq and now Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And the President outlined last night the notion that if there are those that are willing to walk away from the type of activity they\'ve been involved in, reintegration into society is certainly possible.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s only after walking away from the Taliban?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I was -- I\'ll check with people that were in the videoconference with the Prime Minister on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:28 P.M.
