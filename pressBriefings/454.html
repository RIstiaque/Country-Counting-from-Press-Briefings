EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I know we have a couple of Minnesotans on board, so I know there\xe2\x80\x99s particular excitement back here about our ultimate destination this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to the Twin Cities, where the President will have the chance to answer in person a letter he received from a working mom from Saint Anthony, Minnesota.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk with her about the challenges facing her family and what they have in common with millions of hardworking middle-class families across the country.</p>\n<p>Now, as you know, there are many people who work full-time but aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the middle class because they\xe2\x80\x99re paid the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to raise the minimum wage, because he believes that if you\xe2\x80\x99re working full-time you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to raise your family in poverty.\xc2\xa0 Since the President issued his call to raise the minimum wage and took executive action to raise the minimum wage for employees of federal contractors, at least six states, including Minnesota, have raised the minimum wage.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMany companies have also acted on their own and announced plans to raise the minimum wage for their workers.\xc2\xa0 Just today, Ikea announced that they were raising their employees\xe2\x80\x99 wages.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a step that\xe2\x80\x99s been taken by large companies like Gap, and small companies like Pi Pizzeria from St. Louis, because it\xe2\x80\x99s good for their bottom line, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for employee retention and recruitment, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for productivity.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is we should do it for every worker across America, because it would also be good for our economy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of a commonsense policy being blocked by Republicans in Congress that would expand economic opportunity for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 That, after all, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top domestic priority, and it\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about here in Minnesota over the next couple of days.\xc2\xa0 Hard work should lead to a decent living.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to make sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s possible for every working family in America.</p>\n<p>So with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll start with your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction on the Supreme Court ruling on recess appointments?\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of -- I mean, they obviously did not think that what he did was constitutional.\xc2\xa0 What does he think about next steps?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, let me start by saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re of course deeply disappointed in today\xe2\x80\x99s decision and are still reviewing it.\xc2\xa0 We are, however, pleased that the Court recognized the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority -- as exercised by Presidents going all the way back to George Washington -- to fill vacancies when the Senate fails to act.</p>\n<p>I should note that the decision, which we\xe2\x80\x99re still reviewing, does preserve some important elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority, and he will not hesitate to use it to move the country forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just to back up a little bit.\xc2\xa0 You now have the Supreme Court ruling unanimously that the President exceeded his authority, and one chamber of Congress suing the President for exceeding his authority.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reflection by the President about whether perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s pushing the limits a little bit too far?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I mean, frankly, we disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still reviewing it, but of course we\xe2\x80\x99ll honor it.\xc2\xa0 The President, though, remains committed to using every element of his executive authority to make progress on behalf of middle-class families across the country.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that this is a controversial topic for some Republicans in Congress who have tried to block legislatively every effort, including bipartisan efforts, to make progress on behalf of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>It was announced earlier this week that some Republicans were going to take the extraordinary step of suing the President, to stop him from doing his job.\xc2\xa0 The President has in the last few months announced executive actions that would raise the minimum wage; that would reduce carbon pollution; that would make it easier for people to repay their student loans.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing for Republicans to try to block legislative remedies to those problems.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s yet another for Republicans to go to court to say that the President can\xe2\x80\x99t act to solve those problems.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not why they were sent to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that there is broad agreement among Democrats and Republicans across the country that they would rather see their elected leaders in Washington, D.C., work together to make progress on behalf of working families across the country as opposed to resorting to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to try to stop the President from making progress on behalf of middle-class families all across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Optically, though, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried that this plays into Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s hand when he\xe2\x80\x99s making political arguments that the President is overstepping his authority?\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried that the court decision is going to make people think, well, maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s something to what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are still reviewing the decision.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that there are elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority that were upheld by the Supreme Court, including some authority that\xe2\x80\x99s been exercised by Presidents going all the way back to George Washington.</p>\n<p>So the President is in no way considering scaling back his efforts to make progress for the American people.\xc2\xa0 That is something that he is determined to do.\xc2\xa0 We would much prefer to work in bipartisan fashion with Congress to get that done.\xc2\xa0 But if Congress refuses to act, the President will not hesitate to act on his own.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President met with Senate Dems yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Did he preview any next steps on these executive actions, perhaps on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yesterday was primarily an opportunity for the President to spend some time talking with Senate Democrats about his legislative agenda and some of the priorities that they share for moving the country forward.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details of that meeting to read out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there were -- let me say it this way:\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a strategy session.\xc2\xa0 This more was an opportunity for the President to sit down with Democrats and to talk about some of his priorities, but also to hear from them about some steps that they think that we should be taking to advance our domestic agenda in particular.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But if we have more steps to announce that the President is willing to take through his executive authority to make progress for middle-class families, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on that.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t been shy about sharing that information with you either.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, another major court ruling this morning striking down buffer zones outside of abortion clinics.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a reaction to that ruling?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about that ruling.\xc2\xa0 This was the second decision that was handed down by the Supreme Court today, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in a position to get our full analysis of this.\xc2\xa0 So if we have an announcement or a reaction to this we can share, it will probably come from my colleagues at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn enough about the case before the plane took off this morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how much of today\xe2\x80\x99s visit and this series of trips is about politics?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President has already said that some of the priorities he will be talking about with these people are things that the Republican Congress has blocked, and he can only do a limited amount by exec order.\xc2\xa0 So how much of this is about placing some of these economic issues at Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 feet before the elections?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is still the view of the President that we\xe2\x80\x99re several months away from the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 So the President right now is focused on governing, and he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on making clear where his priorities are.\xc2\xa0 And there is an opportunity for him to make the case to the American public that there are commonsense things that Democrats and Republicans should be able to work together on in Washington, D.C., that would be in the best interest of middle-class families in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, is this going to be a subject of some discussion in the elections?\xc2\xa0 Yes, it probably will.\xc2\xa0 The elections are fundamentally about choices.\xc2\xa0 And there does seem to be a pretty stark difference between Republicans in Congress who don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to really want to do anything, and Democrats who want to work with the President to put in place some commonsense policies that would be good for our economy and good for middle-class families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut there will be a time and a place for that.\xc2\xa0 That said, the President also is committed to doing what he can to support Democrats in the upcoming elections.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing today is speaking at a fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest to you that the President has somehow walled himself off from the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s an election in five months.\xc2\xa0 But he also is committed to working in bipartisan fashion to make progress where we can.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been rebuffed repeatedly by Republicans as we\xe2\x80\x99ve sought to find common ground on some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 But the President is determined to make progress, and that means continuing to try to find opportunities to work with Republicans, but also continuing to work on his own where necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a foreign policy question.\xc2\xa0 To go back to the G7 in Brussels last month -- the President and the rest of the G7 leaders said that they would give Putin about a month to meet the conditions that were set in G7 -- withdrawing from the border, not supplying the separatists, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 So a month would be up about next week.\xc2\xa0 Is there a hard deadline to this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no hard deadline that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to set from here.\xc2\xa0 There are some other asks, if you will, that were made of President Putin at that time.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that it was the judgment of the international community that President Putin should recognize the legitimacy of the Ukrainian election that brought President Poroshenko into the presidency.\xc2\xa0 President Putin has done that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen some movement along the border in a positive direction.\xc2\xa0 Now, unfortunately, in the past couple of days we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some movement at the border that isn\xe2\x80\x99t so positive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does appear that there might be some, yes.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about and watching pretty closely.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along -- or at least as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said over the course of the last week -- there have been some encouraging comments from President Putin.\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99re mostly focused on are the actions.\xc2\xa0 And it is those actions that are taken by the Russians that will determine whether or not additional sanctions are required to convince the Russians that they should use their influence in the region to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds a little bit like this \xe2\x80\x9cdeadline\xe2\x80\x9d is sort of elastic.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there are any hard deadlines set.\xc2\xa0 I know that there were -- that there is a meeting in Brussels of European leaders, I think that begins later on this evening, where I know that this will be a topic of some discussion.</p>\n<p>Again, the United States is committed to acting in close concert with our international partners, particularly our allies in Western Europe, to address this situation.\xc2\xa0 And there have already been steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken over the spring and early part of this summer that have isolated the Russian regime for their behavior as it relates to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to consult with our allies about whether additional steps are required to further isolate the Russians, to further pressure them to use their influence to help de-escalate the tension in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry this morning called on Russia to make those changes that you talked about within hours.\xc2\xa0 Is that a signal that the trigger point on these issues is today or tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that is an indication that we\'re watching the steps that are taken by the Russians very carefully.\xc2\xa0 And what we would like to see are steps that he takes right away to de-escalate the situation and ensure that weapons and materiel is not being passed from the Russian side of the border into the hands of separatists in eastern Ukraine. There are some concrete steps that Russia can take, and we are watching in a nearly real-time basis to see whether or not those steps are being taken.\xc2\xa0 And there is more that President Putin needs to do, and if he fails to take those kinds of steps, additional sanctions that would be levied in a coordinated fashion with the United States and our allies remains a possibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not unilateral sanctions, in other words?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to take anything off the table from here.\xc2\xa0 We are serious about making sure that Russia feels the appropriate amount of pressure to take the kinds of constructive steps that we want them to take.\xc2\xa0 So any kind of sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s imposed will be more effective if it is one that is closely coordinated with our allies.\xc2\xa0 Those are the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken thus far, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve had an effect.\xc2\xa0 And the likelihood of additional steps is increased -- or additional sanctions is increased if Russia continues to refuse to take the kinds of actions that will de-escalate the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On today\xe2\x80\x99s event, how often has the President responded to these letters personally to the people who write these letters?\xc2\xa0 If he responded before, how often has he responded?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s definitely responded before.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for the President to respond to some of those letters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In what way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just back up.\xc2\xa0 The President on a regular basis receives about 10 letters a night from the correspondence department.\xc2\xa0 These are letters that represent the cross-section of communications that have been received by the White House, be it by fax or by --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 E-mail?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- through the Postal Service or even through e-mail.\xc2\xa0 And it is an opportunity for the President to get a sense of what kind of reaction he\xe2\x80\x99s getting from citizens all across the country, either to world events or to political decisions that are made.\xc2\xa0 And so this is one way --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is he responding, though?\xc2\xa0 Has he called people?\xc2\xa0 Has he met with them before?\xc2\xa0 Has he handwritten them back?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s done all of those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give me a --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done all of those things.\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just a couple of weeks ago the President went to the restaurant owned by someone who had written him a letter in Alexandria, who was talking about the economy and asked the President to come visit their restaurant.\xc2\xa0 So that was one way that the President responded to a letter.\xc2\xa0 The most common way that the President responds is through a handwritten letter of his own.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He does?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I think some of these handwritten letters have made their way to the public sphere, and you guys have written about them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of meeting with this women, Rebekah, the President\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings for whatever reasons are in the lower -- in general sense, are lower than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been the general tenure that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You guys are following those more closely than we are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, but is this part of the idea that the White House believes that the President could have a little bit more common touch through these kind of events and sort of have people sort of better understand him again, or what?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that part of it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think that\'s part of it.\xc2\xa0 I think part of the -- I think most of this is about using this as an opportunity to convey very clearly to you and -- through you to the country about where the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities lie.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s top domestic priority is expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And he received a pretty eloquent letter from a working mom from Saint Anthony, Minnesota, talking about some of these issues.</p>\n<p>So responding to her letter in person is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me say one other thing, which is the fact of the matter is the President also enjoys the opportunity to get outside of the grounds of the White House, to get outside of Washington, D.C., and spend some time talking to average working folks across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the message that he understands -- that it was a message that the President understands that what\xe2\x80\x99s most important to people not getting through to now?\xc2\xa0 Is that why you need -- he needs to do some of this?\xc2\xa0 Is that somehow because --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s getting through, because I think if you look at -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at these polls more closely than I have.\xc2\xa0 But I think those polls indicate that at least a plurality, if not a majority of Americans, recognize that the President really is fighting for middle-class families out there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This really is an opportunity to demonstrate that.\xc2\xa0 And rather than talking about that just inside Washington, D.C. -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s value to that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s also value to getting outside of Washington, D.C., and spending some time having lunch with a working mom from Minnesota, or hosting a town hall meeting where you hear directly from citizens in this community talking about some of the issues that are most important to them, and hopefully hearing from them about how they\xe2\x80\x99re benefitting from some of the policies that the President is fighting to implement.</p>\n<p>So that\'s really the goal.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President to have a more robust sort of two-way communication.\xc2\xa0 So rather than somebody sending a letter and the President sending a letter back, he can actually shake hands with a business owner, or talk over lunch with a working mom about some of the challenges that her family is facing.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s really the goal.\xc2\xa0 The President, frankly, would do this a lot more often if he were able to.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, over the course of the summer at least, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the woman that the President has made time with today, Rebekah, as of yesterday afternoon described herself in her Twitter profile as \xe2\x80\x9ca badass.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 By yesterday evening, that descriptor had been removed from her Twitter profile.\xc2\xa0 Did the White House ask Rebekah to tone down her Twitter profile?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But as somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s recently updated their Twitter profile, maybe I need to spice it up a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be a little more specific about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do with Rebekah today, other than you said lunch?\xc2\xa0 But are there other events?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some aspects of the schedule that for some logistical and security reasons we\'re not going to announce in advance.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do our best to keep you apprised of the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities as he goes through the day.\xc2\xa0 But when we land, the President is going to have lunch with Rebekah.\xc2\xa0 It should be a good opportunity to have a casual lunch and talk to her about her letter.\xc2\xa0 From there, the President will participate in a town hall meeting in the neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re looking forward to hearing from a pretty good cross-section of that community about some of these issues that the President is really focused on in Washington.\xc2\xa0 So the President is looking forward to that.</p>\n<p>Then, again, the President will -- may have the opportunity to make another stop or two in the community that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more updates on.</p>\n<p>And then, tomorrow, the President is going to give a speech where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about some of the policies that he thinks would benefit middle-class families across the country.\xc2\xa0 And when he gives that speech he\xe2\x80\x99ll be introduced by Rebekah at that event.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not as much a \xe2\x80\x9cday in the life\xe2\x80\x9d as like a \xe2\x80\x9ccouple of hours in the life\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It will be an opportunity for the President to get a good sense about what Rebekah\xe2\x80\x99s typical day is like and to talk about some of the issues that she confronts in a typical day.\xc2\xa0 And I think Rebekah, herself, is probably pretty excited about spending at least a portion of a day in the life of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about how the White House prepared Rebekah for the day?\xc2\xa0 Have people been here for days getting her ready, or have they told her what restaurant to go to and what to do in the afternoon?\xc2\xa0 Or is she really on her own?\xc2\xa0 Is she just going to go about and do whatever she wants to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had a number of conversations with Rebekah about coordinating the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to make sure that she shows up at the right place at the right time.\xc2\xa0 But our goal here is not to stage-manage something.\xc2\xa0 Our goal here is to give the President an authentic opportunity to see at least part of the world through the eyes of this one working mom in Minnesota.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s an opportunity that, as President, that when he\xe2\x80\x99s inside the gates of the White House or behind the heavy doors of the Beast in the limo, that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get to see.\xc2\xa0 And this is a different perspective, and the President is really looking forward to this opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we\xe2\x80\x99d be ruining it if we were trying to stage-manage this whole thing.</p>\n<p>So what we are trying to do is put together an opportunity for the President to really see at least part of a typical day in Rebekah\xe2\x80\x99s life through her eyes.\xc2\xa0 And this is an opportunity that the President is really looking forward to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did you pick the people who are coming to the town hall?\xc2\xa0 Are they all selected?\xc2\xa0 How did you pick that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I will get you some more information about how the crowd for this town hall meeting was determined.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President watching TV?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think he was planning to when I walked up here.\xc2\xa0 So I do expect -- as I think I mentioned yesterday, many times when people get on an airplane they are at risk of missing a significant television event like a World Cup match involving the U.S. men\xe2\x80\x99s soccer team.\xc2\xa0 When you\'re the President of the United States, it actually gives you a better opportunity than you would otherwise have to actually spend some time in front of the television watching the game.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m confident that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take advantage of that opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he isn\xe2\x80\x99t as you left him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as I left him, but I think I walked up here before the game had actually started.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you let us know, just to verify it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick one on Minneapolis.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced some pretty serious flooding.\xc2\xa0 Is the President building in any time to go in and assess that?\xc2\xa0 And when the governor asks him to declare a federal emergency, will he agree to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that earlier today before we left the White House the President did get a briefing from his Homeland Security team about how these communities are dealing with what is a pretty serious flooding situation here in Minnesota.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that state and local officials, as they ordinarily would in a situation like this, have the lead for responding.\xc2\xa0 But they also are coordinating closely with FEMA officials who are here on the ground, trying to provide needed federal support.\xc2\xa0 I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s actually going well, and that coordination will continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would anticipate that the President will have an opportunity to visit with Governor Dayton today.\xc2\xa0 And if he does, I\'m confident the President will be eager to get an update to hear how things are going and to hear from Governor Dayton directly.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Governor spent a lot of time -- a lot of his own personal time over the last couple of days monitoring the response, as he should.\xc2\xa0 So the President will want to hear about what Governor Dayton has seen, and the President is going to actually want to hear that Governor Dayton is getting the kind of cooperation and support that he can and should expect from the Obama administration as communities across Minnesota deal with this flooding.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you if there are any concerns that are raised, the President will be acting on it today.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know how that goes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a Lisa Monaco briefing?\xc2\xa0 Or do you know --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly from whom the President received the update, but I know he was interested in getting a detailed update about what was happening here before he left, and I\'m told that that occurred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as far as his meeting with Dayton, you anticipate, but as far as touring the flood zone or anything?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t expect anything like that.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, I wouldn\'t expect a formal meeting with the Governor, but I do think that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to have a robust conversation about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one question about the Ex-Im Bank.\xc2\xa0 You talked earlier about how the President is always looking for compromises on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 And there is a compromise proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s being floated for the Ex-Im Bank that would lower the lending cap by a third and impose some restrictions on lending to foreign- and state-owned companies.\xc2\xa0 It is a compromise being sought to keep the Ex-Im Bank running and authorized.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering whether the White House is looking at it.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House open to compromise on the Ex-Im Bank?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is the first I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing of that compromise.\xc2\xa0 I do know that senior administration officials have been in touch with our counterparts on Capitol Hill to try to work through this.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to be able to -- to give you a reaction to that compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 But stay in touch with our folks.\xc2\xa0 And if get into a position where we can offer a reaction, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All right?\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see you on the ground, guys.\xc2\xa0 Should be fun.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:19 P.M.
