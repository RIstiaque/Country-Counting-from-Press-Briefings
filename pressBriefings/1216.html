Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for an answer to a question (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.</p>\n<p>\n\t*The President\xe2\x80\x99s speech today was at the invitation of the US Chamber of Commerce.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:26 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on Egypt and then I want to ask you something about the Chamber speech.\xc2\xa0 The President said as he was walking back that Egypt has to negotiate a path and I think they\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate a bit on his thinking, where specifically do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re making progress?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Ben, what the President was referring to is that, as you heard him say on Friday, that we have the beginnings of a process that is taking place, a process that we know has to include a series of steps that have to be taken and a series of things that have to be negotiated with a broad section of the opposition parties in order to move us towards a free and fair election.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that we will -- meaning the world and I think most importantly, the Egyptian people -- will evaluate where we are in terms of the steps that are being taken in order to see the words that are spoken about meaningful change actually result in some concrete actions.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what people are looking for.\xc2\xa0 Words are not enough.\xc2\xa0 It is actions toward a meaningful change that the Egyptian people are most looking for.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This thing, as you know, has changed by the hour.\xc2\xa0 So the President as we stand today is optimistic about how the process is headed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- optimistic, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important in a couple things, because I think what you just said is very important, that this thing does change very quickly, hour by hour.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understand if you take half a step back what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen over the course of 10 to 14 days.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me describe it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some monumental changes in Egypt:\xc2\xa0 a leader say he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to run for reelection; a leader say that his son won\xe2\x80\x99t be running in his place for election; the appointment of a Vice President and the tasking of that Vice President to lead a process to result in a free and fair election -- many other points along the way.\xc2\xa0 But I think that is important.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, the most important thing is that there has to be a process toward meaningful change, that we have to see, again, the government sit with a broad cross-section of society that makes up -- when I say the opposition, people that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in government -- to get us toward the free and fair elections that we know ultimately will be a result of this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely from the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday as they relate to the Muslim Brother -- whether in that broad spectrum you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about he is comfortable with that group being part of the conversation, in fact, whether he sanctions them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, those that will be involved in the discussions about what happens next in Egypt, as we have said throughout many occasions, will not be determined by us.\xc2\xa0 I also think if you look at what has happened, again, over the last 10 to 14 days, I think the notion that somehow all of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as the result of one political faction or one set of beliefs is not at all the case.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of elements throughout Egyptian society not represented in its current government, seeking the rights that we\xe2\x80\x99ve enumerated in here that they have sought that want to be part of this discussion.\xc2\xa0 And quite frankly, we strongly support democracy in Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me say this.\xc2\xa0 But democracy is -- again, I said probably more than a week ago -- democracy is not one group hijacking a process so that they can take power from another group that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t think fairly represented their views and their rights.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not democracy.\xc2\xa0 Democracy has to be a broad section of people that are represented in what would be a free and fair election.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason I asked, in particular --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- one more interruption -- and I think it is very important to restate as we have said many times, we will be a partner to a government that does exactly what I describe and we would expect that that partner would uphold particularly the treaties and the obligations that the government of Egypt and ultimately the people of Egypt have entered into.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking in particular about the Muslim Brotherhood because in his answer yesterday the President acknowledged -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact wording, but there\xe2\x80\x99s an anti-American strain --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to some of their thinking.\xc2\xa0 So the American people might look at that and say, well, where does this President stand if that group is going to be involved?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean -- look, again, who is involved in the larger process is up to the Egyptians to determine, understanding, again, that the only -- I think it would be horribly inaccurate to simply say that there are two factions in Egypt -- one is the Muslim Brotherhood and the other is the government of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not the case and clearly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case in what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen transpire on the streets.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But obviously, as the President said, the anti-American rhetoric and the anti -- the rhetoric that goes very counter to the very regional peace and stability that I spoke of is of course not something that is supported by the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to squeeze in a quick one here about the Chamber. In his speech the President said to the Chamber leaders, ask yourselves what you can do to hire American workers, to support the American economy, to invest in this nation.\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- I understand the broad point about shared responsibility, but why does he think he would need to say to them, ask yourselves what you can do to hire workers.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he think they\xe2\x80\x99re already doing that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we are -- look, I think it is clear we are coming out of a period that we have not seen in our country\xe2\x80\x99s history in probably the 80 or 90 years -- the economic collapse that we saw, the jobs that were lost as a result of it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, what the President wants to see and wants to have a continued discussion on are ways that we can foster ideas for innovation, for building, for education, that continue to give business confidence in the strengthening of our economy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make decisions.\xc2\xa0 And we want to do what we can to help them make decisions to hire folks here in this country because they feel like the economy is getting stronger and coming back.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Robert, what is the U.S. assessment of how badly the protests in Egypt are hurting its economy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there\'s -- without getting into the assessments that we may discuss in private, I think you can see there\'s a lot of reporting about concern about food and fuel prices inside of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And as we talked about last week, we were concerned, and there have been several meetings on how we help get commodities that are either close or at the edge of at entryways or in ports into the cities where they\xe2\x80\x99re needed most. Obviously we are concerned about capital that might leave and obviously we continue to monitor to see whether -- what impact some of these -- all of these actions might ultimately have on the global economic recovery.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- at least the last time I had a longer discussion about this, we did not see impediments in the Suez and things like that that would result in big fluctuations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean so far the assessment on the global economy is not a major concern to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that -- obviously we continue to monitor important things like the Suez.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in here, Egypt is not an oil exporter.\xc2\xa0 But I think this is -- needless to say, this is something -- whenever you have a crisis in a country with the magnitude of this, its impact on the global economy is watched quite closely here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And while you are weighing, at least, or threatening on one hand, to look at your aid policy towards Egypt based on how they respond to the protesters, are you also looking at potential financial help to help the country because of this impact?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, again, we have had discussions about ways to assist the movement of goods and services, commodities, throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President has discussed on a lot of his conversations with other world leaders about the situation not just what the United States but what other countries can do that are closer in the region to help the process of business and commerce.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ve got banks that are opening back up again and such.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on the Chamber if I may.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people from the Chamber were hoping or expecting that the President today would outline some kind of a specific way forward for the Panama and Colombia trade pacts.\xc2\xa0 Why did he not do that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, be patient.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all I would say.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think, look -- and let me expand on that a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we picked up an agreement with South Korea that had not made any progress.\xc2\xa0 We spent a lot of time working on that agreement to ensure that all of the stakeholders felt like it represented the best interests of this country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We walked away from what would have been a nice PR hit in Seoul because we didn\'t think the agreement did what it needed to do for us -- only to come back and get an agreement that we thought was even better, which then got stakeholders from the left and the right, liberals and conservatives, business and labor to support the agreement that we did come up with.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that is a model for moving forward on other trade pacts like Colombia and Panama.\xc2\xa0 And as for that, I\xe2\x80\x99d stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that model have a timetable?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d like to move forward and those are discussions that are beginning.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Issa has solicited suggestions from industry about regulations they feel are impeding job growth, per the President\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago. Has the President pinpointed any regulations he feels like can be changed immediately or in the short term so as to help with job growth?\xc2\xa0 And has the White House reviewed any of these regulations that industry is asking you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there\'s an update on what our op-ed was a couple weeks ago, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check.\xc2\xa0 The President -- and I think he mentioned it again today -- a review process that goes through and looks at outdated or unnecessary regulations.\xc2\xa0 At the same time we have to balance that with, as the President said today, sensible standards to ensure safe and clean drinking water, and safe and clean -- the safety and cleanliness of the air that we breathe, in order to create, again, some sensible standards for -- to protect our families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let me see if there\'s an update on what the President wrote about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 A couple of weeks ago, Axelrod told me in an interview that the President had been confronting -- that\'s the word he used -- Mubarak directly on human rights and political reforms.\xc2\xa0 That was the strongest word you guys have used to date to describe those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Usually it was just done in a readout that said that the issue was raised.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate a little bit more on how confrontational the President has been with Mubarak?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance on NSC.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is a topic on human rights, on democracy, on freedom of assembly that the President has had on a number of occasions with President Mubarak.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s brought up in virtually every bilateral meeting that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware that our country has had with, at any level with the Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you saw a pretty clear statement about elections that were held last year and a pretty clear statement in opposition to -- our opposition to their decision to continue emergency law, one of the things that has to be looked at in the process of negotiations that\'s going forward now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, I don\'t know that I\'d ever get, Jake, into reading out with some specificity the tone or what have you, but I can assure you, as those readouts have said that you guys have gone back into your emails to look at, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear with President Mubarak and the Egyptians about what we needed to have happen.\xc2\xa0 And that is true not just of this administration but many of these arguments have been made for many years by other administrations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But bringing it up with just words is one thing.\xc2\xa0 You guys, since this crisis began, have dangled out the prospect of reviewing aid to Egypt depending on how the government deals with this crisis.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an action, to threaten to withhold aid if certain steps are not taken.\xc2\xa0 Was that done in previous --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final thing.\xc2\xa0 Apparently the Google executive Wael Ghonim has been freed.\xc2\xa0 Google sent out an announcement.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if you guys had any response to that or if you guys were involved in that in any way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC on whether or not we were involved in that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President Mubarak president in name only?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems as if the United States is behind the Vice President as leading this transition process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Vice President has been tasked by the President to lead this transition process.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about a process, Dan.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about a series of personalities.\xc2\xa0 This is about ensuring that we have meaningful actions through negotiations between the government and the opposition that lead us to free and fair elections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do think, again, as I said earlier to Ben, stepping back and understanding we have a Vice President for the first time in almost three decades of President Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in Egypt. He tasked Vice President Suleiman with the process of working through these changes.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was clear when the President said yesterday that Egypt has let the world know they\xe2\x80\x99re not going back.\xc2\xa0 And our policy is obviously to move Egypt forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how does the White House then view him as --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 View?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Mubarak -- is he still the leader of Egypt, the go-to person for the administration?\xc2\xa0 Or are you dealing mainly with the Vice President at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say I don\'t -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been apprised of any leadership changes in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, President Mubarak has resigned I think on Saturday his leadership position -- as his son did -- in party politics.\xc2\xa0 Dan, we have conversations with a whole host of players throughout the Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the leadership of Egypt is not going to be determined by us; it will be determined by the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 And what the Egyptian people want to see most is a meaningful process that brings about these changes.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to be the judge of whether this process is moving at a pace that\'s required, and we want to see that process move forward.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President, again, not just say yesterday but say on Friday, the transition has to begin now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question about the Muslim Brotherhood, I know you keep insisting that this is something for the Egyptian people to figure out, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for the United States to interfere.\xc2\xa0 But would the White House be comfortable with the Muslim Brotherhood playing a significant role?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, obviously, as I said, we have significant disagreements with -- we have not been in contact with the Muslim Brotherhood.\xc2\xa0 But Dan, we don\'t -- the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pick leaders of other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about picking them, but would you be comfortable if they became -- took on a leadership role?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have said in other countries in the world that becoming part of -- you have responsibilities if you become part of the government to adhere to the agreements that that government has laid out, to adhere to the rule of law and to the constitution, and to adhere to non-violence.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we have many disagreements with the rhetoric of some of the leaders in that organization.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, on Sarah Palin.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to the remarks that she made about Egypt being the President\xe2\x80\x99s 3:00 a.m. call that went to an answering machine?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to tell you, I read that answer several times, and I still don\'t really know what she said.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on the reports over the weekend and more today about Mubarak possibly going to Germany for --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not aware of discussions going on about that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing to report on that, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell -- what is the President doing in terms of calls?\xc2\xa0 Is he still making calls?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think believe the President has made any calls today.\xc2\xa0 I think Tommy read out the latest calls from over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 There obviously was another -- a fairly standard meeting this morning at the deputies committee, and this obviously was a huge chunk of the daily briefing that the President got this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you -- from the administration\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, what exactly is the role of Suleiman and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The role of Suleiman is -- as I said to Dan, he is the individual tasked with the government\xe2\x80\x99s part of a process toward meaningful change.\xc2\xa0 And that change -- the change that ultimately leads to a recognition of rights, a renouncement of the emergency law, and the emergence of free and fair elections.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, this is about a process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about a personality.\xc2\xa0 And it is important that the people see progress toward that meaningful change, just as it is important that those in the opposition take part in this process and put forward what they want to see come out of this, so that there is a meaningful discussion and meaningful negotiations about what Egypt is going to look like going forward.\xc2\xa0 Because as the President said, it is clear Egypt is not going back to what it was.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s interview before the Super Bowl, did the President have any feelings about it afterwards?\xc2\xa0 Did he express any --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think he was eager to get to the -- I think he was eager to watch the game.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about you?\xc2\xa0 What do you think about the interview?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was also eager to watch the game.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House received a readout of precisely which opposition groups have met with the Egyptian Vice President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously we get some update on who is involved in the process.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I want to be clear, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to determine who should and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be involved in that process.\xc2\xa0 For the process to be a legitimate process, it has to include a broad cross-section of those that are in Egyptian society, in Egyptian civil society, and not involved in that government.\xc2\xa0 And there are -- this is a process that is going to be at times bumpy because when for 28 years you have had one leader without a series of -- without really a robust opposition, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time to work this stuff out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think what is important is that process -- as the President has said, the process has to begin now, the process has to move forward, and the people in Egypt will know whether that process is moving forward at the pace that they need it to move forward, and whether or not the concerns that have brought them to Tahrir Square are being addressed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the world is watching.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys feel like you have an accurate way of assessing what the average Egyptian believes or wants at this point?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen obviously certain people who are anti-the government take to the streets.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some people perhaps on the government payroll on the other side of the street.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what the average Egyptian who is going about his or her day -- do you guys feel like you have a way of assessing what they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that one of the things that the embassy -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this -- one of the things that the embassy is tasked with and does well in Egypt is to have conversations with a broad cross-section of people in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 People -- and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just potential -- or people that are just focused on government.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s business, there\xe2\x80\x99s cultural, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole cross-section of people that are important for us to communicate with, and those are primarily done, and done fairly routinely, out of the embassies that we have around the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think our ambassador there is doing a remarkable job.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Chamber, real fast.\xc2\xa0 On efforts to lower the corporate tax rate, the upper tax rate from, I guess, 35 to 28, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how far along in the process are you guys at this point.\xc2\xa0 Is everything still on the table, being considered?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously you want it to be deficit neutral, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think this is -- I think, Mike, what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that this has to be an open process that is one that -- and I think you heard the President discuss it clearly today, that those involved in this structure, in this system, take part in.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as a result of some meetings that we had at the Blair House, discussions that Secretary Geithner and others have had -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of this process and hearing from stakeholders about their ideas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know tactics are changing all the time.\xc2\xa0 What is our policy toward Egypt right now?\xc2\xa0 How would you describe our policy toward Egypt?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our policy toward Egypt is we watch and we are strongly encouraging the process of meaningful change transpiring, resulting in a more open, a more transparent society, a more responsive government; one that the United States can continue to partner with; one that results in -- a process that results in free and fair elections, and one that is democratically elected.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Egypt is not an ally, or not as good of an ally as it has been, is that a policy failure?\xc2\xa0 Or is the goal to just try to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I think that is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it makes a lot of sense to get into electoral hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 Our focus is twofold:\xc2\xa0 One, to continue to speak out against the violence.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see more and more of this.\xc2\xa0 I know you all are probably more aware of this than -- because these are your colleagues that are coming back who have -- who we saw were targeted and beaten last week.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, those types of actions can\xe2\x80\x99t continue.\xc2\xa0 Violence cannot be the response from this government to the cares and concerns of its people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our energy right now is focused on doing what we can to encourage this process of change along.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be bumpy. It is going to be -- it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be determined by the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Mubarak growing increasingly -- do you guys get the sense that Mubarak himself is becoming increasingly isolated inside his own government?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t honestly have anything for you on that, Chuck.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said definitively there\xe2\x80\x99s been no American government contact with the Muslim Brotherhood.\xc2\xa0 Last week you sort of left it open that we were reaching out to a broad section.\xc2\xa0 So last week we reached out to everybody except the Muslim Brotherhood?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I was describing was some of what I was talking about earlier, which is we have fairly regular and robust discussions with a lot of different people in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Again, the last time I was -- I talked about this we had not had conversations with them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out, that there would be some outreach and some embassy --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility, as I said earlier, for those that want to have responsibility in governing that they have to do several things.\xc2\xa0 And democracy is a commitment to something larger than themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who did the President call last night after the Super Bowl?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think he\xe2\x80\x99s called anybody yet.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to call some folks this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t called Aaron Rodgers?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that is scheduled for a little later this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Lockerbie, Robert?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As a Packer fan I know that there --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is killing me.\xc2\xa0 He has bias toward the Rooneys -- that\'s pretty clear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- look, Ambassador Rooney is a good friend.\xc2\xa0 It was a good game.\xc2\xa0 I think everyone -- I think the President -- look, the President was hoping for a meaningful process that resulted in -- (laughter) -- his Bears being in the Super Bowl.\xc2\xa0 Now that we don\'t have that, you want a good game.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, Robert, there was a release of 150 documents in Great Britain on the al-Megrahi-Lockerbie case, showing that contrary to prior statements by the Labor government, the Labor government may indeed have developed a policy behind the scenes to do all they could to ensure the release of the Lockerbie bomber.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, all I\'ll say on this is I think our position throughout this process was public and very clear.\xc2\xa0 We did not think in any way, shape or form that his release was in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching gears here, a week from today the President is going to be releasing his budget.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s gone for in the last couple of years haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone through -- things like cutting farm subsidies.\xc2\xa0 But now you have a new crop of Republicans --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No pun intended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even -- anyway -- who might be looking -- who might be more amenable to some of these things.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find out --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Try and see if I\'ll read out that particular line of the Ag budget that, as you appropriately mentioned, might be released sort of in a week?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is there any outreach that would go on before the budget release to members of Congress, especially new members of Congress, to try and make sure that some of these proposals actually have life this year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me see -- we can check and see if there was anything -- obviously the budget gets -- the process of putting together a budget starts -- has been going on for many, many months.\xc2\xa0 So I think obviously this is -- look, the introduction of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, as you saw in Jack Lew\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President discuss, will contain some very significant and some very tough decisions -- significant cuts and some tough decisions, resulting in the five-year non-security discretionary freeze, about $400 billion in cuts, and will result in our government spending the smallest share as a percentage of GDP going back to the Eisenhower administration.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some significant cuts.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is this is a -- this will be an ongoing process and an ongoing discussion that will be had over the course of many months.\xc2\xa0 The President is anxious to hear from Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We understand we have to make some serious changes in our fiscal policies going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that mean that the five-year freeze is what we should be looking for as far as tough decisions, or is there -- will he say anything beyond that regarding --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, I do appreciate how everybody puts out ideas and then they\xe2\x80\x99re quickly cast aside.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a $400 billion 10-year idea that takes us to the smallest share of government spending as a product of our GDP since Dwight D. Eisenhower was roaming these halls.\xc2\xa0 So I think just to throw that off as, well, so do we already know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll get some more specifics, but obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s the top line of what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was Jennifer Lopez sufficiently interested in the game last night?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think a good time was had by all -- (laughter) -- unless you were a Steelers fan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did the White House solicit an invitation from the Chamber to address them today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact process.\xc2\xa0 I think they invited us, but I can double-check on that.*</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Egypt, does President Obama see any merit in what Frank Wisner said over the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear that, as I think many of us told you, former Ambassador Wisner is not an employee of the government.\xc2\xa0 He was, based on his broad experience in Egypt, asked by the State Department -- and I would direct you to the State Department on the specifics of anything regarding him -- to travel to Cairo and have a specific conversation with President Mubarak.\xc2\xa0 He did, and reported that back to us.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut his views on who should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the head of Egypt don\'t represent the views of our administration.\xc2\xa0 The views of our administration are that those are decisions that will be made by Egyptians.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that specifically, Robert?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you aware that he works for Patton, Boggs, which represents the Egyptian government and the Egyptian military?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would direct you to my friends at the State Department who brought this recommendation to us.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that also --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sheryl, I don\'t know that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to add much to the fact that you should --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, a little bit of a different twist, that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- talk to our friends at the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There has been considerable criticism of the Obama administration and the President for sending him, in light of Patton, Boggs\xe2\x80\x99 ties, business interests in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering do you think --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, let me -- let me --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask the question, and then you can say you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to answer it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m almost sure I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say so I\xe2\x80\x99m just shortening the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, don\'t shorten it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m shortening the great experience that you and I are having today.\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the State Department selected him based on his experience with Egyptian policy.\xc2\xa0 Again, the specifics of what you just said and what you were just about to say, I would reiterate for the third time that there are many good people over at the State Department that have answers to those questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my question is, in the future, do you think you might consider these kinds of business interests more seriously before sending such an envoy?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem or a conflict in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Please call the State Department, Sheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- Mr. Biden has called Mr. Suleiman twice now.\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to say that Biden has the Suleiman brief?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a counterpart-to-counterpart, Vice President-to-Vice President call relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any calls from President Obama to Vice President Suleiman in --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one final call question.\xc2\xa0 Did the President call or hear or know of Jane Harman\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think some people may have known that she was interested in that position, but I don\'t know that -- I can check with OLA and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMara.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just the question on the Chamber speech and then Egypt.\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the $400 billion over 10 years, that\'s net after he\xe2\x80\x99s made the investments he wants to make and paid for them?\xc2\xa0 Is that correct -- the $400 billion is net?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- we all understand we have to cut spending.\xc2\xa0 And as you freeze the level of spending over the course of five years at a certain level, you\xe2\x80\x99re still spending X amount of money.\xc2\xa0 So inside of that money, you can cut some and add to others.\xc2\xa0 But the baseline is a freeze.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but in terms of cutting some and adding to others, he said he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make room for the new investments he wants and they\'re all going to be paid for.\xc2\xa0 Will the budget on Monday explain how much all of these are going to cost and how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay for them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we have and we continue to reiterate that the process must include a broad cross-section of those in Egyptian society and representing the viewpoints of that group of people.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that -- it is clear as we watch what transpired over the course of many days that this was not a series of protests organized by one group.\xc2\xa0 They were the cares and concerns of a lot of different people in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And democracy, which we\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of in Egypt, has to include that broad cross-section.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not just two factions in Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s one really organized one and then a bunch of other ones who turned out to protest.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you, how you can --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been any contact with Vice President Suleiman today, Sheryl.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anybody to call the Vice President of Egypt to know that our government and many past administrations have believed strongly that the emergency law needed to be lifted.\xc2\xa0 It is quite clear that what we have had in Egypt for three decades is not what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have in Egypt moving forward.\xc2\xa0 So the notion that Egypt isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready for democracy I think runs quite counter to what we see happening in Tahrir Square and on the streets on cities throughout the country of Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is incumbent upon the government to play a meaningful role and to encourage a meaningful process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that statements like that are not going to be met with any agreement by the people of Egypt because they don\xe2\x80\x99t address the very legitimate grievances that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen expressed as a result of these protests.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can sort of look at this as a follow-up, actually. You\xe2\x80\x99ve said a couple of times that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of personalities, it\xe2\x80\x99s process.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t the point that a lot of the demonstrators are making that it is personalities and that whatever process begins cannot be legitimate if Hosni Mubarak is still in power and pulling the strings?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you taking sides against some of the demonstrators?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because I think, quite frankly, Mark, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we want to see this process move forward.\xc2\xa0 We understand that there are a whole host of things that those that seek recognition of human rights, legitimate rights want to see. We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the government and the people discuss constitutional changes that they need or would like to see before we get to free and fair elections, and they\xe2\x80\x99re important.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we can\xe2\x80\x99t see meaningful progress if one side is as -- where Vice President Suleiman\xe2\x80\x99s remarks are today, and the other side is, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do anything until everything changes.\xc2\xa0 The process has to be dynamic and we have to see the government take part in a meaningful way and outline a series of steps and a timeline that the Egyptian people are comfortable with.\xc2\xa0 And we have to see those that are not involved in government put forward a set and a series of ideas of what they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see, so that negotiations can take place and we can move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest to have two sides be so far apart and the process be stopped.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s a process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the leaders -- who picks the leaders of Egypt, that\'s going to be determined by the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 That is not -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re not saying -- I want to be clear, this government does not come down on the side of, one way or the other, who those leaders are.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a process for the Egyptians.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By saying that you don\'t really -- that you\xe2\x80\x99re indifferent to the personalities, it\xe2\x80\x99s the process involved, are you not taking sides against many of the demonstrators who said the process needs to begin with Mubarak leaving?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, because I think I was pretty clear about what the government just said as being unacceptable, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, I guess the point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make, Mark, is that if one side says we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to change at all, and one side says we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to participate until everything changes, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to simply have -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a very static situation.\xc2\xa0 And I think what is important is that we have to have and see meaningful progress, and both sides have to be involved in that progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow on two very important things you said?\xc2\xa0 You said before there was no economic impact.\xc2\xa0 What about the sabotage --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I want to be -- we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring the economic impact.\xc2\xa0 We have -- I think we have not seen impact in the Suez in particular.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the sabotage of the gas pipeline in Jordan?\xc2\xa0 Do you know --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we continue to monitor and get updates on what that is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you said that President Obama had resigned his leadership.\xc2\xa0 Has he technically?\xc2\xa0 I thought he was --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak with him directly about it.\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He had a lot of applause lines in there and they sat on their hands.\xc2\xa0 There was total silence when he talked about such things as regulation, moderate applause when he said he\xe2\x80\x99d go anywhere in the world to talk about exporting U.S. goods.\xc2\xa0 Does he think he got his message across?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ann, the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t go there so that everyone would clap when he came in the room.\xc2\xa0 I think he went there to -- and you go and deliver these speeches because, I think as the President said in the very beginning, we have a lot of work that we have to do together, and the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make progress is if we work together on a whole host of issues in a very challenging global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President is clear that we are not going to agree on everything.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of that transpire over the past two years.\xc2\xa0 But as the President has said, we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking to refight the battles of the past two years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got significant challenges that continue to lay ahead of us and the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make progress is to tackle those challenges together.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take the President\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure proposal as a way of outbuilding our worldwide competition.\xc2\xa0 To watch that endorsed by the head of the Chamber and the head of the AFL-CIO is exactly the type of bringing people together that I think the President believes has to happen in order for us to break out of the boxes of Washington and make some real progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions on the health care ruling, the most recent health care ruling.\xc2\xa0 One, does the administration believe that the penalty for not carrying insurance, is that considered a tax justified by the general welfare clause or the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered this in many past briefings and I\'d point you to those answers.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One more on that.\xc2\xa0 Judge Vinson said that a injunction is not necessary -- a quote from that decision -- because longstanding presumption is that the official -- is that the official of the executive branch will adhere to the laws as declared by the court.\xc2\xa0 In this case, is the administration adhering to the law?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are many courts that have heard many cases on this.\xc2\xa0 Twelve have dismissed the case.\xc2\xa0 Two have -- more than 12, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, have dismissed this case.\xc2\xa0 Two have ruled in our favor as to its constitutionality.\xc2\xa0 Two have ruled against us.\xc2\xa0 Implementation of the health care bill rightly continues to move forward, as it\xe2\x80\x99s the law of the land.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but the other decisions didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak so much to the totality of the law, even Judge Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, they ruled on its constitutionality.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I\'d point to you even places -- I think you saw just late last week the state of Wisconsin, despite the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the lawsuit, the state of Wisconsin announced that the implementation moves forward.\xc2\xa0 And I would point out that one of the statehouses in the Commonwealth of Virginia passed by a vote, I think, of 95-3 to begin setting up health care exchanges.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s pretty clear indications that the implementation of this important law move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow quickly on that?\xc2\xa0 Has the administration been in touch with any of the Republican governors who are questioning whether resources should be devoted to implementation to insist or assure them that they should continue with plans?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that we have had specific outreach. I know the Governors Association is in town later this month.\xc2\xa0 But our policy has and continues to be that implementation moves forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on Sudan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just another question about the Chamber speech.\xc2\xa0 One of the times that the President went off of his remarks a little bit was to say that retirement spending is dragging on the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is this -- I know you guys have mentioned Social Security as a way of reinforcing the system, but is this something that the President wants to address to deal with the long-term deficit?\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to lead that sooner rather than later?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, I think as the President mentioned in the State of the Union, that unless we deal with all of our budget, there\'s not enough -- we don\'t spend enough in discretionary spending to solve the problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, Lester, you\xe2\x80\x99re awfully excited today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So unless or until we deal with -- and look, I think the steps that the President took in health care clearly have an impact on the long-term deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the CBO said repealing health care would cost more than $200 billion in the next 10 years, and certainly cost more in the 10 years after that, because you\xe2\x80\x99re changing the arc of health care costs and health care spending.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think there\'s no doubt that this has to be a process that\'s dealt with.\xc2\xa0 But it also has to be a process that everybody is involved in.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to see big changes around that unless all the stakeholders across different -- across the political spectrum are involved.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Robert, just two -- just two questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
