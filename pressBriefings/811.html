EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being with us, and welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to the great state of New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements at the top of this gaggle, but perhaps my colleague does.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Two very quick things.\xc2\xa0 Early voting starts in North Carolina today, which we\'re very excited about.\xc2\xa0 In New Hampshire, just so you know, you can register to vote up until the day of the election.\xc2\xa0 So that will be a focus of ours, encouraging people to go register.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And also today, after the President\xe2\x80\x99s event, the New Hampshire team will be kicking off -- I just want to get the title right -- \xe2\x80\x9cAround The Clock for Barack: the 24-Hour Tour for the Middle Class.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re kicking off with a phone bank, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be making 15 stops in all 10 counties on an RV over the course of the evening.\xc2\xa0 So if anyone wants to stay and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get on the plane, I\'m happy to put in a good word for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not called \xe2\x80\x9cBarack Around the Clock\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, that\xe2\x80\x99s a suggestion, but they called it \xe2\x80\x9cAround the Clock for Barack.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It has a nice ring to it, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk about the Washington Post story this morning where the President says that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to veto a fiscal cliff legislation that does not include a tax increase for those making more than $250,000?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing new in that story.\xc2\xa0 The President has long made clear he will veto an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent of Americans, wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That has been his position, as you know, for a very long time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If there is concern about what we can do right now to address the so-called fiscal cliff, the House ought to follow the Senate and pass the extension of tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people -- for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that would substantially address some of the fiscal cliff, and that would provide reassurance to middle-class Americans that their taxes will not go up, and it is the right and responsible thing to do.</p>\n<p>So again, the story this morning contained nothing new as I read it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So win or lose the election he will veto anything that does not include a tax cut?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate.\xc2\xa0 First of all, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to lose the election.\xc2\xa0 Second of all, the issue here is clear:\xc2\xa0 We cannot afford tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons why we have the fiscal situation that we have is because the previous administration twice passed massive tax cuts largely benefiting the wealthiest Americans and did not pay for them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how, in part, this country saw its fiscal situation go from one of surpluses as far as the eye could see when George W. Bush took office to record surpluses [deficits] when George W. Bush left office and President Obama was sworn in.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just fiscally irresponsible and it does not help the economy.</p>\n<p>As you know, economists agree that tax cuts for middle-class Americans are very effective in not just helping those families, but promoting economic growth; tax cuts for the wealthiest does not.\xc2\xa0 So we cannot afford it.\xc2\xa0 It is not the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position has not changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is he confident, though, that he can get this done during the lame duck?\xc2\xa0 Or can there be this -- does there have to be an accommodation in order to fix it down the road?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As enticing as the proposition is to negotiate the many economic issues that will be worked out after the election, today, I\'m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 But the President is confident, we remain confident that we can address these issues.\xc2\xa0 There is near consensus about the need to take a balanced approach, to deal with our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 There is unanimity in Washington about the need to extend tax cuts for 98 percent of America\xe2\x80\x99s wage earners and salary earners.\xc2\xa0 And we ought to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If Republicans and Democrats agree that 98 percent of the American people should have their tax cuts extended, well, that\'s great news; let\xe2\x80\x99s pass it, sign it into law.\xc2\xa0 That\'s good for the economy, good for those families, and would address right away some of the concerns about the fiscal cliff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President remains --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President does remain confident that we can and we will resolve these issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it true that he hasn\'t met with Republican leaders in Congress since the summer?\xc2\xa0 And shouldn\'t he be meeting with them to sort this thing out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward very clear plans for how to address our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 The President supported and urges the House to support the bill that the Senate passed that extends tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And again, that would address some of these concerns about the fiscal cliff.</p>\n<p>There is one obstacle -- which all of you know, because you\'ve reported on it -- to achieving a significant deficit reduction in a way that continues to invest in the economy, in education and research and innovation, infrastructure, and other areas so that our economy grows, that protects 98 percent of the American people from having their taxes go up.</p>\n<p>That approach, as I said, has -- enjoys a broad consensus in Washington and around the country.\xc2\xa0 But one obstacle to that has been the adamant refusal by Republicans, especially in the House, to accept the principle that there should be balance, that as part of a broad deficit reduction plan, we need to include not just spending cuts, not just entitlement reforms, but more revenue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has said in many of his stump speeches that it\xe2\x80\x99s not that we were out of ideas, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a political stalemate that\xe2\x80\x99s been keeping things from getting done.\xc2\xa0 And so he\xe2\x80\x99s asked the electorate to break the stalemate.\xc2\xa0 I know you said you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to lose the election, but if for some reason there was a different outcome, wouldn\'t that also send a different message to the President that a different approach is needed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, I\'m not going to speculate about an outcome to the election.\xc2\xa0 You know my view, and that is that the President will win reelection.\xc2\xa0 And he said on a number of occasions that he is confident that since the electorate will have spoken on this issue and will have endorsed the broad consensus that we need to take a balanced approach to these matters, that that will compel Congress to move in that direction.\xc2\xa0 And that will help us resolve some of these issues that have been tied up in a stalemate.</p>\n<p>As I also said, we should recognize and acknowledge, as the President has, that some of these disagreements will have to be resolved by the electorate, and that\'s the disagreement over whether or not we need to give more tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 The American people will decide that in this election.</p>\n<p>But there is agreement that unless there are any millionaires and billionaires in this room, that everybody here and middle-class families across the country, 98 percent of American earners, should have their tax cuts extended.\xc2\xa0 Republicans say they\'re for that.\xc2\xa0 Democrats are for it.\xc2\xa0 The President is for it.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s do that right now and then address the things that we disagree over after the election.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there any contingency planning to have Treasury retain the current withholding rates so that you do have time to work this out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we are confident that this will be worked out.\xc2\xa0 I certainly am not going to talk about, like, Treasury contingency plans.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 But as I just said, the President is confident that we will resolve these issues.\xc2\xa0 There is broad consensus that we need to do so in a balanced way and in a way that ensures that middle-class Americans do not have their taxes go up, but that millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, initial jobless claims are up fairly significantly today.\xc2\xa0 How much concern is there that the economy may be losing any momentum that it did have?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a broad array of positive economic data lately, including housing starts yesterday.\xc2\xa0 On the jobless claims, what we say every time a weekly report comes out, or a monthly report comes out, is that we do not overreact one way or the other to any single piece of data.\xc2\xa0 We look at trends.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the four-week trend, when it comes to jobless claims, is the one that economists look at.\xc2\xa0 And the four-week trend that includes this week\xe2\x80\x99s jobless report or unemployment claims report demonstrates that we are 13,000 lower than we were the previous four months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That shows what Alan Krueger, the Chairman of the CEA, and other economists have said, and that is that we\xe2\x80\x99re making steady progress.\xc2\xa0 The economy is healing and continuing to create jobs and grow, but we have much more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President, going to the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans that include not just extending tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, but the elements of the American Jobs Act -- which outside economists all agree would put a million people back to work if Republicans in Congress were to pass it -- that\xe2\x80\x99s another measure that we can take to help this economy grow and to help it continue to create jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, the President rattled off some of the positive economic stats yesterday, and I know you all have an ad.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a bigger part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in the days to come, touting some of the signals that the economy is mending?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks every day are a combination of steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, how well many of these steps have worked not only to bring the economy back from the brink of collapse, but to provide health care to millions of Americans, to help small businesses on Main Streets across the country, help more kids go to college.\xc2\xa0 But also, part of that is explaining to the American people some of the good signs we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned a couple of those signs for the past couple of weeks since we received the last jobs numbers.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the first one to say, as he says every day, there\xe2\x80\x99s more we need to do; we\xe2\x80\x99ve come too far to come back.\xc2\xa0 There are some good signs we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the stakes are so high, and why his plans to move the country forward are what he talks about also in his remarks and are much better for the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us when the President was informed that he could have been a target of this guy who is suspected of wanting to blow the Federal Reserve in New York?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into details of his security briefings.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that he was briefed on the specific matter.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I have to refer you to the FBI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say how long ago he was briefed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into timelines, but he was of course briefed on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have any reaction to the arrest?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He obviously is pleased by a successful law enforcement operation, but beyond that, obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter for the FBI and the courts, the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have either of you seen the Smith speech tonight?\xc2\xa0 How funny is he going to be?\xc2\xa0 And how much will he focus on himself versus his rival tonight?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, stay tuned.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get too ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0 I will say Mitt Romney has practiced for longer than any presidential candidate in history for tonight, and we expect him to be drop-on-the-floor funny.\xc2\xa0 And the President will make his way through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did see Plouffe and Favreau were laughing as they got off the helicopter.\xc2\xa0 Were they probably talking over the President\'s speech?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I will say the President attended, as you know -- and I think most of you know -- this event four years ago.\xc2\xa0 He enjoyed himself.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a long tradition with the Al Smith Dinner of bringing the candidates together, breaking bread, having a few laughs in the midst of a close race and a heated campaign.\xc2\xa0 And so he\'s looking forward to doing that this evening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize his relationship at the moment with the Archbishop of New York?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\'s been some tensions, although he did speak at the Democratic Convention.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know the President appreciated his participation at the convention.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had a conversation with him about it beyond that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to -- and I read remarks this morning that he made about how he\'s happy to sit down and have a meal with people he even has small disagreements with.\xc2\xa0 And there are many areas where they do see eye to eye, and there are some where they have disagreements, including contraception.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve both been very forward about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But obviously, they extend the invitation to the President for the second time and he\'s happy to be here -- or happy to be going later this evening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, they have a Bruce Springsteen concert.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be able to watch that in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to divert the plane.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be watching sports instead?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) He\'s talked about, like -- I mean, Springsteen said he was going to sit out the election and not be political.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have to twist his arm, or how did that come about?\xc2\xa0 If you could talk a little bit about that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think he was pretty clear in his endorsement that he\'s a strong supporter of President Obama, that he\'s happy to be out there rallying people in Ohio and Wisconsin [Iowa] and participating in the effort to get people engaged, this key part in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 We\'re thrilled of course that he\'s out there.\xc2\xa0 Who\'s better than Bruce Springsteen to get young people and people who are not young anymore excited.\xc2\xa0 And I think it will be a great event with President Clinton today.</p>\n<p>And the great thing for us strategically is that we have President Obama in New Hampshire today, laying out the choice, laying out for people of the state why the election is so important.\xc2\xa0 But we also have a great event that will be well attended and covered in Ohio today.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many are you expecting?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I never get ahead of crowd counts, but it should be a good crowd.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think Springsteen will outdraw the President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think that more American people have seen Bruce Springsteen over the years than have seen President Obama, and that\'s a pretty big feat, because the President has had some pretty big crowds.\xc2\xa0 But Bruce Springsteen has had a pretty significant career, and we think he\'ll draw a good crowd today in Ohio.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just want to note for the record that when Jen referred to the not-so-young people who are fans of Springsteen, she was looking at Nakamura, not me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, has Bruce Springsteen been practicing longer for tonight than the President has been practicing for tonight?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think Bruce Springsteen needs a lot of practice.\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s got his shtick down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report that there\'s been a rhetorical shift in the President no longer saying that al Qaeda is on the run.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that is intentional?\xc2\xa0 Or is that a reflection of what the President believes to be the case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked this question yesterday, and what I can tell you is that this President, when he came into office, made clear his intention of refocusing our efforts on those who attacked the United States of America and killed Americans on September 11th, 2001.\xc2\xa0 And he has kept that promise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our efforts against al Qaeda have inarguably led to success and progress, but the work is not done.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda central has --and a leadership there has been devastated by our efforts and the efforts of our allies.\xc2\xa0 But al Qaeda remains our number-one enemy and our number-one foe.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we focus so much of our attention on al Qaeda and its affiliates, because the struggle against al Qaeda continues, and the President has been focused on it since the day he took office.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:55 A.M.
