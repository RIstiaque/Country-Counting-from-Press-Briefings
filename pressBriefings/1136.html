EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, so I\'ll start with questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s take is on this House Republican vote tonight on rejecting a debt limit increase unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Does he think that this vote is a matter of substantive policy, or is this gamesmanship?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, as you know, agrees with members of both parties in Congress that we need to do something serious about deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 That is why, among many other measures that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken, he asked the Vice President to lead the negotiations that Vice President is leading towards that end.\xc2\xa0 And those negotiations have made progress, in our view, and we remain confident that there will be an agreement that will significantly reduce the deficit and answer the mail, if you will, with regard to those concerns that the President and members of both parties share.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also believe quite strongly that we have to raise the debt ceiling -- there is no option to doing that -- and that that will happen, because the economic impacts of not voting to raise the debt ceiling would be calamitous.\xc2\xa0 Both will happen, we believe, and both are happening concurrently and, in many ways, on parallel tracks.\xc2\xa0 So the President looks forward to an agreement on deficit reduction and to the Congress doing what it must do, which is vote to raise the debt ceiling that so that we, as the United States of America, continue to honor our obligations and pay our debts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But given all that, what is his reaction to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the House side tonight, and what kind of tone does he think it sets for this meeting --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President is aware that members of Congress have in various ways, including this one, expressed their opinion that there needs to be significant deficit reduction, and many have expressed an opinion that it needs to be linked to -- rather, the vote to raise the debt ceiling needs to be linked to significant debt reduction and deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We have said and continue to say that we believe both are important priorities and both can proceed concurrently at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So as we make progress on these talks that the Vice President is leading at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, we believe that an agreement is possible and we hope likely.\xc2\xa0 And we also believe that regardless of any other development the debt ceiling must be and will be raised.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he thinks that -- ultimately the President thinks he will get enough Republican votes to raise the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes,\xc2\xa0 Yes, definitely.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic quickly.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai, as you know, has come out angrily about the NATO strikes and has said that he will no longer allow NATO air strikes on houses there because of the civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 I know NATO has continued to express regret about how some of these have gone.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, A, does the White House think that the Afghan President can declare that?\xc2\xa0 And B, is that something the United States would support?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as has been expressed, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, by ISAF and others, we regret greatly the loss of life and especially any civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as you know, over the past year, this administration, working with the -- the military has taken extraordinary steps to reduce the loss of innocent life in our operations undertaken by both ISAF forces and Afghan forces in coordination.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to do everything we can to reduce civilian casualties, working with President Karzai, working with Afghan forces, as we continue this important mission.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can he make that call, no more NATO air strikes?\xc2\xa0 Or is that a NATO --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we work in coordination with the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 We are making sure that we have coordinated efforts with Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- we do not operate in a vacuum in that country, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with President Karzai on this important issue because we take very seriously his concerns, and we share them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you just said that it would be calamitous not to raise the debt limit.\xc2\xa0 When the President meets with Republicans tomorrow, does he have a new message for them, especially those that are skeptical that it really would be calamitous about why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to do that?\xc2\xa0 And what does he think about the skepticism that\'s been raised by some Republicans that this is really as serious as the administration has been suggesting it is?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would point the skeptics to comments by leaders in the business community, by experts from all over the economic field.\xc2\xa0 I think the evidence that there would be calamitous results to a failure to raise the debt ceiling is fairly compelling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would point them also to President Ronald Reagan, who wrote then-Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker in 1983, he said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe full consequences of a default, or even the serious prospect of default by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate.\xc2\xa0 Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and on the value of the dollar in exchange markets.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is Ronald Reagan writing to the Senate Majority Leader asking him to make sure that the debt ceiling is raised in 1983: \xe2\x80\x9cThe risks\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- find that letter?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s available as part of the historical record.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe risks, the costs, the disruptions and the incalculable damage lead me to but one conclusion:\xc2\xa0 The Senate must pass this legislation before the Congress adjourns.\xe2\x80\x9d -- November 16th, 1983.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with Ronald Reagan and many others that we cannot default on the full faith and credit --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- get that letter?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can, yes -- full faith and credit of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the point the President wants to make tomorrow when he meets with the Republican conference?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he will.\xc2\xa0 But he also, as he did with the Senate Republicans, will want to hear and listen to their ideas, their concerns.\xc2\xa0 And part of the process here that he thinks is very important is that Washington -- that Americans, rather, expect their elected leaders here in Washington to come together and work out solutions to these challenges that we face, rather than talk past each other -- solely talk past each other on television and in other forums -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s useful to come together in the same room, talk and listen.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he looks forward to doing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be any press coverage of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s closed press -- I mean, in part because we need it to be and he wants it to be an open and frank exchange, and not the kind of thing that leads to -- we get every day in Washington where one side goes up on TV and says something, another side goes up on TV shortly thereafter and says something else, and there\xe2\x80\x99s not a real conversation.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to listening, as he did with the Senate Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this morning information from the Case-Shiller home price index made it official that the value of residential real estate have reached a new low point.\xc2\xa0 Since the great recession began, home prices dropped by 5.1 percent, a level not seen since mid 2002.\xc2\xa0 A decade worth of home prices just vanished.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any response to this news?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that can be done?\xc2\xa0 You weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the White House at the time, but the President announced a housing plan to great fanfare that he said would help, I believe, 3 to 4 million people, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite reached that level. What is the response?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s step back.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we obviously are aware of these numbers and we understand that this is a challenge.\xc2\xa0 The housing market remains in a challenging situation.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to remember more broadly that we have begun effectively a recovery, an economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had -- we\'ve seen quite solid job growth now for many months, and three-quarters of a million private sector jobs were created over the past three months alone.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Restoring health in the housing market after its dramatic collapse was never going to be easy.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve taken a lot of measures, some of which you\xe2\x80\x99ve just mentioned, to mitigate the impact of that, especially on foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 And we are working aggressively to help homeowners modify their loans to avoid going into foreclosure, and investing in communities hardest hit by the continued difficulties in the market -- in fact, the hardest hit communities program, or hardest hit states\xe2\x80\x99 program is just really getting up and running now, so we hope that will have a positive impact.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question this is a -- the domestic housing market was hit very hard by this worst recession since the Great Depression and it remains a challenge that we\'re addressing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The HAMP program may be -- obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a tough competition, but it might be the most controversial piece of legislation that the President has put forward in terms of its effectiveness.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are other pieces of legislation that people might dispute that claim with, but the President said it would help, I believe, around 3 million people, and the last I checked it was under 1 million who have received permanent home modifications.\xc2\xa0 Is there any plan for the administration to try again, try something new, try something more effective?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are implementing the foreclosure mitigation programs that we\'ve already gotten in place, and over 600,000 homeowners have obtained permanent modifications to their mortgages under HAMP.\xc2\xa0 On average, over the past six months, 25,000 to 30,000 more homeowners are obtaining permanent modifications each month.\xc2\xa0 And so far nearly 1.5 million families have received HAMP trial modifications.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that falls short of the President\xe2\x80\x99s goals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And more work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing implementation of the program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And look, one of the things that will help the housing market would be -- is continued economic growth and continued job creation, because, clearly, people with jobs, people with solid incomes, a growing economy, all of those things will help improve the housing market in the long term.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work on this every day.\xc2\xa0 This is the focus this President has, and is why he -- going back to Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question about the commerce sector -- I mean, one of the reasons why he picked John Bryson is because he feels that he understands and will be able to help the economic team focus on doing things that will continue job growth, continue economic growth, increase our competitiveness, increase our exports, all with the big goal there, which is job growth -- job creation and economic growth for the long term in this very competitive economic environment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to the Senate Republicans, as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Bryson, renewing their threat to hold up his confirmation until the free trade agreements are put forward?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President, obviously, has done a lot of work to ensure that these free trade agreements have been put together and come to pass.\xc2\xa0 There are still technical discussions going on with the administration that always precede bringing them up in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 We also want and believe that we should have an agreement from Congress to extend TAA, Trade Assistance Authority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we think that it would be folly to hold up a nomination so important as the Commerce Secretary for any reason.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to Senate confirmation not just of John Bryson, but of his deputy, who was put forward last month, and working with Congress to get these trade agreements passed, which the President very much wants to have passed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the administration reviews its Afghan strategy, how will the costs of the war impact in the strategy going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think if you go back and review the record for when the President developed through an exhaustive process the policy that he has now been implementing on Afghanistan, the issue of -- he didn\'t ask for a bill for how much it would cost. He wanted a policy that would -- had the best chance of succeeding, at achieving our goals, which were very clearly defined, which is to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda and to ensure that Afghanistan would not again become a haven for terrorists, and to take the steps necessary to make that come true.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That remains -- what the President has been doing since then is implementing this policy, obviously with his military and the rest of the administration.\xc2\xa0 Part of that policy was to begin a drawdown in July 2011.\xc2\xa0 That will happen as the policy dictates. Another fact that he has discussed going back to the campaign is that we have to make sure that everything we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is done with a mind to the costs and effectiveness.\xc2\xa0 And I think that applies to military endeavors, national security endeavors, as well as domestic endeavors -- domestic economic endeavors, for example.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the strategic goal here is disrupt, dismantle, defeat al Qaeda and ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a haven for terrorists.\xc2\xa0 That remains the priority -- those remain the priorities of the President as he makes a decision about the pace, the size and slope of the drawdown.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So cost won\xe2\x80\x99t be the major factor, but it would be a consideration?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have enormous resources in this country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the wealthiest country in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have the greatest, most effective military in history.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously live in a world of limited resources.\xc2\xa0 Even if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the recession that we had, we are not without limit in terms of the resources that we can tap in order to fund anything that we want to fund as a government.\xc2\xa0 So we have to make choices.\xc2\xa0 But again, the priority the President set remains the priority:\xc2\xa0 Disrupt, dismantle, defeat al Qaeda; ensure that Afghanistan does not become a haven for terrorists as it was in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you give this optimistic tone that there will be an agreement on raising the debt ceiling, what is that based on?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I said is there will be an agreement on deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We remain optimistic about that.\xc2\xa0 What that is based on is how we view the progress that the talks have made.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the debt ceiling, we also believe, as members and leaders of Congress of both parties have said, that it has to be raised because the effect of defaulting on our obligations as the United States of America would be calamitous to the domestic economy and to the global economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that would mean -- that would hurt growth.\xc2\xa0 It could reverse the recovery, potentially.\xc2\xa0 It could definitely have an impact on growth and definitely have an impact on job creation.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that anyone in Congress would think that that was a good idea, ultimately.\xc2\xa0 We understand the concern because we share it, that we need to reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working so hard with members of Congress to reach an agreement on that.\xc2\xa0 We also agree with the statements by numerous leaders of Congress that we have to raise the debt ceiling, and we believe that Congress will do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one quick question on Sarah Palin.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is watching all the attention she\xe2\x80\x99s getting and what he thinks about this whole flirtation with a candidacy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Having spent a lot of time with him over the past several days, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s paying much attention to that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously had his hands full with a lot of other things that he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t really comment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to housing prices, Jay, consumer confidence is another key component in terms of an economic recovery, and that seemed to take a hit of about 6 points between April and May.\xc2\xa0 Any new thoughts from you on consumer confidence and what could be done to restore that confidence?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we are working very hard on a number of fronts to continue to make the right choices and the right decisions, working with Congress to continue the recovery to enhance job creation and economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And I cited earlier the positive numbers that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had recently, in terms of growth and jobs and most importantly private sector job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no question that we have seen some temporary impacts in the data from disruptions stemming, for example, from the crisis in Japan and other temporary factors.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the impact that higher gas prices has had and energy prices have had has been felt by families and businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we remain optimistic about -- as private economists say, as well, that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to see economic growth; that we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 Most independent forecasters continue to project solid growth for the second half of this year.\xc2\xa0 We agree with that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our administration\xe2\x80\x99s predictions.\xc2\xa0 And I would note simply that the private sector has created more than 2 million jobs over the past 14 months, and nothing is more important than keeping that going.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Commerce nominee, Darrell Issa, who\xe2\x80\x99s from California, says about Mr. Bryson that he\xe2\x80\x99s a founder of an organization that opposes efforts to increase domestic oil production, and questions whether that\'s the guy you want as a key advocate for our economic interests.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that the President sets policy and the President had made very clear that he wants to increase domestic oil production and has taken measures to do that in a safe and responsible way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the fact is, is that John Bryson has an enormous variety of experience in business, with non-profits like NRDC and in government.\xc2\xa0 He is uniquely qualified, the President believes, to be a member of his economic team to serve effectively as Commerce Secretary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, considering all of these signs that the economic recovery is fragile, at best, is the President concerned that all of the discussions going on right now with the Vice President seem about cutting spending, and that this --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said constantly he doesn\'t want to cut spending if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to hurt the economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 But is there any way around it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just make sure -- to clarify that he has said we need to reduce spending, but we need to do it in a responsible way, and we need to protect our investments in those areas that directly affect our economic growth and job creation\xc2\xa0 -- investment in innovation, in education, in infrastructure, the things that will drive job creation and economic growth in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So you bet that in his discussions with the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations, directed by the President, with the members of Congress, we are very insistent that we protect those investments that we believe go right to the heart of the matter here, which is to continue economic growth and continue job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he -- if it looks like that this thing is heading off in the wrong direction all of a sudden?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, he believes -- in terms of overall?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we need to reduce spending.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s taken measures already to reduce spending, both in the budget deal that he reached to fill out the fiscal year 2011 with Congress; with his passage of the Affordable Care Act, which as you know is a significant deficit reducer, both in the near term and the long term; and he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to that because he believes that getting our fiscal house in order is important to our economic growth and to our job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You have to do it in a balanced way and you have to be mindful that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take steps that reverse the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 That goes to raising the debt ceiling and it goes to some of the -- one of the reasons why the President opposes the Republican budget, House Republican budget, because he believes that it would have a negative impact on seniors and others, and have an overall negative impact on the potential for growth in the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House pleased that there\xe2\x80\x99s a clean vote on the debt ceiling happening today?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is something you guys called for a month ago.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that.\xc2\xa0 Look, we are pleased by the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making in the negotiations led by the Vice President on deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We understand and we share the concerns that members of Congress have about the need to reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 And a number of members have said we have to do -- one has to be linked to the other.\xc2\xa0 We believe they should not be linked because there is no alternative that\xe2\x80\x99s acceptable to raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 But we are committed to reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have moved so aggressively and seriously with these negotiations, why we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the fact that they have produced positive results so far --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what about today\xe2\x80\x99s vote?\xc2\xa0 Is it a useful exercise?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys can decide whether it\xe2\x80\x99s useful.\xc2\xa0 I think that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you tell us -- I mean, is it useful to you guys?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a quick -- any comment -- charges are being filed against KSM today and four others down in Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 The military -- any comment?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t on that, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your new Commerce nominee has an extensive amount of experience in energy.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to view him as part of his energy team as well as part of his business outreach and\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be separate to begin with, because, as you know -- energy is a major issue in general, economically.\xc2\xa0 Clean energy and development of energy alternatives is, he believes, vital to the economic health of this country in the future.\xc2\xa0 And he thinks that John Bryson will contribute to that discussion internally within the administration very heavily.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I don\'t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a separation here between -- Secretary Chu is in many ways a member of our economic team, too, because of his expertise and because of the importance of the energy sector to our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But normally a Commerce Secretary wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be involved with energy policy or environmental policy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, given his particular background on that, is he somebody who the President would rely on for expertise in specific energy and environmental issues?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he certainly thinks that he\xe2\x80\x99s an exceptional candidate given the diversity of his experience and that his -- that diversity will allow him to bring to bear his knowledge and experience into discussions that the President has on all aspects of economic policy, including energy policy and environmental policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in particular in his background that makes him a good person to promote exports, since that\'s such a big part of what Commerce does and such a big emphasis for the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- again, look at the diversity of his experience.\xc2\xa0 You have -- he served on the board at Boeing.\xc2\xa0 He served on -- he serves on the board at Disney.\xc2\xa0 These are obviously companies that do a lot of international business.\xc2\xa0 I think that his -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not just where he was CEO or where he has direct business experience as an executive, but also his understanding of the intersection between government and business, which is very useful given his experience in government.\xc2\xa0 And then obviously throwing in his work with nonprofits, it\xe2\x80\x99s really an impressive package.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what drove the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally on this subject -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot said and you\xe2\x80\x99re well aware that there\xe2\x80\x99s been tension between the White House and the business community over the opening couple of years of the administration.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that bringing somebody in who\xe2\x80\x99s so steeped in business will help -- among other moves, will help the White House with its relationship with business?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President casts, as he does routinely in filling these kinds of positions, casts a wide net, wanted of the best possible candidate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s John Bryson.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the nominee he picked.\xc2\xa0 I think that the experience he brings is useful and will be useful in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 And the business experience is valuable, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question about it.\xc2\xa0 But so, too, is his experience in government and his experience in the nonprofit sector, and his intimate understanding of clean energy development and industries.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the things he worked on since he left Edison was electric cars, as well as solar energy.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- these are all elements of a resume that the President feels very compelling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So should the business community feel good about the fact that they have one of their own, sort of, in the room?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I think the business community I hope will feel good about the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s an enormously qualified candidate to be Commerce Secretary.\xc2\xa0 He will represent the United States abroad very well as we work to double our exports over five years -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal.\xc2\xa0 And he will I think be able to work effectively not just with the business community but a variety of communities to contribute to the economic debate here, the economic discussion, and the goal that we all share of increasing growth and increasing job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 If President Karzai says no more bombing of private homes, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the final decision on the subject?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I, first of all, am not going to get into discussion about missions and what they do and don\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our civilian and military leadership in Afghanistan is in regular contact and consultation with the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 And we take President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s statements seriously and we take his concerns about civilian casualties very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And we will work with him as we have throughout this process to take the measures that we can to reduce civilian casualties.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he says, no more.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s his country, a sovereign nation.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s President of it.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to accommodate him.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not standing here with President Karzai to work out an agreement.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we are regularly in conversation with him and with his government, with the security forces there, about our mission there.\xc2\xa0 We have taken I think serious steps to reduce civilian casualties and have done that, and that has been effective.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to consider this a high priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last question:\xc2\xa0 On Germany, any reaction from President Obama on Angela Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s 180 on nuclear power, getting her country out of the nuclear power generating business?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 I would say that we have a system here that we have a lot of faith in, that our independent regulatory body ensures that we have the safest and most responsibly run nuclear energy industry in the world, and the President remains committed to nuclear energy as part of his clean energy agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the past few years, White House officials have consistently, the President on down, have reached out to members of corporate America, CEOs, to sort of pick their brain on economic issues.\xc2\xa0 With Bryson, I think he was in here in January of \xe2\x80\x9909, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not one of the CEOs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen here for summits or other events.\xc2\xa0 What kind of communication has he had with the President over the last few years and other White House officials?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any details for you on conversations he may or may not have had with anybody here in the building prior to his nomination.\xc2\xa0 I think, obviously as part of this process those conversations took place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would say that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of speculation about who this nominee would be, and one of the reasons why a lot of that speculation was off is because it\xe2\x80\x99s very important for the President, to enable him to make the right decision, that this process not be a completely public one.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s an enormously qualified individual.\xc2\xa0 The President has a lot of faith in his capacity to do this job well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have a pre-established relationship?\xc2\xa0 Is he --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any knowledge or information about that.\xc2\xa0 We -- he was part of a process that produced what the President thinks is the best candidate for the job.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the vote tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming you\xe2\x80\x99ll put out a statement after it, or will you have anybody --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t even know if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to respond at all.\xc2\xa0 Okay, my question about this is you said it was fine.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You got to get the whole --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yes, I get all the atmospherics. But so do you think that this vote has -- it sounds like you think that this vote has nothing to do with the calamity that you have predicted would happen if the debt ceiling was breached.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We think that the debt ceiling will be raised.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think this vote has nothing to do with stopping the debt ceiling --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that it is an expression of a point of view that obviously we have heard numerous times leading up to this vote, and it reflects concerns that we have, which is that we need to address our deficits and debts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a political statement?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, everything that happens in Washington is political by nature.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is -- these are elected politicians and elected leaders.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t mean that in a pejorative sense.\xc2\xa0 I just mean that we understand the views that are being expressed.\xc2\xa0 We share the concerns that drive those views.\xc2\xa0 In the end, the debt ceiling has to be raised.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe very strongly that the impact of not raising the debt ceiling would be calamitous, that defaulting on the full faith and credit of the United States is a very bad idea.\xc2\xa0 We disagree heatedly with any who suggest otherwise.\xc2\xa0 We can cite a long list of validators of our position on this that go back to at least Ronald Reagan in 1983 and probably predate President Reagan.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s our position and we believe that, in the end, Congress will do the right thing and vote to raise the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that the markets understand that?\xc2\xa0 That this vote has nothing to do with --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on the markets, but we believe that Congress will act and act in time to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because one of the things that members of the administration and others have been saying is that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t like the government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t go to the final hour.\xc2\xa0 If the markets think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to default, they could start reacting in a way that would really hurt us way before August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think that this will spook them in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without commenting on -- I don\'t want to predict a reaction to something specifically in the markets, but we do believe that it is important that action be taken in a timely manner so that the global economy and the global markets do not anticipate a default, because the anticipation of a default would have very negative consequences, just as a default would.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you don\'t think that the vote against the debt ceiling raising --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on this particular vote and the impact it may or may not have on the markets.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe that Congress will vote to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And members and leaders of Congress have said they will vote to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is just an exercise, it sounds like.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered that question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackie.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just one quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The Republican leaders in the House apparently felt the need, before scheduling this vote or after they scheduled it, to privately call and meet with financial executives and reassure them that this was not a real vote, let\xe2\x80\x99s say.\xc2\xa0 Did the administration, did Treasury Secretary Geithner, anyone in the administration similarly have any private communications with market people about how the markets might react, given the fragility of the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you should address that question to the Treasury Department, but not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any -- did the administration express any concern to the Republican leaders that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best time to be holding a vote like this?\xc2\xa0 Or the right --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, specifically with regard to this vote, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 We have obviously expressed our concern about the folly of suggesting that we don\'t need to raise the debt ceiling and the harm that would be caused if there were a perception created that Congress would not eventually raise the debt ceiling in time.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know of any communications specifically related to this vote.\xc2\xa0 And that may be in part because we were all traveling last week, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say -- on Bryson, can you say anything about how his name came into the mix and whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s a close acquaintance or friend of Bill Daley, given that they were both on the Boeing board?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about any relationship -- I mean, obviously the Chief of Staff played a big role in the search for this nominee, because he\xe2\x80\x99s the Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 He also happens to be a former Commerce Secretary himself.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the extent of their relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether he threw the name into the mix?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what do you think of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s amnesty for all political prisoners?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that so I can\xe2\x80\x99t react.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, a journalist for Andrew Breitbart\xe2\x80\x99s Big sites says that a University of Arizona source told him that the slogan for the January memorial in Tucson, Together We Thrive, came from conference calls with the White House in internal meetings.\xc2\xa0 But in January the White House said they had no involvement at all with the tee-shirts.\xc2\xa0 Do you stand by that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know about the report you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get me something on that later if I email you?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s something -- but, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my second question, based on his -- what he said and his actions, I think a reasonable person can conclude that President Obama believes in the right of gay couples to marry.\xc2\xa0 So why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he come out and said that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has said in the past what his position is.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 And if it changes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll let you all know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last time we checked, he said it was evolving.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I have no update for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With this withdrawal or drawdown of troops in Afghanistan next month in July, are we moving towards what might be called the Biden plan where we have -- we move away from sort of a counterinsurgency strategy, the nation-building strategy, and more towards a counterterrorism strategy where we have a smaller footprint and are less worried about sort of building up Afghanistan as a nation than countering terrorism where and how we can?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward with is the Obama plan, and that is the strategy that the President put into place after the review, the policy review, and it continues to be the strategy.\xc2\xa0 And it has never been one or the other.\xc2\xa0 It has always been a comprehensive plan aimed at disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become a haven for terrorists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Part of that plan was, from the beginning, to begin a drawdown in July of 2011.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that we are almost upon that date and the President will, as promised, begin the drawdown on that date does not reflect a change in plan.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it reflects consistency.\xc2\xa0 It reflects implementation of the decision he made when he announced the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, earlier this month Senator Tom Harkin endorsed the President issuing an executive order mandating that the federal government only contract with companies that have non-discrimination policies for their gay and transgender workers.\xc2\xa0 Harkin joins Senator Jeff Merkley and Colorado Congressman Jared Polis who also said they welcome this -- from the President. In the wake of these endorsements, is there any consideration at all in the administration to issuing this directive?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything new for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President take heed when someone like Tom Harkin, who helped the President out early on during his White House bid in 2008, does the President take heed when Tom Harkin calls on the President to issue such an order like that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the President always wants to hear what Senator Harkin has to say on a variety of issues, but I don\'t have anything for you on that particular one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I am going to ask you about a prediction.\xc2\xa0 As the Vice President is leading his budget reduction meetings and all the numbers are crunching, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing them come out with large files, stacks of papers in their arms, their number-crunching efforts going on.\xc2\xa0 When will the dust settle?\xc2\xa0 What is the prediction for when the dust will settle or when the -- after the job cuts, and when will the American pocketbook will see relief after all these budget cuts?\xc2\xa0 And even if you want to throw in the raising the debt ceiling, you can.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean, when will --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will the middle-income pocketbooks see relief after all the dust has settled or after all the budget cuts with the deficit reduction, all the measures the government --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you mean, when will the job be finished, in terms of full recovery of the economy --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about when people will be able to breathe again financially.\xc2\xa0 When they will --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that is the job, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is the job.\xc2\xa0 But when do you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And this is what the President is focused on every day.\xc2\xa0 And primary beneficiaries of the relief provided in the Recovery Act, of the tax cut deal that the President made with Republicans at the end of last year, has been the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And he continues to focus on -- as he talked about during the campaign, that the decade of squeeze that the middle class experienced, even as the economy was growing, prior to the recession -- while incomes were growing on the upper end in the first decade of this century, middle class incomes were stagnating, and in some cases, shrinking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that remains the President\xe2\x80\x99s primary focus when he talks about economic growth and job creation, is growing the economy for the benefit of all Americans, and creating jobs -- the kinds of jobs that pay well in industries that stay in this country and help fuel this economy in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me take one more stab at this.\xc2\xa0 Okay, government programs -- funding to government programs will be cut after this process.\xc2\xa0 Also jobs will be cut -- many jobs will be cut because of this.\xc2\xa0 When do you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that jobs will be cut.\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When do you expect that there will be -- really people will say, okay, the worst is now gone?\xc2\xa0 The worst of the storm is over?\xc2\xa0 When will -- when is the prediction of the White House for that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re -- I think the job of improving the economy in the U.S. is never done, and this President will be working on that through the last day that he serves a President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact is, is that we are in a better situation -- a far better situation now than we were when the President took the oath of office in January of 2009.\xc2\xa0 But work remains to be done. And as he works with Congress to reduce the deficit further, to get our fiscal house in order, he has as a primary focus the need to protect the investments that will allow us to grow and create jobs going forward, and also as a primary focus in terms of seniors, the disabled and others that we not take measures in the name of deficit reduction and debt reduction that are unbalanced and do not share -- distribute the burden, as well as distribute the prosperity that we believe will come.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And let me -- okay.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions, first on the debt ceiling tonight.\xc2\xa0 Many of the freshmen Republicans in the House who are driving the no vote have suggested that this is only a preliminary vote, and that going a few weeks before there is a final vote will just lead to the spending cuts they seek.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Bill Huizenga of Michigan for one said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between two weeks and two months.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What do you say to criticism such as that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we -- what the difference between two weeks and two months being --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s not a clean vote tomorrow, and then have another vote on it later on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, all I can say is that the deficit -- the debt ceiling needs to be raised by something close to a date certain, as we all know.\xc2\xa0 Not doing that would have calamitous, catastrophic, disastrous effects on the economy.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think\xc2\xa0 -- there may be a handful of people who just disbelieve the overwhelming consensus opinion about what would happen if the United States of America defaulted on its obligations.\xc2\xa0 I think the overwhelming opinion is correct, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the opinion we share, and that ultimately the elected members of Congress are here representing their constituents in order to ensure economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And to do things that have the opposite effect I don\'t think is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not good policy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also not good politics.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other question I wanted to mention was with all of the controversy swirling around the International Monetary Fund, plus the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The tardiness in Greece making some of the reforms it was talking about, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, has issued -- offered legislation that would roll back and limit the $100 billion credit line the U.S. has with the IMF, and particularly keep U.S. tax dollars away from European bailouts.\xc2\xa0 Is this --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that legislation, so I don\'t really -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on it since I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 About the nomination of Mr. Bryson, actually Mr. Bryson right now is heavily invested in and also cooperating with Chinese electric car companies.\xc2\xa0 And they are about to import the cars from China to the U.S. in the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the implication of his nomination in terms of his tie with China?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of any relationship he has either by serving on a board or in any capacity with companies of any sort, he has to follow the same procedures that any nominee for this kind of position would have to follow, which is resign that position and -- in the case of at least Boeing and Disney -- have to recuse himself from any particular matters that might come before him as Commerce Secretary.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about the specific area that you just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 But in general, like any other nominee, he has to follow those procedures.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President in thinking about his experience in China will help his --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that the wealth of his experience in a variety of industries and in a variety of capacities both in the private sector and the public sector comes together to make him an excellent nominee and somebody he believes will be a highly effective Commerce Secretary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one -- only one question?\xc2\xa0 Just one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 O-N-E.\xc2\xa0 One -- no more than one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in the blue shirt.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried at all about a filibuster threat over your Commerce Secretary nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I answered a question earlier about holding it up for whatever reason and I talked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the three free trade agreements that he wants to see Congress pass, his commitment to the extension of TAA, and he obviously feels strongly that this is an important position that should be filled and should not be held up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, on a separate front, some House GOP appropriators are complaining that the White House is taking too long with its signal on whether it\xe2\x80\x99s going to send a supplemental package, an emergency package for storm aid.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any updates on if the White House, if the administration is going to send a request for emergency funding for the storms.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I plead ignorance on that one.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have indications.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is from U.S. News and World Report --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Victoria, last one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Biden talks apparently are going fairly well, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a big obstacle, the big stumbling block, which is that the Republicans say that taxes have to be off the table and the Vice President says that taxes should be on the table.\xc2\xa0 What is it that the White House can do to bridge that gap somehow if indeed you\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forward?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into the details of those negotiations -- because I think part of the reason why they\xe2\x80\x99ve been effective is that the participants feel that everyone is negotiating in good faith and keeping that process running by not divulging every detail the minute the meeting ends -- I would just say that our position is well known.\xc2\xa0 We believe that long-term, serious, deep deficit reduction and debt reduction has to come with a balanced approach that includes looking at tax expenditures as well as entitlements, as well as discretionary spending, including defense spending.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we don\'t expect that we will resolve all of these difficult issues in this process, necessarily.\xc2\xa0 But we can certainly reach agreement on areas of common ground, where people, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, where people come in here -- come in there and negotiate in good faith and understand that neither side is going to get 100 percent of what it wants --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can you offer them to bring them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that -- again, I think the sheer -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working very hard to make sure that these practices are -- that these negotiations are effective.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you work --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked this so many ways in this briefing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 3:12 P.M.
