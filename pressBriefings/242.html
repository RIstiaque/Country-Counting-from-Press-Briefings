Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:13 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Monday. \xc2\xa0I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so we can go directly to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0We are approaching yet another deadline, I guess we can call it, on the Iran talks, where either the parties are going to have to extend the JPOA or reach a deal. \xc2\xa0What is your expectation of what happens over the next few hours?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Julie, what we do expect is that the Joint Plan of Action will remain in place. \xc2\xa0And the reasons for that is this is the interim agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place for a little over a year and a half now that has frozen Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program in place and rolled it back in some key areas. \xc2\xa0Now, obviously, if we can reach a final agreement, then that would supersede the interim agreement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the talks continue in Vienna. \xc2\xa0The thing that I can tell you is that they have made genuine progress in those conversations and I think even over the last week or so, there is progress -- important progress that has been made. \xc2\xa0There have been some key issues in the negotiations that have been closed and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, there continue to be some sticking points that remain unresolved. \xc2\xa0And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for the better part of a couple weeks now, the President has directed his team to remain engaged and participate in conversations as long as those conversations remain useful. \xc2\xa0And given the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made and given the success that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in closing out some key issues, that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the talks are useful.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President has also been clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s a bottom line that must be met, and that is making sure that any final agreement lives up to the parameters that were established in Lausanne. \xc2\xa0And there will not be a final agreement agreed to by the United States at least and by our P5+1 partners until the final agreement reflects that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So based on what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there, it sounds like the President is willing to let John Kerry and the negotiators stay past today because he feels the talks continue to be productive?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for them to continue conversations and if the conversations remain useful, the negotiating team will remain in Vienna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I guess the question that a lot of people have about this is because so much of this is happening behind closed doors, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what is actually being agreed upon and what is not being agreed upon. \xc2\xa0And I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a great sense of why the President feels like another two days, another three days will close the door on all these issues that have opened for months.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely legitimate question. \xc2\xa0The chief obstacle to us providing greater insight about what is exactly occurring behind closed doors is this key tenet of our talks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been repeating for a couple of years now, which is that nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m asking it not even in terms of the specifics, but is it that he has seen the Iranians make concessions on key issues? \xc2\xa0What is it that he has seen from the Iranians that leads him to believe they would continue to move closer to the U.S. position if you just keep this going?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think because as the negotiations have gone on over the last couple of weeks, what started out as a rather long list of differences has slowly -- I would acknowledge slowly -- but steadily narrowed. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that we are making progress toward an agreement. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I would describe the talks as making genuine progress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that typically some of the most difficult issues are the ones that get kicked to the end. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is going to resist any effort to sort of fast-forward through the closing here. \xc2\xa0There continue to be significant issues that remain, and the President will not sign on to an agreement -- and this is the attitude that\xe2\x80\x99s taken by our P5+1 partners, too -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sign on to an agreement until all of our concerns have been addressed. \xc2\xa0And as long as they continue to make progress in doing that, then the talks will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President had any conversations with Secretary Kerry over the last few days over the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has been in touch with his National Security Advisor, Susan Rice. \xc2\xa0And she has been the one that has been principally updating him a couple times a day about the status of the talks. \xc2\xa0Those briefings for the President occurred even over the weekend -- those updates to the President occurred even over the weekend. \xc2\xa0And I know the President has been in touch with the negotiating team in Vienna as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have not been any secure video teleconferences since the one that we announced last week, but the President is very well aware of where things stand.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, with no firm deadline in place on these talks, do you have any idea of when the interim agreement may be lifted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, so the issue is this, is that the interim agreement has been extended two or three days at a time two or three times now. \xc2\xa0The latest short-term extension is up at the end of the day today. \xc2\xa0If the talks are not completed today, then the interim agreement will be extended again. \xc2\xa0And this is by essentially as a result of the unanimous view that this interim agreement has been helpful. \xc2\xa0And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s true of many Republicans in Congress who originally criticized the interim agreement. \xc2\xa0It also happens to be the view of our P5+1 partners and of Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so there is a unified commitment to making sure that that interim agreement remains in place, but the whole idea of an interim agreement is it remains in place only until a final agreement can be reached. \xc2\xa0And so what we would envision is a final agreement that would enter into effect to replace the interim agreement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, but I imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s not indefinite. \xc2\xa0I mean, what would have to happen to lift that and -- would it be walking away from these talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen or what would happen if one party or another were to walk away from the talks. \xc2\xa0What we know is that the interim agreement has been useful while the talks have been ongoing to freeze Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program in place and to roll it back in some key areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then will this be for another three days each time, or will it -- is it indefinitely extended?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, if there is a need to extend to interim agreement even for a short-term period, that\xe2\x80\x99s an announcement that would be made by the United States and our P5+1 partners in Vienna. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not something I\xe2\x80\x99ll announce here. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m merely trying to project here is confidence that if a final agreement is not reached by the end of the day today, that all of the parties will agree to at least a short-term extension of the interim agreement to allow the conversations to continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Shifting to criminal justice. \xc2\xa0I know the President is traveling to Philadelphia tomorrow, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to the NAACP and lay out his ideas for criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0And he said today that many of those ideas have already come up in Congress. \xc2\xa0And also, there have been many ideas that have come up and been stalled, even when Democrats had control of the Senate last year. \xc2\xa0Why does he think that anything might be different now? \xc2\xa0What are the chances of getting something through, like the Smarter Sentencing Act?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be blunt about it, because Republicans are indicating an openness to doing it. \xc2\xa0Democrats have long been strong advocates of criminal justice reform that would make our criminal justice system more fair. \xc2\xa0There are clearly some inequities that can be and should be rectified, but they will require legislation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate, which means any proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass both houses of Congress will require bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0And since Democrats have been steadfast supporters of trying to bring some important reforms to our criminal justice system, we welcome indications from some Republicans that reforms -- that they also believe that reforms are necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the basis for some of the bipartisan conversations that have already occurred on this issue. \xc2\xa0The President hosted one of those conversations earlier this year, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional bipartisan conversations that include the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that we hope we can advance this priority, is by working in bipartisan fashion.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that Congress has a particularly strong track record of doing, but there have been areas where that has been successful, and we\'re hopeful that we can add criminal justice reform to the list of areas where Congress was able to act in bipartisan fashion to do something good for the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Rand Paul was one of those Republicans that the President has talked about it before. \xc2\xa0Has he spoken with him lately about this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t believe so. \xc2\xa0But I obviously don\'t read out every single conversation the President has with members of Congress, but I\'m not aware of any recent conversations on this. \xc2\xa0But you\'re right, Senator Paul, to his credit, is somebody that has demonstrated and signaled a willingness to be a good partner with the Obama administration on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if you look at the numbers, the President is behind some of his predecessors in this category in terms of commutations and pardons, although it appears he\xe2\x80\x99s doing some catching up. \xc2\xa0Is this something that we should see or that we might see accelerate over his remaining time in office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I would say, Jim, in terms of the raw numbers of commutations, the announcement today of 46 commutations is actually the largest number of commutations that\'s been issued by a President on a single day dating back to at least the Johnson administration. \xc2\xa0And this brings to I believe it\'s 89 -- that\'s the number of people who have received a commutation from the President of the United States, and that actually is more than the number of commutations issued by the four previous Presidents combined. \xc2\xa0So the President has taken pretty bold action when it comes to commutations.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the point that you\'re raising --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Pardons, then, I guess. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, the pardons is a bit of a different story. \xc2\xa0But I think that the point that you\'re raising, however, is an entirely legitimate one, and that is that there are significant reforms that need to be implemented into our criminal justice system. \xc2\xa0And the President is hopeful that he can work with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to advance a legislative solution to address some of those inequities. \xc2\xa0He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to just have to rely on his constitutional authority as President of the United States to offer commutations. \xc2\xa0He actually is hopeful that we can develop and implement a legislative solution that would have a broader, more far-reaching impact in bringing greater fairness and justice to our criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s visiting a federal prison on Thursday. \xc2\xa0How is that going to work? \xc2\xa0I assume you guys are pretty confident that this is going to be safe and should go smoothly.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We do continue to have confidence that the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit will be safe. \xc2\xa0There will have to be some unique steps that we\'ll take to ensure the safety of the President and others who will be participating in that event. \xc2\xa0But it\'s certainly an opportunity that the President is looking forward to. \xc2\xa0And he\'ll have an opportunity to speak to all of you about it while he\xe2\x80\x99s there.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And speaking of prison security, any response from this White House to the escape of \xe2\x80\x9cEl Chapo\xe2\x80\x9d down in Mexico?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s those rather colorful news reports. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch, telephoned her counterpart yesterday to offer the full support of the United States government to the Mexican government as they undertake an operation to try to recapture Mr. Guzman. \xc2\xa0Obviously the United States is very interested in making sure that Mr. Guzman is brought to justice. He faces very serious crimes not just in Mexico, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been charged with some very serious crimes in the United States as well. \xc2\xa0And the United States will support the efforts of the Mexican government to bring him to justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a quick clarification and two quick questions. \xc2\xa0 So if you don\'t reach an agreement, is this interim agreement or the Joint Plan of Action -- can it be extended for weeks or months, and not just days? \xc2\xa0My question is, is it legally binding, or is it just a political framework that a high-level agreement has to be reached and it\'s not going to be -- it will be redundant after that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can\'t speak to the legally binding nature of it. \xc2\xa0I\'d refer you to the State Department who presumably has an attorney who can discuss sort of the legal consequences of all of this. \xc2\xa0What we have found, though, is that the interim agreement over the last year and a half or so that it\'s been in place has been effective in freezing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program in place and rolling it back in some key areas. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why the United States and our P5+1 partners have found it useful to continue to extend the agreement while the talks continue, even though the talks have extended on for a period of time longer than we believed originally would be necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My question is it\'s still more than a few days, more than the deadline of expected days --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, the agreement has been in place -- well, let\xe2\x80\x99s step one step back just to give you a greater deal of context here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was concern when the United States and our P5+1 partners originally entered into negotiations with the Iranians that the Iranians would merely use the cover of diplomatic conversations to continue to advance their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0This is something they had done in the past and was something that many people were concerned about, including the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this particular approach was taken, which is to let\xe2\x80\x99s enter into an agreement as we enter the final talks to ensure that that can\xe2\x80\x99t happen, that we can\xe2\x80\x99t just drag out the talks so that they can advance their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, in essence, that interim agreement has been in place to facilitate conversations, and that is what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to complete. \xc2\xa0And obviously if we can complete the negotiations, then there would be no need for an interim agreement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you raise another question, which is, well, would the agreement that was originally in place to support negotiations remain in place even if negotiations are no longer ongoing? \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a question that, frankly, I haven\'t contemplated at this point. \xc2\xa0But what we have indicted is that if conversations were to break down, that the President would continue to have all options on the table before him. \xc2\xa0But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate at this point how exactly we\xe2\x80\x99d prepare for that scenario. \xc2\xa0Our hope is that the negotiators will continue to make progress and eventually reach a final agreement that would then go into effect and eliminate the need for the interim agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Iraq, the Iraqi army launched an operation to retake Anbar with the Popular Forces. \xc2\xa0What changed from two months ago to now? \xc2\xa0How confident are you in the ability of the Iraqi army that they retake Anbar?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there had been, Nadia, remember, some speculation by some observers that the central government in Iraq had not been as effective as necessary to resupply those troops who were in Ramadi and were doing important work to try to protect that city. \xc2\xa0So, obviously, over the last couple of months, the Iraqi government has had an opportunity to organize their efforts in Anbar Province, to ensure that the security forces reflect the diverse population of Iraq. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the United States has indicated is that the United States and our coalition partners will be supportive of those forces that are under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. \xc2\xa0And we have made clear that we believe that those forces should take extra care, even as they are carrying out these security operations, to protect the basic human rights of the population there.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is obviously something that reflects a decision made by the Iraqi government. \xc2\xa0This is obviously an operation that\xe2\x80\x99s led by the Iraqi military. \xc2\xa0But those forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government can expect to have the support of the United States and our coalition partners as they undertake these operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that I understand is that, in recent days, our coalition has actually significantly stepped up the pace of military airstrikes in Iraq -- the majority of those airstrikes coming in Anbar. \xc2\xa0So that is an indication of the ongoing coordination between the Iraqi military and the United States and our coalition partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last question. \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get into the military details, but just politically -- the Wall Street Journal is reporting that you are coordinating with North African countries to have airbases to be used to launch drones against ISIS in Libya. \xc2\xa0Can you kind of go into some details about which countries are you coordinating with? \xc2\xa0And is this within the policy of the administration like we did in Yemen, to target al Qaeda using drones only?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are obviously a number of details that I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into from here, but let me try to answer your question the best that I can. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me start by saying that the United States coordinates closely with countries throughout North Africa and Europe who also share our concerns about the extremist threat that emanates from Libya. \xc2\xa0We are seeing, and we have seen a concerted effort by some extremists in Libya to capitalize on the chaos in that country, to establish a foothold and carry out extremist acts of violence not just in Libya but even in some surrounding countries. \xc2\xa0And we saw this terrible terrorist attack in Tunisia just 10 days or so ago. \xc2\xa0So we continue to be concerned about the growing threat from extremists that are operating in Libya, and we are going to continue to coordinate both on security matters and intelligence matters with countries in the region. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll note that the United States recently entered into this Major Non-NATO Ally agreement with Tunisia. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the ramped-up security coordination between the United States and Tunisia. \xc2\xa0The United States has a longstanding security relationship with Egypt, and there is additional military assistance that was recently provided to Egypt as they confront some of the security challenges in their country as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the United States has some deep ties in the region that we will use to try to improve the security posture of countries in the region that are most likely at risk here, but also to protect the broader national security interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about this -- and I probably should have said this first -- but our primary effort with respect to Libya remains focused on the political negotiations. \xc2\xa0And this goes back to what I was just describing, which is that we have seen extremist elements try to capitalize on the chaos inside of Libya to carry out acts of violence. \xc2\xa0And so the best way for us to eliminate the ability of those extremist groups to operate in Libya is to actually support an effective central government in Libya that can provide for the security situation of the entire country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there have been some ongoing U.N.-facilitated efforts in Morocco to try to bring about this political solution, and there was an agreement that was recently initialed in Morocco among the parties who are participating in those talks. \xc2\xa0And the United States has been strongly supportive of the U.N. effort to try to bring about that political resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0On the prison visit later this week, will the President meet with any inmates who have clemency petitions in the pipeline? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President will have the opportunity to meet with some inmates. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t at this point have details about who will participate in those conversations, but in advance of Thursday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then on the Iran deal -- when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Martin Dempsey, says the United States should absolutely not ease restrictions on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ability to acquire missile technology or conventional weapons, does he speak for the administration?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, so -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look for this Iran deal to ease either of those things?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think you can certainly rely on Chairman Dempsey to provide not just -- certainly his own personal point of view, but also a point of view that reflects the kind of advice the President\xe2\x80\x99s receiving from his uniform military leaders as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJon Karl.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So let me clarify on that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is lifting the arms embargo on Iran on the table in the final stages of these negotiations?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, what we know is that there are a number of U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program that are under discussion as part of essentially an exchange that would -- this is the essence of the negotiations -- that Iran would take steps to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon in response to relief that they could get from sanctions that had been applied to their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of the negotiations that have been going on for more than a year and a half. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s those sanctions that have actually compelled Iran to participate in these conversations. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of relief they\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m asking specifically about the arms embargo, which, as I understand, is separate from the sanctions that are imposed because of the nuclear program. \xc2\xa0Is the administration -- is the President willing to see the lifting of the arms embargo on Iran? Will he -- would he go along with that under any circumstances?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into the details of the ongoing --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You won\'t rule out that the President would sign off on lifting the arms embargo on Iran?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\'m suggesting is we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that the sanctions relief to which Iran could be entitled in the context of these negotiations would be those sanctions that have been applied to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are a number of sanctions that have been applied to Iran because of their nuclear program and the possible weaponization of their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of this whole negotiation -- that applying those sanctions is what compelled them to the negotiating table in the first place, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what has isolated them from the international community. \xc2\xa0And ultimately what we have sought is to get Iran to agree to demonstrate clearly beyond a shadow of a doubt that their nuclear program exists solely for peaceful purposes, and that in exchange for that demonstration they would receive sanctions relief. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0But I\'m asking specifically about the arms embargo. \xc2\xa0Let me come at it a slightly different way. \xc2\xa0Iran has been on the official State Sponsors of Terrorism list since the 90s -- since earlier, a long time. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no plan to take Iran off the official State Sponsors of Terrorism list is there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have been clear that the -- we have been very clear about the fact that the significant concerns we have with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior will persist even after an agreement is reached, if one can be reached.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no plan to take them off the State Sponsors of Terrorism list?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about exactly what is the essence of these ongoing negotiations. \xc2\xa0And that is the sanctions that have been applied to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program at the United Nations in exchange for them shutting down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0That obviously is very different than a consideration about their inclusion on the State Sponsors of Terror list. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\'m asking about the arms embargo. \xc2\xa0How could you consider lifting a ban on sales of military equipment to and from Iran if you still consider them a state sponsor of terrorism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\'m not going to get into the essence of the negotiations. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be as clear as we possibly can about this -- that the kind of sanctions relief that is envisioned in this conversation are those sanctions that are applied to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then one last thing. \xc2\xa0Jason Rezaian -- another hearing before this secretive court. \xc2\xa0Is there any indication that any of the Americans who are known to be held prisoner by Iran, Rezaian, Hekmati, Abedini, is there any indication that any of them will be freed before an agreement is reached?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the status of our efforts to secure the release of those Americans who are being unjustly detained by Iran. \xc2\xa0You named three of them -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s 11.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s right. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly concerned about the fact that Mr. Rezaian, Mr. Abedini and Mr. Hekmati are being unjustly detained in Iran. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some serious questions about the whereabouts of Robert Levinson. \xc2\xa0And these are concerns about the treatment of these American citizens by Iran that we have raised on the sidelines of these nuclear talks. But we have -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we continue to press, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update at this point on those ongoing efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJ.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If, in fact, a deal is not reached and the U.S. may walk away from the table, how concerned is this administration that Saudi Arabia will enter a nuclear arms race? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, J.C., one of the reasons that we have sought to pursue a diplomatic opportunity to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is the risk that exists that if Iran does obtain a nuclear weapon that it could set off a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. \xc2\xa0That would be destabilizing to an already volatile region of the world. \xc2\xa0It also would have a negative impact on the national security interests of the United States. \xc2\xa0It obviously would not be good for our closest ally in the region, Israel. \xc2\xa0So that is one of the reasons that we have sought to capitalize on the best opportunity we have to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that\xe2\x80\x99s pursuing this diplomatic opening.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you said at the top, key issues -- there have been some key issues that have been closed. \xc2\xa0Can you give us an idea of what they are?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned to Julie, those issues have been closed. \xc2\xa0The reason I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x9cagreed to\xe2\x80\x9d is that nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. \xc2\xa0So it means that we believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten those key issues into a good place -- essentially the negotiations around some of those key issues have closed. \xc2\xa0But they are contingent on resolving the concerns that have been expressed by everybody around the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me try it in this way. \xc2\xa0There are issues related to sanctions that Jonathon just brought up, and there were underlying technical details -- inspections, application of the Joint Plan of Action. \xc2\xa0Broadly speaking, would you say the issues that have been closed fall on the sanctions side, or the technical implementation side of the Joint Plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I just can\xe2\x80\x99t get into any greater detail about those issues that have been closed other than to confirm for you that some of them have been.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0There was a sense this weekend that this was getting closer and closer. \xc2\xa0The President has said as recently as last week, less than 50 percent. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to give us a declaration of -- but do you feel that over the last 72 or 96 hours, you are closer and this is likely to happen? \xc2\xa0More likely than it was, say, three or four days ago? \xc2\xa0Or would you say you\xe2\x80\x99re in exactly the same place you were?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would acknowledge that important progress has been made over the last four or five or six days. \xc2\xa0That is true. \xc2\xa0That said, there continue to be some pretty tough obstacles to a final agreement that remain in place, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what our negotiators are working through. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, in order to complete this agreement, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require Iran to make some tough decisions and to sign off on some significant commitments that shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon and verify their cooperation with an intrusive set of inspections. \xc2\xa0And since ultimately it will be the responsibility of Iran to decide if they can live up to those commitments, that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put a numerical probability on it, because ultimately this will be a decision that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make at the end. \xc2\xa0Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what our bottom lines are and they have a rather opaque process for making these kinds of decisions. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put a specific probability.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut to answer the first part of your question, I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for you to say that over the last four or five or six days, that additional progress has been made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All of us are trying to translate your conversation with Jonathon, so let me try it this way. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0The administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the arms embargo was applied to Iran in reaction to its nuclear program, therefore it is not on the table -- correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Major, I think at this point -- this is exactly the kind of conversation that if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach an agreement will be a lot easier for us to have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, therefore, it is on the table?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying is that once we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to lay out exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the agreement and what\xe2\x80\x99s not, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a much clearer conversation about what exactly has been agreed to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So this part is opaque.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would acknowledge that there are a variety of aspects of this that are opaque.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On their side.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not just on their side. \xc2\xa0The good news is that if an agreement is reached that there will be extensive detail that\xe2\x80\x99s made public that you and the American public will have an opportunity to review. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we would encourage people to do, is to withhold judgment and to evaluate the strength of this argument -- or the strength of this agreement and the way that it protects America\xe2\x80\x99s national security interests based on the details that have actually been agreed to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the commutation issues, what would you say is the President\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for those who would observe that he\xe2\x80\x99s had a long time to deal with this issue and this is late in the game?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would just observe that the number of commutations that have been granted by this President exceed the number of commutations that have been issued by the four previous Presidents combined.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that presupposes that the same problems were on the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- those Presidents\xe2\x80\x99 desks as were on this President\xe2\x80\x99s desk. \xc2\xa0And I believe, if I understand the President correctly, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case, that he has noted, and those working for him have noted this disparity in sentencing and that it cried out for some type of action. \xc2\xa0So to compare numbers suggests, well, they had the exact same problems. \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t have the same -- those Presidents didn\xe2\x80\x99t have this issue to deal with. \xc2\xa0This President has, by his own words.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I think what the numbers illustrate is that the President has taken an historic step today and --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why not earlier?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that there -- I guess there are a couple of reasons for that. \xc2\xa0The first is that these applications for clemency are very carefully considered. \xc2\xa0They go through a very rigorous process and there is an effort by the Department of Justice to make sure that the individuals who are then considered by the President for a commutation fit the criteria that the President has laid out. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the criteria that the President has discussed is non-violent offenders, essentially low-level offenders, in many cases, who, if they were sentenced today would get a substantially shorter sentence and, in many of those cases, would actually have, if sentenced under the rules that are in place today, would have actually already served their time and been released by this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the kind of disparity that the President is trying to rectify. \xc2\xa0And the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to take this step without substantially negatively affecting public safety. \xc2\xa0And that obviously is a principal consideration as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been pretty up front about the fact that this kind of executive action is not a substitute for the kind of legislative action that we believe is necessary to address some of the more widespread disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last thing. \xc2\xa0On coverage Thursday, it has been suggested to us -- and I know these things are constantly being reviewed, so I ask you to review them on behalf of everyone in the association, but specifically the White House pool that will travel with the President, that they be given maximum access to the President not just for his remarks in some prison yard, but in the part of the facility that he will go himself. \xc2\xa0This being a historic event for this President, the first of its kind, to my understanding, the White House press pool should have as much access as possible. \xc2\xa0And I urge you to err on the side of maximum coverage and access for those who travel with the President and the government on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'ll see what we can do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Alexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can I ask a question on commutations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to repeat the question I had asked last week, and that is how would the President like these 46 individuals to be used if, in the minds of lawmakers, he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to persuade? \xc2\xa0In other words, is there something about their cases that he -- more than the number, that these individuals that he wants to point to, to showcase a point he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the case that the President is trying to make is that that there are -- that, again, these are individuals who are non-violent, low-level offenders. \xc2\xa0These are individuals the vast majority of whom would receive a substantially shorter sentence if they had been convicted under the rules that are currently in place. \xc2\xa0And, in many cases, these individuals would have actually served their time and already been released by this standpoint had they been convicted under the terms -- or under the rules and conditions that are in place today.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President does believe that that illustrates some inequities in our criminal justice system, and it does illustrate that there probably is a better way that we can spend taxpayer dollars. \xc2\xa0And some of these individuals who have been commuted today, who have had their sentences commuted today, are individuals who were sentenced to life in prison, even though they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a violent record.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, in the view of the President, there probably are some better things we can spend taxpayer dollars on, and there are certainly some things that we can do to make our criminal justice more fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, each of these cases was considered individually. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to use this power judiciously. \xc2\xa0But there is something important that Congress can do about it, and we hope that they will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you add whether, on top of these 46, whether the President now hopes to continue to do this on some sort of recurring basis. \xc2\xa0In other words, the effort that he\xe2\x80\x99s made through the Justice Department to review these petitions and go through them sequentially, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep doing that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule to lay out for you, but I certainly would expect that the President would consider the use of this kind of executive authority in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, one detail -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you know the answer. \xc2\xa0These are effective November 10th -- four months from now. \xc2\xa0Is there something that is specific to the four-month effective date?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is. \xc2\xa0What I would do is I would encourage you to talk to the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0They have a system for helping these inmates, some of whom have been in prison for an extended period of time, transition back into public life, if you will. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what this -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a 120-day period for transition. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll look into this for you. \xc2\xa0But essentially it\xe2\x80\x99s over the course of that 120 days. There are things like halfway houses and other forms of training and assistance that can be provided to these individuals to prepare for their eventual release.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule -- if, by chance, there is a deal in Iran and the President is traveling, would he respond while he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling, or would he adjust his schedule?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say exactly how things are going to come about. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously keep all of you apprised of the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Given that there\xe2\x80\x99s also a human factor to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Switzerland, and an understandable level of exhaustion, do you rule out then at this point, should we go into yet another day, that they could stop and start again, that they would take any time off? \xc2\xa0Or is it your sense they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to power through and either have a deal or walk away?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the expectation right now is that the talks will continue, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any plans to take a break. \xc2\xa0They surely deserve it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s what anybody has planned.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if I could ask you just a few things about Mr. Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s escape. \xc2\xa0Does this in any way point to the need for swift deportations, particularly of drug kingpins?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously when Mr. Guzman was originally taken to custody about a year and a half ago, the United States did communicate clearly to the Mexican government our view that Mr. Guzman should face the charges that have been imposed against him here in the United States. \xc2\xa0The charges are serious and we believe that he should face justice, and we made that clear to the Mexican government. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, they\xe2\x80\x99re a sovereign government. \xc2\xa0They have their own responsibilities for ensuring that Mexican citizens who are being -- who are charged with serious crimes under the Mexican criminal justice system face justice in that country as well. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve made quite clear to the Mexicans our interest in ensuring that he faces justice here in the United States, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be supportive of the effort that\xe2\x80\x99s already underway by Mexican authorities to recapture him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Chicago Crime Commission, which is a well-known crime-fighting organization in the President\xe2\x80\x99s hometown, had named Guzman public enemy number one, and I think that was the first designation since Al Capone that they had done until he was recaptured the last time. \xc2\xa0And now, they\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about -- that this might signal a resurgence of the Sinaloa Cartel, which obviously has been a major supplier in Chicago of both heroin and cocaine. \xc2\xa0I just wonder if there\xe2\x80\x99s been any conversations with the White House what the level of concern is about the possible reemergence of the Sinaloa.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the -- obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about making sure that Mr. Guzman is brought to justice. \xc2\xa0And he does have a long rap sheet, and does preside over an organization that has committed a significant number of crimes, and does pose a threat to public safety not just in Mexico but in the United States as well. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that Mr. Guzman should face justice and face the very serious charges that have been put in place against him. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States is going to be supportive of the ongoing efforts by Mexican authorities to recapture him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you mentioned the statement that Loretta Lynch put out, that they\xe2\x80\x99re standing by to help with, potentially, the manhunt. \xc2\xa0Can you give us any more details about what kind of assistance the U.S. might offer? \xc2\xa0Or has any specific assistance been requested?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there obviously is a strong security cooperation effort between the United States and Mexico. \xc2\xa0Particularly in the case of Mr. Guzman, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the interest of both of our countries that are at stake. \xc2\xa0But obviously, Mexico, again, is a sovereign government and a sovereign country. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the principal responsibility of making sure that Mr. Guzman has been recaptured. \xc2\xa0But the Mexican government can count on the support of the United States as they undertake that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the question of clemency, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that it\xe2\x80\x99s a rigorous process where there\xe2\x80\x99s a review, but at this point, you have something like 35,000 prisoners who have applied for clemency. \xc2\xa0Can you talk at all about what\xe2\x80\x99s slowing the process down? \xc2\xa0Are there any specific steps that are being taken? And realistically, you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how criminal justice reform would be needed to make a major change, but how many people realistically could be pardoned by the end of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time in office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Juliet, this is a rigorous process, and so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice to give you an update in terms of how that process works and how much bandwidth there is in that process to process applications and ensure that each of them receives the careful, individual consideration that they both need and deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at this point, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on a number or a capacity for that particular process. \xc2\xa0But I do think the numbers that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing highlight how important it is for Congress to take action; that congressional action, in this case, could be much broader in terms of delivering the kind of justice and implementing the kind of reforms that the President believes is long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0On the criminal justice reform push in Congress, Senator Grassley is obviously going to play a major role here. \xc2\xa0So does the White House view -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s sent some mixed signals on this issue in the past and currently. \xc2\xa0So does the White House see him as a partner on this, or is he --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with Senator Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s positions or comments on this particular issue. \xc2\xa0But we obviously would welcome support for a genuinely bipartisan effort from anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s willing to offer it, particularly somebody like Senator Grassley that will, as you point out, have an opportunity to have a substantial impact on the outcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, on the prison visit, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it usually a bar to attending a presidential event a criminal record?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No pun intended?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, a serious question. \xc2\xa0Usually, if somebody has a criminal record, they don\xe2\x80\x99t get to attend a presidential event.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a hard and fast rule that this administration has implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will there be inmates in both the audience for his remarks and private meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on the logistics of the visit later this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on clemency, although he has made a big jump in commutations, he is still far behind most of his predecessors on pardons. \xc2\xa0Is he aware of that? \xc2\xa0Is he aware that many people feel he\xe2\x80\x99s stingy on pardons?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of that -- I can confirm for you that he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the numbers. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the \xe2\x80\x9cstingy\xe2\x80\x9d label that some have offered him. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus right now is on using his executive authority to try to correct as many injustices as possible, but also to try to work constructively in bipartisan fashion to help Congress enact the kinds of reforms that the President can\xe2\x80\x99t by acting on his own.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0Is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s idea that more needs to be done to restore voting rights for felons to get them back into the workforce? \xc2\xa0Is that his overall position? \xc2\xa0And what would he say to people who say if you\xe2\x80\x99ve done the crime, we ought not be using more of our money, frankly, from a public policy position, to give them more or to do more for them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things about that, Kevin. \xc2\xa0The first is that the President has spoken -- I got asked about this I think on Friday -- and the President has spoken previously of his support for allowing those individuals who have served their time to have their voting rights restored. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the President alludes to in the letter that he sent to the 46 individuals who are seeing their sentence be commuted, that the United States of America is a country that believes in second chances and believes in redemption, and that it is in the best interest of our country to ensure that those individuals who have served their time, paid their debt to society, have an opportunity to reenter society and be a constructive member of the country. \xc2\xa0And there may be some who disagree with that. \xc2\xa0But I think the President is on pretty firm, bipartisan ground when he says that that would make our country and our criminal justice system more fair.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Broadly speaking, what can the President do to shrink our prison population that dwarfs similar size countries? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously some of the steps that are related to commutations -- well, let me say it this way --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You have a long way to go when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the numbers we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I was just going to say that. \xc2\xa0Look, the fact is, that is one step that the President can take. \xc2\xa0But I would acknowledge -- and again, I think the numbers bear this out -- that when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the number of people who would benefit from reforms and deserve some reforms in the criminal justice system, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a substantial number of people. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why the President is urging Congress to consider and act on important reforms that would make our criminal justice system more fair, but also ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re being good stewards of the taxpayer dollar.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a couple more. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the Iran talks. \xc2\xa0Senate Majority Leader McConnell said over the weekend it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough sell, congressionally speaking, even if a deal is reached. \xc2\xa0How concerned is the President, taking the argument to Capitol Hill? \xc2\xa0And what do you say to those who would argue if sanctions and if the way it\xe2\x80\x99s working out now has applied enough pressure to bring Iran to the table, why not double down on that pressure to really hold them accountable for their behavior and maybe get even more from them?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me address that in a couple of ways. \xc2\xa0I mean, the first is, just to take the last statement first. \xc2\xa0The kind of pressure that has been applied to Iran is significant because it has given Iran the space to make some serious commitments -- at least preliminarily in the context of the Lausanne agreement -- to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that was the aim of the sanctions in the first place. \xc2\xa0The sanctions regime was not put in place to punish Iran. \xc2\xa0There would obviously be ample reason to do that. \xc2\xa0And again, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s because they have unjustly detained some American citizens or because they menace Israel or because they support terrorism, or because they\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in all sorts of destabilizing activities all across the globe, there are a whole lot of reasons to be very concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and about the impact that they have on U.S. national security. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is that there are a set of sanctions that have been put in place against Iran specifically because of their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And the goal of that was to try to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And the idea was simply this -- that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activity in the region or their support for terrorism or their menacing of Israel is a whole lot more dangerous if they have a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And that preventing them from obtaining a nuclear weapon is an important step in trying to prevent the worst kind of behavior from Iran, but it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to prevent all of their bad behavior. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when it comes to the tough sell that Senator McConnell referred to, we welcome the scrutiny and even skepticism of everybody across the country and across the world as they consider this agreement. \xc2\xa0But we continue to be confident that, upon looking at the details, once they have been released, that we will be able to make a strong case about how the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just achieved his goal, but how the international community has achieved the important goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and verifying their compliance with that agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when it comes to a tough sell, I think the tough sell is going to be on the part of Republicans if they try to tank the deal. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough sell to say that the United States should back away from an international agreement. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough sell to say that the United States should throw away the best possible avenue for preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough sell to suggest that we should undermine the international sanctions that have been so effectively put in place thus far. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough sell to say, you know what, we should just foreclose a diplomatic option and only consider the military option before us. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot of confidence in the ability that we have to advocate for this agreement. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a pretty tough sell on the part of Republicans to suggest that this is something that we should walk away from.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last, I want to ask you about the OPM hack. \xc2\xa0The Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who gets regular cyber briefings, told us on the record that the same entity that was behind the OPM hack was also behind the hack of BlueCross-Anthem earlier this year. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s about 80 million people. \xc2\xa0Has the White House learned of this? \xc2\xa0Have you all been briefed of this? \xc2\xa0Is the President aware of this? \xc2\xa0And what does that say about possible Chinese incursion into American cybersecurity?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information at this point about -- or at least I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information to discuss publicly about who may have been responsible for the cyber breach at the Office of Personnel Management.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0There are about three weeks left until Congress leaves for its August recess and then only a few weeks after that until the end of the fiscal year. \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that budget negotiations on budget caps and sequestration, does that need to start before the August recess?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Cheryl, we certainly believe that Congress should not wait until the last minute to fulfill their basic responsibility. \xc2\xa0And this is the most fundamental responsibility that any Congress has, which is to pass a budget for the federal government of the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is the basic responsibility of Congress, and there is no reason that Congress should wait until the last minute and risk, or have people worried, about the possibility of a government shutdown. \xc2\xa0So we are hopeful that Republicans will sit down with Democrats who have indicated an openness and a desire to try to begin these negotiations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is where the negotiations should take place, between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0That is, after all -- that has proven to be the most effective way for Democrats and Republicans in Congress to resolve their differences and to strike the kind of bipartisan agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to pass the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the administration will be available to facilitate those agreements -- or those negotiations. \xc2\xa0And quite frankly, the administration is going to be pretty strongly supportive of Democrats who are participating in those negotiations because our priorities are the same. \xc2\xa0Republicans have a different set of priorities. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be required is for Democrats and Republicans in Congress to try to find some common ground. \xc2\xa0That sounds like a tall order right now, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something that Congress has been able to achieve in the past and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they will this time, too. \xc2\xa0We just hope that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it without having to suffer through -- or put the country through a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And have you heard anything from Republicans about why they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go ahead and start now?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0Have you? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJerome.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Earlier today, Greece reached an agreement with the Eurozone leaders. \xc2\xa0Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal for Greece, for Europe and for the United States? \xc2\xa0And how do you look at the role Germany played over the last few days?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We had a little bit of a betting pool about whether or not anybody was going to ask about this today, so somebody somewhere is excited. \xc2\xa0Our mantra here is that nobody asks about good news so, Jerome, you proved them wrong today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States welcomes the agreement that was reached today between Greece and its creditors. \xc2\xa0The agreement reflects a commitment by Greece\xe2\x80\x99s creditors to provide financial support and help create a path for Greece to return to growth and achieve debt sustainability. \xc2\xa0It also includes the commitment by Greece to make deep and difficult fiscal and structural reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have long identified as the potential solution is one that was focused on a package of reforms and financing that would put Greece back on a path of economic growth and debt sustainability. \xc2\xa0And this seems to be a credible step in that direction. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there are still some important decisions and important steps that need to be taken, but we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that all sides will make the difficult decisions and follow through on the important work that needs to get done.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am in the back. \xc2\xa0Yes, you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve been mentioning the need to work in bipartisan fashion on the criminal justice overhaul. \xc2\xa0Late last month, Congressmen Sensenbrenner and Bobby Scott introduced a comprehensive package. \xc2\xa0And this was the outgrowth of a, I think, more than a year-long side project of the Judiciary Committee to look at the issue. \xc2\xa0Is that your starting point, then? \xc2\xa0Have you talked to them at all about that package? \xc2\xa0Are you guys onboard with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that there have been a number of conversations that have taken place between senior figures in the administration and members of Congress who are interested in this issue. \xc2\xa0The President has hosted at least one of those conversations, as you know. \xc2\xa0I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s only one piece of legislation that the administration has signaled our strong support for, and that is the legislation that was put forward by Senators Durbin and Lee. \xc2\xa0But we would not necessarily limit the discussion just to that piece of legislation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to addition conversations with other members of Congress that have ideas for us to -- for ways that we can reform our criminal justice system to make it more fair. \xc2\xa0The President is not just open to those discussions; he\xe2\x80\x99s actually looking forward to them. \xc2\xa0And so we certainly are interested in entertaining conversations with other members of Congress that have some ideas as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSteve. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, Steve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Mitch McConnell suggested that they\xe2\x80\x99re not likely to confirm a Cuba ambassador, no matter who you nominate or who the President nominates. \xc2\xa0Do you have any quick reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of reflexive opposition to anything that the President proposes that is a hallmark -- been a hallmark, at least -- of this Republican Congress. \xc2\xa0The irony here is there actually is some bipartisan support for the Cuba policy that the President announced at the end of last year. \xc2\xa0And the President and the administration is going to continue working to try to make progress on this policy goal that the President has identified. \xc2\xa0He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly within the best interest of the United States. \xc2\xa0There are important economic opportunities that U.S. businesses can benefit from.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also happens to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the Cuban people. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s some data to indicate that the vast majority of the Cuban people actually agree that this is in the best interest of them and their country. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press these reforms even if -- or this change in policy even if it runs into the reflexive opposition of some Republicans who are interested in catering to some well-established interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the commutation issue, there seem to be some parallels between this and the President\xe2\x80\x99s push a couple years ago for immigration reform, which was he made the big try on Capitol Hill, and when it fell apart he did a huge -- some would call it executive amnesty, affecting millions of people. \xc2\xa0Is this a similar kind of thing where if his big effort on Capitol Hill fails, despite early promise that we should expect towards the end of his term he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have maybe 30,000 or 40,000 -- tens of thousands of people given that amnesty? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Steve, I think I would say that I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that is a -- at this point, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to jump to that conclusion primarily because there seems to be significantly more genuine bipartisan interest in criminal justice reform than there has been in immigration reform. \xc2\xa0I would stipulate that there are a large number of Republicans in Congress that have paid lip service to comprehensive immigration reform but they\xe2\x80\x99ve never actually had the courage to follow up on it. \xc2\xa0I am hopeful and remain optimistic that criminal justice reform will be different.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think based on the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from some members of Congress, including Senator Lee, that I just mentioned, and Senator Paul that we talked about earlier, that there actually is a genuine interest in trying to make progress on criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Congress will take those kinds of reform steps that would have a significant impact on making our criminal justice system more fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you win or lose the bet on Greece? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He lost. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M.
