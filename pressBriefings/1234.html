EST</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Good night.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Before we take and do our regularly scheduled program, John Brennan -- who you all know as the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief counterterror and homeland security advisor -- is going to give us a quick update on a couple things -- some steps that we are taking around the holiday season to ensure security, as well as to discuss some actions that have been taken over the course of the past year after incidents like December 25th and Fort Hood.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to John, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a couple questions afterwards before letting him go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 And good morning, everyone. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs we enter the peak of another holiday season, the homeland security, law enforcement and intelligence communities are collectively focused on doing everything they can to prevent terrorists from disrupting the safety and security of Americans as they travel, spend time with family and friends, and enjoy holiday festivities both at home and abroad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We remain vigilant to attempts by al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations to carry out cowardly attacks against innocent men, women and children.\xc2\xa0 And we are working very closely with other governments to share all threat information immediately and to coordinate closely our counterterrorism and security activities.\xc2\xa0 These international partnerships are critically important to our ability to identify would-be terrorists and to thwart their plans before they are able to act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In response to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s direction, senior officials from departments and agencies met yesterday at the White House to review the latest threat reporting, and to coordinate security and counterterrorism plans that will be in place during the holiday season.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, President Obama has been provided an update on the many steps that have been taken over the past year to enhance our counterterrorism capabilities as a result of the after-action reviews on several terrorism and security-related incidents, including the tragic shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, the attempted bombings of passenger and cargo aircraft, as well as of Times Square in New York City, and a variety of arrests and disruptions of terrorist plots in the homeland.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These enhancements include protocols for strengthened cooperation and information-sharing between the Department of Defense and the FBI; clarified analytical responsibilities and new analytic training courses within the counterterrorism community; improvements and refinements in the watch-listing process, as well as in information technology systems that service the counterterrorism community; the accelerated deployment of advanced imaging technology at domestic airports, and advances in cargo screening and international aviation security cooperation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Protecting the American people from the scourge of terrorism is an ongoing and constantly evolving process.\xc2\xa0 It is the goal of the counterterrorism community to stay several steps ahead of our terrorist adversaries so that we can stop terrorists dead in their tracks before they are able to carry out either small-scale or potentially devastating attacks.\xc2\xa0 That is what the President has directed.\xc2\xa0 That is what the American people rightly expect and deserve.\xc2\xa0 And that is what we are bound and determined to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you have any -- I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk specifically about any intelligence, but is there anything out there that you know about at this point that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of driving this stepped-up effort?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we have discussed previously, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s plans to carry out attacks, and the Department of State had issued an advisory about Europe and about plans by al Qaeda to try to carry out attacks there. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe do not limit our focus to one geographic area.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we are constantly looking at whether or not there is something that is directed at the homeland here.\xc2\xa0 We always receive reporting; what we try to do is to investigate it and to scrutinize it very carefully.\xc2\xa0 So we need to be on top of our game, particularly during the holiday season, but throughout the year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ari.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems as though in the past there was a primary focus on a single catastrophic attack and it sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s been shifting recently to a concern about multiple small attacks. Is that an accurate description of what the landscape is right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned and we are staying vigilant about both ends of that spectrum, as far as a large-scale attack as well as smaller-scale ones.\xc2\xa0 But I think the enhancements that we have made to our security over the past decade has made it much more difficult for terrorists to conduct these large-scale attacks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve degraded their capabilities. We\xe2\x80\x99ve degraded their training capabilities and ability to plot and to move operatives. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we have seen recently is an increased focus, I think, on the part of terrorist groups to try to carry out some of these smaller-scale attacks.\xc2\xa0 And so we are staying very focused on our ability to detect those types of attacks and stop them whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re by individuals or they\xe2\x80\x99re part of a larger organizational effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, should your statement alarm Americans or reassure them that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think what the statement is intended to do is to reassure Americans that their fellow Americans who are working in the homeland security, law enforcement and intelligence communities are working around the clock to protect their fellow citizens.\xc2\xa0 We will not rest because we know that al Qaeda and other organizations are still out there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do our best to disrupt these plots and their plans before they ever make it to the homeland.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we want to do is to let the American people know that we\xe2\x80\x99re on the job, we\xe2\x80\x99re staying vigilant, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners -- and not just our international partners; with our state and local partners as well -- and we will continue to do so throughout the holiday season and beyond.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Dan\xe2\x80\x99s point, to the degree you can speak to this, is there a particular concern during the holidays, given the enormity of passenger travel?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you pointed out, there is a fair amount of volume that is going through the different transportation sectors, whether it be aviation or rail and other areas.\xc2\xa0 So what we want to do is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to provide the security to the traveling public.\xc2\xa0 We also want to make sure that we run to ground any type of report out there about a threat to the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think as Secretary Napolitano said the other day, as far as something specific and credible, we don\xe2\x80\x99t see that.\xc2\xa0 There is a constant stream of reporting throughout the course of the year about al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s plans.\xc2\xa0 So some plans we have that strategic warning; we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to wait for a tactical warning -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be poised every day to respond.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, as you know from last time, the Christmas Day bomber, there was intelligence gathered in the field that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully shared with the appropriate people before the plot moved to execution.\xc2\xa0 Are you confident now that that situation won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely confident that the deficiencies that were identified in the system as a result of the after-action review of the Christmas Day bomber have been addressed.\xc2\xa0 And some of the reasons why certain information was not shared, certain information didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it through the system, we have taken steps to ensure that that type of problem does not happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So one of the things that President Obama has insisted that we do on each of these incidents is to take a look back and to see where the system worked well, where it fell down, what changes we could make, either in information technology or in business processes.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that those deficiencies we identified as a result of previous reviews are being addressed and that we are in a much better position today than we were last year at this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Monday, there were 12 individuals in the U.K. who were arrested on a suspected terrorist plot.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you can tell us anything more that we know about that or anything about their intention.\xc2\xa0 And also, if the problem of intelligence-sharing has been solved, if you could explain why Director of National Intelligence Clapper did not know at 3:45 p.m. on Monday about those arrests -- in an interview with Diane Sawyer that you and Secretary Napolitano did -- how that\'s possible that hours later he had not been told --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I would be pleased to address that question, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 I mean, even today, as you know, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me address your first question first, and I will defer to my British counterparts to provide information about the status of their investigation.\xc2\xa0 We are in constant contact with the British -- we were since the beginning of this takedown of the individuals in Britain -- to work with them closely to find out whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s any nexus here to the homeland, find out what we can about their motivations, intentions and where their operational planning was going.\xc2\xa0 So that is ongoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the second issue, Jim Clapper is, I think, the consummate DNI.\xc2\xa0 He was working on developments in the Korean Peninsula in terms of political and military developments.\xc2\xa0 He was focused on trying to provide support to the Congress as far as the START treaty deliberations were concerned.\xc2\xa0 He was engaged in a variety of classified matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should he have been briefed by his staff on those arrests?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I know there was breathless attention by the media about these arrests and it was constantly on the news networks.\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad that Jim Clapper is not sitting in front of the TV 24 hours a day and monitoring what\xe2\x80\x99s coming out of the media.\xc2\xa0 What he is doing is focusing on those intelligence issues that the President expects him to focus on, and to make sure that we don\'t have conflict in different parts of the world.\xc2\xa0 He continues to focus on those. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And his not being briefed yesterday afternoon -- this is something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that he should have been briefed on.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken steps to correct that now, and if that happens again I\'m sure that he is going to be au courant as far as a takedown overseas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- by implication, are you suggesting that the arrests, that the threat was not serious enough to have risen to that level --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 No, what I\'m suggesting is that there was the sharing of the information from the British to U.S. officials.\xc2\xa0 We were in touch with the British throughout the day and continue to be so.\xc2\xa0 There was no action that the DNI had to take; there was nothing that was required of him to do.\xc2\xa0 And so he was focused on those matters that required his direct and personal attention.\xc2\xa0 And he was giving full attention to those matters.\xc2\xa0 And the President was very appreciative that he was focused on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is going to be continued interaction with the British on this.\xc2\xa0 There may be things that the DNI personally will need to be involved in.\xc2\xa0 But as of that time, there was nothing that the DNI needed to do or to be engaged in that would have required him to set aside other pressing intelligence matters to get briefed on things that were being put out in the press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, John.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have a clarifying question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he say that there currently is no credible specific, imminent threat?\xc2\xa0 Is that what he said?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you -- we\'ll send around the transcript, which will have the answer I think to both Dan and the earlier questions.\xc2\xa0 And then I hope you guys all should have the paper, which will also come electronically, going through, as you heard John say, the corrective actions and the result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s asking for after-action reports on incidents and disruptions that have taken place over the course of more than a year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may, are folks going to see and feel more security during their holiday travel, and are you giving us this in part to give them a heads-up about that and give some explanation why --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, think you guys overblew that when we did it at Thanksgiving.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s sort of taken care of.\xc2\xa0 No, no, Wendell, I think we wanted to give a sense, I think importantly, of what has been done as a result of what John mentioned last year as a failure in our security and intelligence apparatus relating to the attempted bombing on Christmas Day. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the American people to understand that, as John said, we take the threat enormously seriously.\xc2\xa0 There is a huge part of our government that is focused on those threats and on their security.\xc2\xa0 And we wanted those to be aware of the steps that have been taken in the intervening weeks and months to address that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI do not anticipate that people will see or feel an increase in, or an inconvenience in their travel plans, but suffice to say we are taking all the necessary steps and measures across not just air travel, but other modes of transportation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I follow on that, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are the recently initiated searches of bags here in the D.C. Metro a part of this program, and we\'ll we expect to see that in other transit systems?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to talk about specifics.\xc2\xa0 Obviously John and others look at intelligence and reporting across, as I said, many different modes of transportation and many different\xc2\xa0 -- are aware of and acting on information across a broad spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is, to my knowledge, this is the first instance right after 9/11 there have been searches of bags in public transit systems, and it\xe2\x80\x99s happening at this holiday, right at this time, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are going to take whatever steps and actions are necessary to ensure a heightened sense of protection.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- maybe my recollection is wrong, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true, aside from the underwear bombing attempt last Christmas Day, we in Washington and official Washington and the media get breathless each holiday time about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that your breathlessness is reserved simply to holidays observed on a calendar.\xc2\xa0 But, no, again --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My point is that these are -- that the attempts and attacks have been random it seems --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that John would probably tell you there\xe2\x80\x99s, quite frankly, a little bit of both.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously you have around the holiday season, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Thanksgiving or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s around Christmas, you have a huge increase in just the volume of those that are moving around.\xc2\xa0 You have, as you mentioned, at other times -- Times Square or the AQAP plot involving cargo planes, which is not -- as you mentioned, not affixed necessarily to a holiday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why -- I think one of the points that John wanted to make was, regardless of the day on the calendar, there\xe2\x80\x99s a vigilance that must be maintained around the clock in order to ensure that we are doing all that we possibly can, and taking the steps that are necessary to rightly protect the American people and to inform them of threats that might be had outside of the homeland.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, this was largely an informational briefing on John\xe2\x80\x99s part to give you a sense of what we\'re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up question about the signing ceremony for "don\'t ask, don\'t tell."\xc2\xa0 I was struck by the President saying at the top that he was overwhelmed.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there was a lot of emotion to that ceremony.\xc2\xa0 Can you offer some context, having been with him for many years -- is that one of the more emotional times you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him in that kind of setting? Did it stand out to you that way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think watching it on television as well as -- I was not there; I wish I would have been -- but I think this is something that the President has fought long and hard for and believed needed to be done -- has needed to be done for many years.\xc2\xa0 Again, when I started working for him in April of 2004, and as part of his campaign for the U.S. Senate, he had pledged to vote for the repeal of this policy because he thought it was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 I think today represents the beginning of a process that ends that policy.\xc2\xa0 The President had occasion to speak with Admiral Mullen and several of the Joint Chiefs yesterday to discuss what is now being implemented in terms of a working group to -- that will lead to the certification by the Secretary of Defense, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs and the President that the policy is officially ended.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s belief, in discussing with the chiefs is that this is a matter of months.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to that happening.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do think it was -- I do think this was one of -- this is an accomplishment that he\xe2\x80\x99s enormously proud of and happy that it was one that was not just the work of one party but by those across party lines that believed that the policy was wrong, didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense for our national security, and is now in the process of being ended.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other on that.\xc2\xa0 Do you -- some of the advocates who have fought for this for so long see this as an opening of greater justice for their cause.\xc2\xa0 Do you see that as well?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see this as the country is ready for more equality on this front?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think whether you look at the attitudinal study that was done at the Pentagon or you look at any assortment of public polling conducted by many of your news organizations, I think it is clear to see that the attitudes of Americans about who should or who could serve in the military has clearly changed over the course of the past several years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What that leads to in the future I think is harder to tell because some of this stuff obviously has to go through a divided Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 One, on START, Harry Reid said he expected that it would be ratified by 2:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk any more about how many calls the President has made specifically --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that when the bill is -- when the treaty is ratified.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 South Korea today announced that they were going to be doing a large military operation.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House thinking in terms of whether it might provoke a response from North Korea, what South Korea is doing --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and if that could lead to any escalation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, our belief is that obviously the exercises have been well publicized.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re well advanced -- announced well in advance.\xc2\xa0 Everybody I think in the world is aware that they\xe2\x80\x99re happening.\xc2\xa0 And they are exercises that are defensive in nature.\xc2\xa0 The United States is obviously supportive of the Republic of Korea.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just given the climate lately with Pyongyang and the bombing of the island, is there concern that there might be more of an escalation?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there anything --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think exercises that have been announced well in advance, that are transparent, that are defensive in nature, should in no way engender a response from the North Koreans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the fundamental principle underlying the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d is important?\xc2\xa0 Is it national security?\xc2\xa0 Is it equality?\xc2\xa0 Is it both?\xc2\xa0 Is there something else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all of that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believed it was unjust and I think it -- believed that we had a number of brave men and women that were willing to sign up for their country, willing to serve their country, and willing to die for their country.\xc2\xa0 And I think the story that the President opened his remarks with today was one that was quite moving.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is glad to see this day come on the grounds of both greater equality and an enhancement of our national security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it any less unjust that those same brave troops can\xe2\x80\x99t get married to somebody of the same sex?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what -- not the bill we were signing today, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but if that principle is important to the President, about those brave troops being able to have equality, should they have marriage equality also?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to his remarks on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His remarks are that he thinks that marriage is between a man and a woman.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that he supports -- strongly supports civil unions and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the military doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize civil unions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me what the military recognized.\xc2\xa0 You asked me what the President believed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just to pinpoint it here, it\xe2\x80\x99s unjust to not let them serve --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, to pinpoint it here, I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to make news on that issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to point out the fact that this principle seems to have a border in a way -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to everything.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to point out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one question about Israel?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any consequence at all for the Israeli government constantly disagreeing with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on housing settlements, or is there not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed many times in this room, Jake, we have -- our government has had a position that dates back I think probably to the administration of Lyndon Johnson about our views on housing.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to make our position known, again, as we have for many administrations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat does not stop our efforts to remain engaged in a comprehensive peace process.\xc2\xa0 We understand as a country what happens -- or I should say, we understand as the world what happens when our country is not engaged and involved in the process of actively working with each side to bring about a comprehensive peace.\xc2\xa0 That is a long and bumpy road, but the President will continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the same basic idea at play with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, that we continue to engage with them even if they do things we don\xe2\x80\x99t like that are at -- that harm what we perceive to be our national interest?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Meaning what?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The ISI and its reluctance to -- as the AfPak report said, that there\xe2\x80\x99s still safe havens and yet we still --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to address the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you were trying to link a series of those things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have important bilateral relationships where we agree and we disagree within those relationships.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a timeframe as to when the policy will be certified?\xc2\xa0 I know the President said he wants this to happen without delay but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President discussed with Mullen and others yesterday the fact that I think as a group they believe this is a timeframe that is a matter of months.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But nothing more specific than that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more specific than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is the President going to do to make sure that it stays within this matter of months timeframe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, he had an interest in discussing with the chiefs and with the chair, and I would point out both Gates and Mullen played a big role in seeing this day happen.\xc2\xa0 And to watch the testimony of the Chair of the Joint Chiefs say that this is a policy that should be changed was a historic moment.\xc2\xa0 Now they have -- they are charged with the job of implementing this change and their commitment to the President is that it can be done in a very timely manner. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- or there\xe2\x80\x99s been conjecture about when that would happen.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President was very clear that this is not something that needs to or should drag on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple housekeeping matters.\xc2\xa0 Anything more on whether we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President today and when is he leaving?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you can tell me when Congress leaves, I can answer all of the above questions.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate at some point you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President today.\xc2\xa0 I should start a pool as to when that would be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what time we\xe2\x80\x99d like it to happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you, if -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do it now and then we can go about Christmas shopping and doing whatever things we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to do as a result of this.\xc2\xa0 Regrettably, Dan, you and I have -- we hold very few cards in this long process.\xc2\xa0 But I anticipate that you will at some point see him. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say as a pure housekeeping measure, we are not likely to have a ton of time in terms of when you see the advisory.\xc2\xa0 So to help out Caroline and others, when you see the advisory please RSVP.\xc2\xa0 If there are people that need to come into this building that aren\xe2\x80\x99t here on a regular basis, they are going to have a very, very limited time with which to do that.\xc2\xa0 Please tell your organizations and give them that heads-up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there will be a news conference, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of when?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my hope.\xc2\xa0 Again, Ben --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 News conference or a statement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A news conference.\xc2\xa0 But again, Ben, I got out of the prognosticating business around health care.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President and you and others in the administration have made it pretty clear that even though the DREAM Act failed to pass you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to pursue it in the next Congress; that you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to pursue other goals like tax reform -- even though the deck is stacked much more heavily against you.\xc2\xa0 Is there --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is -- somewhere in there is presumably the punctuation of a question mark, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you find it amusing.\xc2\xa0 Well, my question is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how do you propose to do these things when it was hard enough to do what you were able to do, if not almost impossible, when the odds are stacked further against you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How much would you have bet me that we would get that all that we\xe2\x80\x99re about to get done, done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No problem, but -- (laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, somebody please begin -- hit record on my VCR so I can save this tape. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 VCR?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking to Bill.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Merry Christmas.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s tough. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why should this time be different from any other time?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, look, I think the President will have an opportunity to discuss what has been accomplished over the past six weeks, the path for how we can work together and accomplish stuff that\'s in the national interest next year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 But, Bill, I guess I\'d start with your question -- no pun intended -- in noting that I doubt many people would have thought that we\xe2\x80\x99d have a free trade agreement that enjoys the support of the Chamber of Commerce and the United Auto Workers; huge bipartisan majorities supporting a tax agreement that allows unemployment benefits to last throughout all of next year, provides certainty in tax rates that won\'t rise for middle-class families; that we have begun the repeal of "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" through a congressional process; and -- knock on wood -- let me finish, let me finish -- the likely ratification of a START agreement whose obituary has been written more times than I could care to remember.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 None of that was easy, and none of what has to happen going forward is easy.\xc2\xa0 But I know the President believes that there are -- and I think those milestones that I just mentioned -- I think what they show the President is that when people get together and understand and believe what is in the best interest of the American people -- certainty in tax rates, repeal of policies that people believe are unjust, or something that protects our national security -- that we have far more in common than we do in opposition, and that working together we can get things done.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what animated him to run for public office. That\'s what animated him to run for President.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what animated his actions over the past six weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s all good for you, but what incentive do Republicans have to cooperate with him in the next Congress?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an election coming in two years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And four and six and eight.\xc2\xa0 But, Bill, they --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will they remember these things?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll write them down.\xc2\xa0 They also -- they control part of government.\xc2\xa0 A budget is going to originate in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 Funding bills are going to originate in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the incentive that they have is less of an incentive and more of a responsibility.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re charged with having to run half of the legislative branch. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 I think -- as I said yesterday, I think that has kicked in over -- I think that responsibility has kicked in to some degree a bit early, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all of what I just mentioned happen -- obviously a free trade agreement has not yet gone through Congress but you saw bipartisan support for that free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 And you saw each of the things that I mentioned that went through Congress legislatively done not by the votes of simply one party but by the votes of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is a path that the President thinks won\'t be easy to follow but provides a path for how we can get things done that are in the interest of the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 That\'s what that election was about.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, the election was not about how do we grind this place more to a halt, how do we play more political games.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about how do we get things done that the American people understand are in the best interests of the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll play back the 8-track tape in six months.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thought you were still on reel-to-reel, Bill, but that\'s an upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooooh --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You never groan when he makes fun of me.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I get it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has ordered changes in the treatment of prisoners at Gitmo who can\'t be brought to trial, or at least can\'t be brought to trial now -- can you talk about those --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, start again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has ordered some changes in the treatment, the rights, if you will, of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay who can\'t be brought to trial --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about the draft executive order?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Basically, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But let me change the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re right, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not finalized yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go farther than that.\xc2\xa0 That is a process\xc2\xa0 -- that is a document that has not even begun the process of a deputies committee meeting.\xc2\xa0 It has not been read, looked at or reviewed by the President.\xc2\xa0 I do not think it is -- or it should be surprising to many, off of the speech that he gave in May of 2009, that there are going to be those that are currently in Guantanamo Bay that, for whatever reason, are not going to be able to be tried in either a federal court or in a military commission, that are going to have to be indefinitely detained.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 The President was clear on that in May.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\'t -- I have no comment on the draft executive order, largely because it is a long way from ever even reaching the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if that process is intended to make the facility in Guantanamo Bay somewhat more acceptable to the President.\xc2\xa0 He has said it\xe2\x80\x99s a recruitment tool, but you can\'t seem to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, not to mess with the premise of your question, but he has said that because al Qaeda has used it as such. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They have used it as a recruitment tool, and our generals and our commanders see them using it as a recruitment tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously the President is -- again, I\'d refer you to the speech in May of 2009 that seeks to do -- well, I\'d say broadly, the President does not believe that our national security and the protection of our homeland has to be in contradiction with our values as Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what animates him in this entire process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the draft order is in no way connected with having to basically live with Guantanamo Bay because --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I want to divorce this answer from, again, from the draft executive order because it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0 -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a process that has certainly not worked its way through even to the deputies committee procedure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0But I think, as the President said -- I don\'t think anybody would find it surprising that the President and this administration understand that there are those that have been evaluated by our intelligence community, by our defense infrastructure, and we understand, as the President does, that there are some that will require indefinite detention.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me finally say the President is still committed to closing Guantanamo Bay --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- when is it going to happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to when it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 I know that remains the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me make one other quick announcement.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the timing on this -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and try to find it -- but the President did sign the continuing resolution that funds government through early March this morning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and try to find the time.\xc2\xa0 I just -- can you email somebody on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously it looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re peeling off significant numbers of Republicans on the START treaty vote.\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell has said that his priority is to stop the President from being reelected.\xc2\xa0 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s losing apparent control of his own caucus, at least on this.\xc2\xa0 Is this a one-off, or is this a pattern moving forward?\xc2\xa0 Do you really need to negotiate with him in the next Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think that -- I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to, and we will, work with Republican leaders in Congress more closely than we have in the past couple of years.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, they have a responsibility to the governing of this country unlike they have had in the previous two years.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think what -- I think the result of what has happened over the past few weeks is not -- is less somebody losing control of their caucus and more those in that caucus understanding that the message is work together and get things done; don\xe2\x80\x99t relitigate the fights of yesterday.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time before that next election; focus not on your political future but on our future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the message that the American people are sending and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the message that those in Congress have heard in everything, again, from the tax agreement to the hopeful ratification of the START treaty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you -- did Mitch McConnell not get that message when he said he was going to try and defeat the President in the next election?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that is a broad and fundamental misreading of what the election was about.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that, regardless of your vote, people went to the polls thinking let\xe2\x80\x99s extend gridlock and political gamesmanship for another two years.\xc2\xa0 I just -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s what some up there believe, then have it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s where the American people are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow on that briefly?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 By the way, I like the tie.\xc2\xa0 It must be an important day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I just want to get out of here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSenator McConnell went on the Sunday shows saying that he was opposed to START.\xc2\xa0 His folks said that that was to sort of halt the momentum for this.\xc2\xa0 He also got a bit brushed back on the earmarks thing from his own conference.\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of made a miscalculation here in taking too hard a line to appease these Tea Party types?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that -- I think on a number of -- I think certainly on the issue of START, he miscalculated that there are those that believe, as the President does, that we can put aside partisan political interests to do something that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our national security.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the treaty will be ratified today.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- again, I think people want us to put aside the way Washington has traditionally worked and worked together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the days of sort of \xe2\x80\x9cFortress McConnell,\xe2\x80\x9d him holding the 40 people -- the 40 members of his conference more or less intact, are essentially over --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that there are going to be times in which -- look, you see it on the 9/11 bill.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s 58 on one side; there\xe2\x80\x99s 42 on the other.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that might change if that were something that was considered next year or not.\xc2\xa0 But I still think as the -- and I think the President believes that there will be times in which we will have splits along partisan lines because we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting about something that we all hold deeply.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think those days are gone.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason we have two parties.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, I think the President believes that on a whole host of issues -- national security, middle-class tax cuts, and things like that -- that there ought to be -- we ought to be able to put aside some of those differences to get what we agree on done for the American people.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the message of the last several weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on his follow-up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll come around.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the signing ceremony this morning, the President very pointedly thanked Nancy Pelosi and thanked Harry Reid and talked about the productivity of the first two years.\xc2\xa0 First, is that -- do you think that was an appropriate thing to be doing at a signing ceremony on a landmark civil rights bill?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that -- was that a victory lap of sorts?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This was a victory for everybody that was in that room and for many that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in that room.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- this was something that a lot of people, men and women, those in Congress and out of Congress, those in the military, those out of the military, that have fought a long time for.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything inappropriate for the President to discuss what he believes is and has been a very productive two years in Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that was a reference not to \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it was a reference to \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d plus financial reform, health care reform, economic recovery, credit card reform -- a whole host of things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that a theme that you expect him to take up this afternoon?\xc2\xa0 Is that the point of --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate he might dip his toe in that water, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say the Joint Chiefs were here yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, he spoke with them on the phone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The guys at OMB.\xc2\xa0 I have called my bank to ensure that did not -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 got one of them on the phone if you need them to vouch for an impending direct deposit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said 9:50 a.m.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At 9:50 a.m., yes.\xc2\xa0 It would have been I guess fairly close to him getting back from the signing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll find out on food safety.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 And moving away from hard news for a second, can you just give us a snapshot of what the President is looking forward to in Hawaii -- golf, books?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rain?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is -- I think he is, as much as anything, anxious to spend time where he grew up with his family and to see his sister, to see his niece -- nieces, I should say.\xc2\xa0 I should get a rundown of which childhood friends. Normally a bunch of them usually come back and it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President to spend some time with them.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s most looking forward to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related to that, will he be looking at the -- will there be a staff review that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at while he\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xc2\xa0 And also will he be looking at the State of the Union address at all, or will he be working on that at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take a number of things with him and that he\xe2\x80\x99ll read a good amount of stuff.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have, obviously, his daily intelligence briefing as well as probably a novel or two.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned education yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is he giving speeches on that after the election -- or, I mean, after December, early next year -- his views on education reform and that kind of issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to remember through -- I would anticipate that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen until post-State of the Union.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two quick things on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware -- last night, apparently Senate Republicans were working to insert some kind of amendment to the defense authorization bill to require the service chiefs to sign off.\xc2\xa0 Were you guys on the phone late last night to try to dissuade?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I think that would have required unanimous consent.\xc2\xa0 And given the lift to get the repeal done after 17 years, I don\'t think that Senator Reid had that in mind.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that -- this has been true since the President told the chiefs and told Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen that his goals was to see this policy repealed -- not if, but when.\xc2\xa0 That was in one of the very first meetings that was had about this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously implementation is enormously important to him. That\'s why he reached out yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that regardless of where any individual has been in representing the views of themselves or representing as part of the Joint Chiefs some views of their branch of the military, all told the President before repeal was voted and all have said since that they will implement the law of the land.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the -- I think that\'s what -- certainly, that\'s what the courts would expect.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s clearly what the American people and the Commander-in-Chief expects.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why, again, I believe he thinks, based on those discussions, that this can be done in a matter of months.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other thing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House invite any other congressional Republicans from the House or Senate, other than those who came this morning, to the signing ceremony?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would have to -- let me check with legislative affairs and see if there was -- who might have been invited and didn\'t come.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there anyone --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, as you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some complaints from some members of the New York congressional delegation -- Carolyn Maloney and others -- that the White House has not taken an active enough role in the 9/11 responders bill.\xc2\xa0 Apparently that\'s changed a bit over the last 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 Can you sort of detail for me what the latest --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see what has -- I mean, again, we have been -- we came out for this bill in August.\xc2\xa0 We detailed those views both publicly and in statements of administration policy to the House when they voted, and to the Senate when they voted.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say for the past more than a week or so that we were strongly supportive of this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody in our party left to convince.\xc2\xa0 They\'re all there.\xc2\xa0 They\'re all there.\xc2\xa0 And I hope that, and the President hopes that when this bill is likely brought up for its reconsideration today that there are those on the Republican side that do just that and reconsider.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been contacting people about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with Legislative Affairs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two brief questions.\xc2\xa0 First, there will be a formal ceremony next year for the promulgation of the START treaty with the President and President Medvedev, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Medvedev -- I don\'t know what the schedule is.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that -- as I understand it, the treaty is ratified once the Senate does it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of, at least right now, plans to do a ceremony that you speak of.\xc2\xa0 I think that we had the signing, obviously, of the treaty last April-ish in Prague.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 The other thing, Robert, is that you this week gave a lot of credit to three secretaries of state in Republican administrations for securing --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And likely, I\xe2\x80\x99ve left out dozens of people that have been helpful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned yesterday Admiral Mullen and General \xe2\x80\x9cHoss\xe2\x80\x9d Cartwright, appointees of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration count on more identifiably Republican figures and figures from past administration in the next Congress to win --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that, as is true on a number of issues, not just on issues of national security, that there are those that share an interest in different policies.\xc2\xa0 And when they can -- when the President talks to them, or the Vice President talks to them, or people in the administration talk to them, and they desire to be helpful, we think it is always helpful to have Democrats and Republicans -- those that are currently serving and those that have served our country -- out to discuss why they think this is an important priority for the American people.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly done that in the past, and I hope to continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to just follow up on your answer to Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question about indefinite detentions.\xc2\xa0 You said that the order is \xe2\x80\x9ca long way from reaching the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I think in at least one of those leaked stories yesterday, there was an intimation that it would be some time in January, so -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to confirm --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just say this, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know the process at this point because, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not one step away from the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s many, many meetings.\xc2\xa0 And again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been brought to him.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s at I think a deputies committee level.\xc2\xa0 At some point in the next few days, that would likely lead to a series of things before a principals committee that -- a principals\xe2\x80\x99 level, which would include the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen before the end of the year is clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Certainly not, no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe not even in January?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to give a timeline.\xc2\xa0 Definitely not by the end of the year since that\'s rapidly approaching.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just so that I understand the planning purposes for today, is the President poised to do the press conference after the START vote or after they gavel out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To be determined.\xc2\xa0 Again, our hope is to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be coy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in more scheduling meetings about this than I would care to recount.\xc2\xa0 And every time you go through a scenario and people leave, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new set of times.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our hope would be that we could do something sort of mid to late afternoon, which would allow for some normal deadlines for you guys. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where?\xc2\xa0 Here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, that is -- I think we would likely do it over in the auditorium on the first floor of EEOB.\xc2\xa0 So, again, my -- I\xe2\x80\x99m out here to tell you on behalf of Caroline and others -- Marissa and folks -- when you do see that advisory, do just take a second and RSVP or have your organizations RSVP so that the process can be rather smooth.\xc2\xa0 There will be a very tight timeline, as I said, to get people that are not pass-holders in the building in.\xc2\xa0 And those are not our deadlines, as much as they are Secret Service deadlines.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people coming through the White House for tours, so please be attentive to that as you can.\xc2\xa0 And we will try to give you guys as much notice as we can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For wheels up, is he committed to staying until they gavel out?\xc2\xa0 Or until he gets the stuff he was babysitting until it concluded?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My understanding until they\'re reasonably done.\xc2\xa0 So again -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Please stay in touch, again, as to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It will be dark.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I should have just started with that and seen if that worked, and I will associate myself with that answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on those housekeeping questions -- do you have a vision for bill signings beyond --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t yet.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to check on food safety.\xc2\xa0 And we will try to keep you up to date throughout the day pending additional needs for bill signers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he try to do START before he leaves?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think he has to sign it because it\xe2\x80\x99s -- once it\xe2\x80\x99s ratified.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then 9/11 health care would probably be the only thing, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We hope that passes, and we hope that that\'s something that can be signed into law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned about the escalating price of oil, which appears to be going up beyond the cold-weather premium?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, anything that has the potential to impact our economy, we watch, and we are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Energy would instruct me not to speak specifically about those prices, and I would point you over to them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Besides outlining the accomplishments for this year, would the President put Congress on notice about those that he anticipates they will try to repeal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In today\xe2\x80\x99s remarks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember off the top of my head.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s -- let me check, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get back to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Middle East peace process has been one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s main foreign policy priorities, but it has been stalled for some time.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to make any calls to Mr. Abbas or Mr. Netanyahu before the end of the year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m currently aware of, but we will double-check.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Gitmo -- you said there are those who can\xe2\x80\x99t be tried for whatever reason.\xc2\xa0 Could you spell out those reasons beyond just the intelligence community says so?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think obviously some of that has to do with whether or not, because of torture, evidence can\xe2\x80\x99t be used.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was water-boarded, and Attorney General Holder says that he can still face trial, what else happened that we maybe don\'t know about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what happened has been fairly extensively covered in documents that were released last year on the topic.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what else -- what\xe2\x80\x99s a review going to do?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to change the fact that they were tortured?\xc2\xa0 I mean can you try them?\xc2\xa0 If you review it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change the fact that they were tortured.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of a review?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On reviewing their detention status.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change the basic facts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have reviewed their -- we reviewed every -- we review the status of every person\xe2\x80\x99s detention as a result of our taking occupation of this administration.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed here before, a number of -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like that there was sufficient information on a whole host of detainees.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have had to -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that went through to determine the status of each detainee and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also obviously had to balance decisions on habeas petitions that have been ruled on by the courts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you foresee the next two years of Congress being more productive, considering the President said today that the last two years were very productive and you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that Republicans seem to have taken a earlier responsibility to governing -- so do you foresee the next --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I do not think that the next two years, because there is a divided House and Senate on different party lines, that the next Congress has to be by definition unproductive.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and our belief and our hope is that, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past many weeks, that people have made determinations on issues that are important to them and important to the national security of this country, and have acted not as simply agents of one party or another but as lawmakers and Americans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd our hope is that that is an atmosphere that we can continue to foster and that will lead to a host of things that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President discuss at the beginning of the year and throughout the State of the Union that are important to us continuing our economic recovery, protecting our citizens, and ensuring that we are competitive with the entire world in the 21st century.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
