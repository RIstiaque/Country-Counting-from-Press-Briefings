Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:58 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as almost every day is, a busy day for news and events.\xc2\xa0 Before I go to your questions I just wanted to mention that in addition to the Senate Democrats and then the House Republicans -- or a subsection of the House Republicans, although all of them were invited -- being here this afternoon, Senate Republicans will pay a visit to the White House to meet with the President tomorrow morning.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have a specific time for you later.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, I don\'t have an announcement to make.\xc2\xa0 I suspect I know at least some of the questions you\xe2\x80\x99ll ask, so I\'ll go straight to the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I think we all want to know what the White House reaction is to the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s proposal this morning.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House, that there at least seems to be a recognition that default is not an option.\xc2\xa0 Now, the President believes that it would be far better for the Congress -- and in this case, the House -- to raise the debt ceiling for an extended period of time, as Senate Democrats are working on as we speak.\xc2\xa0 It would be far better for the economy if we stopped this episodic brinksmanship and sort of moth-balled the so-called nuclear weapon here, which is the threat of default, for a longer duration.</p>\n<p>But it is certainly at least an encouraging sign that, based on today\xe2\x80\x99s statement by the Speaker, they\xe2\x80\x99re not listening to the debt limit and default deniers who seem to suggest, against all the accumulated wisdom of financial experts, that somehow it would be okay for the United States to enter territory that it had never entered before and threaten default for the first time in our history.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s our initial response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President sign a short-term --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen nothing -- obviously no proposal from House Republicans yet.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no bill to look at. As I just said, the President strongly prefers a longer-term resolution so that we can get away from this periodic brinksmanship.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition that we can\'t default, why is there an insistence or the implication that you keep the nuclear weapon in your back pocket to threaten default in the near term?\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense to us.</p>\n<p>Having said that, we\'ll see what the House Republicans propose.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see what they\xe2\x80\x99re able to pass and consider it then.\xc2\xa0 The President said the other day that, in the hypothetical, he would be willing to do this because he thinks that we need to avoid default.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not -- he\xe2\x80\x99s been very clear.\xc2\xa0 He will not pay ransom in exchange for the Republicans in the House doing their job -- pay ransom to the tea party Republicans to allow Congress to do its job, which is to fund the government and ensure that we do not default.\xc2\xa0 And that position has been steady and clear throughout this period.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would not that same argument apply during a short-term extension of the debt ceiling where the President agrees to hold negotiations over the budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you keep adding things that we don\'t know -- we haven\'t seen a bill yet.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen what the House -- what the Speaker is going to put forward.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know what he could pass.</p>\n<p>Now, what the Speaker said today is that he thinks there ought to be negotiations, and what the other leaders said is that there ought to be negotiations over our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 The President has been saying that all year long.\xc2\xa0 House Republicans rejected on 19 different occasions the opportunity to appoint conferees to match the Senate conferees so that they could try to reconcile the two budgets they passed.</p>\n<p>But why would it be the right thing to do to keep punishing the American people in order to talk about our budget priorities? That\'s what they\'re doing by keeping the government shut down.\xc2\xa0 Why would it be the right thing to do to do continued harm to the American economy?\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t hear a rationale for why that is acceptable or okay, and I don\'t think any of you did either.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Must the condition of extending the debt ceiling also include reopening the government?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said very clearly --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 What is your position?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to react to Boehner.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking if you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along that they should turn on the lights and open the government.\xc2\xa0 They should raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 They should do both.\xc2\xa0 So if they -- I think the President said the other day that if they were to send him a clean debt ceiling extension, no partisan strings attached, he would sign it.\xc2\xa0 But we don\'t know that that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get here.\xc2\xa0 If they send him a -- if the House passes, as they could right now, the bill that passed the Senate to reopen the government at funding levels Republicans set and celebrated, he would sign it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is -- we got into this mess because tea party Republicans were insisting that they could use the shutdown of the government and the threat of default to defund Obamacare, or delay Obamacare, basically prevent millions of Americans from getting access to affordable insurance.\xc2\xa0 It was a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand.\xc2\xa0 And the people who are paying the price are the hardworking Americans across this country who suffer when the government is shut down, and who would suffer mightily if Republicans who seem to think default is a game get their way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, I think we have up here -- these are the elected representatives sent to Washington to fulfill their responsibilities as members of Congress:\xc2\xa0 Representative Ted Yoho just yesterday said, \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone needs to convince me why we need to raise the debt ceiling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Warren Buffett, who knows a thing or two about the financial markets and the economy, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt should be like a nuclear bomb, basically too horrible to use.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The head of PIMCO, the CEO says, \xe2\x80\x9cDefault would be a tragedy for America.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Senator Richard Burr, Republican senator, says, \xe2\x80\x9cDefault is manageable for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The experts -- Macroeconomic Advisers says, \xe2\x80\x9cDefault would lead to 14 percent unemployment and the worst recession since World War II.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>RBC Capital Markets says, \xe2\x80\x9cCrossing the debt ceiling would be catastrophic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Senator Rand Paul, Republican, says, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\'t raise the debt ceiling, we balance the budget.\xc2\xa0 The world is going to end?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Well, Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Fed, says, \xe2\x80\x9cDefault would be very, very costly to our economy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Martin Feldstein, Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s CEA chair, says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe debt ceiling is a very dangerous thing to play with.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So these are the voices that have been driving this crisis, and it should end.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that there\xe2\x80\x99s an implication in what we heard from House Republican leaders today that they are coming to see the light, that we need to end this crisis -- this manufactured crisis -- that would be a good thing.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pay ransom to the tea party so that Congress can do its job remains what it was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obamacare has not been part of the demand -- are you saying, then the President can negotiate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how you could have reached that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to pay ransom.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that this is how we got here.\xc2\xa0 This is the logic that led to the shutdown of the government, and the logic that has led to us getting perilously close to the point beyond which the Treasury can no longer use borrowing authority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a rational approach to be taken by leaders in Congress towards these very serious challenges -- because they\'re -- as the President said all along, we should sit down and work out our differences, find common ground on our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 The President has been meeting with Republicans, talking to Republicans all year long in search of that compromise.\xc2\xa0 And we should put everything on the table, and the President has made that clear.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s exemplified in the budget proposal he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.</p>\n<p>But what we cannot do is continue to punish the American people, which is what tea party Republicans are doing, in the name of trying to extract partisan demands that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get through the normal legislative process.\xc2\xa0 And whether that\'s an attempt to defund or repeal or delay the Affordable Care Act, or any other partisan demand -- maybe tax breaks for millionaires, or anything else they could attach for it -- who benefits from that approach?\xc2\xa0 The American people don\'t benefit, and the economy doesn\'t benefit.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has taken the position that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you have Republicans coming to the White House this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly said the administration isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to negotiate over the debt ceiling or the government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 But Republicans now say they have made this suggestion, this offer of a short-term increase in the debt limit and that if the President rejects that offer we\'re back to square one.\xc2\xa0 What do you expect from today\'s meeting, if not some kind of discussion about where to go next?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has always said that he is willing to talk about anything.\xc2\xa0 What he will not do is pay a ransom, negotiate over their demands in exchange for Congress doing its fundamental job -- paying our bills, funding our government.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, he looks forward to having a subset of House Republicans here.\xc2\xa0 Our view -- and the reason why we invited all members of Congress to these meetings is that it\'s often the case that he or others meet with leaders of the House and then find out that the decisions are being driven by other members of the House.\xc2\xa0 So it might have been useful to hear from some of those other members and for them to hear from him.</p>\n<p>Be that as it may, he looks forward to the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to hearing more from the Speaker and the other leaders about this proposal that they talked about today.\xc2\xa0 What we haven\'t seen yet is a bill.\xc2\xa0 What we haven\'t seen yet is whether or not any bill that they would write could pass.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll look forward to having that discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The principle remains throughout, which is the American people should not be punished so that Republican leaders can save face.\xc2\xa0 The American people should not see their economy harmed, and economic growth slowed and job creation slowed and interest rates spiked, because the tea party insists on getting what it could not get through normal legislative means or through the ballot box.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you expressed disappointment that not all the members of the Republican caucus were coming to the White House today.\xc2\xa0 What do you lose from them not being here?\xc2\xa0 Were you hoping to see divisions in the Republican Party?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it say about your relationship with Speaker Boehner?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I just was saying, I think that we -- the President invited all members of Congress because he believes that all of them shoulder the responsibility invested in them when they were sworn into office to uphold their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And that includes making sure the government is open and functioning and funded, and making sure that the United States continues to pay its bills on time and maintains its full faith and credit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes specifically to the House of Representatives and the House Republican conference, I think the President extended the invitation to all members because we have seen that it is a very diverse and fractious conference and that discussions with the leaders have not always -- well, it has become apparent -- and I think many of your colleagues and you yourselves have reported on it -- that a subsection of the House Republican conference has been driving decision-making by the House Republican leadership at least for the past several weeks, and that is in part why we have a shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Speaker of the House took an approach to the funding of the government and passing a CR that was acceptable, even though it was Republican spending levels, acceptable to the Democratic leader in the Senate, acceptable to the Democratic leader in the House.\xc2\xa0 And he had to abandon that approach -- or he chose to abandon that approach under pressure from the tea party.\xc2\xa0 So, in our view, it would have been useful to hear from them as well and to speak to them as well, directly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if a short-term debt ceiling bill comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk and it does not carry with it a continuing resolution to reopen the government, the President would at the very least sign that bill -- even though you haven\'t seen it -- clean debt ceiling bill to raise the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt limit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think, as I stated at the top, the President believes that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition that we cannot default, that we must ensure that we can continue to pay our bills and therefore the Congress must raise the debt ceiling that they ought to do it for longer than a few weeks.\xc2\xa0 But if a clean debt limit bill is passed he would likely sign it.\xc2\xa0 Again, we would have to see it.\xc2\xa0 We\'re speaking about a bill that does not at this point exist and it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all clear, based on what the Speaker said, that that\'s what we\'re going to see.</p>\n<p>The point is they don\'t get anything in exchange for holding the economy hostage.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t get anything in exchange for doing continued harm to the American people.\xc2\xa0 They ought to -- and they could -- the meeting would go very well indeed if prior to arriving here the House Republicans put on the floor the continuing resolution already passed by the Senate, passed it in the House, and then we would know that the government can reopen and that all the various problems caused by the shutdown could end today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that you might not get everything that you want here --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not asking for anything.\xc2\xa0 We\'re just asking for the government to be open at spending levels set by Republicans, and for Congress -- at the behest of the tea party -- not to default on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 full faith and credit for the first time in history.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not -- we\'re not asking for concessions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just asking for Congress to be responsible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my point is, is that all you may be able to get right now is the clean debt ceiling increase for the time being.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is the President has always said he would sign a clean debt limit increase.\xc2\xa0 It is far preferable that it be longer.\xc2\xa0 And what I said yesterday holds true today -- short term, medium term, long term, it will always be the case when it is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility, again, to ensure that our bills be paid, that he will not pay a ransom, that he will not allow the tea party to hold the American people hostage in exchange for doing its job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we may have a scenario where the debt ceiling is raised, default is averted, but we may still be in the position of having a government shutdown that is ongoing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if that were to happen, what would the Republican rationale for that be -- he continued punishment of the American people and the continued harm that that would do to the American economy?\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Just open the government at levels set by the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And then let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 Then let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about solving these issues for the longer term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could take it one chunk at a time, you could take one bite at a time, then?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear in answering the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I ask a very straightforward --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you, Jim.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Jon -- straightforward, I\xe2\x80\x99m all for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Straightforward.\xc2\xa0 Is the President willing to engage in budget negotiations with the Republicans if the government is still shut down?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very clear on that.\xc2\xa0 If the Republicans think, or the tea party that is driving the Republican decision-making up there thinks, that they can extract concessions by punishing the American people, by punishing the American economy in order to get what they want, the answer is no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is meeting with House Republicans today, so the idea that this is about having a conversation -- well, they\xe2\x80\x99re having a conversation today.\xc2\xa0 But they will not, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Obamacare, or tax breaks for millionaires, or any other of their possible demands -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get it in exchange for funding the government in a CR that was set by Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Remember, the whole point of a short-term CR, as proposed by the Speaker originally, basically a clean CR set at existing levels, was to allow for time to have budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the rationale for refusing to do that in order to have budget negotiations?\xc2\xa0 There is none.\xc2\xa0 The only -- it\xe2\x80\x99s spite.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate harm to average folks out there, some of whom are directly affected because they can\xe2\x80\x99t go to work; others who are affected because they can\xe2\x80\x99t get a business loan, or they can\xe2\x80\x99t get access to services that are important to them.\xc2\xa0 There is macroeconomic harm done the longer the government is shut down.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no logical rationale for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would say that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing harm to the American people, they\xe2\x80\x99re doing harm to the American economy, and by all accounts, they\xe2\x80\x99re doing harm to the Republican Party, which is bad for America.\xc2\xa0 We need two strong parties that can work together, and not be in a situation where one faction of one house of one branch of government is forcing shutdowns or default.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that was a very long answer to a yes-or-no question, and I just want to be sure I had it right.\xc2\xa0 The President will not engage in budget negotiations with the Republicans until the government is reopened -- is that his position?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position is clear.\xc2\xa0 They ought to turn on the lights, they ought to pay our bills.\xc2\xa0 The President has been ready all year long.\xc2\xa0 The fundamental question for Republicans is why is the price of negotiations the President has been willing to engage in all year long doing harm to the American people and doing harm to the American economy and threatening the global economy?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because the Republicans have proposed this six-month extension, because they -- sorry, six-week -- don\xe2\x80\x99t get excited\xc2\xa0 -- six-week extension -- (laughter) -- to give time for these budget negotiations they think will happen while the government remains shut down.\xc2\xa0 Are they deluding themselves?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just think about the proposition here, Jon.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to respond to what they --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But again, since we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen nothing from the Republicans yet beyond a very brief press conference, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to propose or what they may try to get passed in the House.\xc2\xa0 But the suggestion in your question is the Republicans would think that we can resolve all of our significant differences over the budget, and that while we work that out, we should do sustained harm to the American economy and sustained harm to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And their rationale for that would be what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To put pressure on you guys.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I love the crystallization here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right, they want to use harm -- I\xe2\x80\x99m obviously not suggesting that this is your view.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the logic here is that they would harm the American economy and the American people in order to try to extract concessions from the President and their counterparts on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an unsustainably bad proposition.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad economics.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad governance.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s bad politics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President would sign a clean -- truly clean six-week extension of the debt ceiling; he\xe2\x80\x99s going to need a clean CR before he will sit down and engage in negotiations on the long-term budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, to continue to talk about ifs and buts, as the Speaker said, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get us anywhere.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything from the House Republicans yet.\xc2\xa0 The President believes they ought to pay our bills.\xc2\xa0 The President believes they ought to turn on the lights.\xc2\xa0 And the President has always been willing to negotiate and work out and find common ground with Republicans over our long-term budget priorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he\xe2\x80\x99s not -- again, going back to, like, the assertion that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to use punishing the American people as leverage, doing harm to the American economy as leverage, that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable to the President and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s made that clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Republicans a negotiation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that they are calling it that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve called it a dialogue, a conversation.\xc2\xa0 The President is always willing to talk, have a dialogue.\xc2\xa0 What he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you call it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- is pay a ransom.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you call it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it depends on what you mean.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to give anything in return for Congress doing their job.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made that very clear.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pay ransom to the tea party so that the government opens or the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t default.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there are enormous stakes here when you think about the long-term implication of a willingness to do that, to let one faction of one party in one house of one branch of government threaten -- extract ideological demands of any President of either party in the future, and the harm that would do, the sustained damage that would do to the American people, to the middle class and to our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what comes of today\xe2\x80\x99s conversation?\xc2\xa0 What good does it do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s always useful, as is the case when the President has, on a number of occasions in recent days, for the President and the Speaker to talk, for the President and other members of the Republican Party in Congress to talk, and to hear directly from each other.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what will happen today.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what happened obviously with House Democrats yesterday.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what will happen with Senate Democrats today and Senate Republicans tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But he will make clear his view that it is a fundamental responsibility of Congress to fund the government and ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t default for the first time in our history.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what has to happen before there can be any negotiation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about throughout this process, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the Congress needs to do its job -- turn on the lights; stop threatening default; pay our bills.\xc2\xa0 And the President, all year long -- he\xe2\x80\x99s bought them dinner, he\xe2\x80\x99s had coffees, he\xe2\x80\x99s had meetings, he\xe2\x80\x99s had phone conversations, and has sincerely engaged -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not just been talk for him --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe he needs to up the ante.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there\'s a subsection here that would only raise the debt ceiling if he offered to resign.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the level of extremism we deal with here when we\'re talking about this kind of logic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They need to do their job.\xc2\xa0 They\'re hurting -- the only people they\'re hurting -- well, they\'re hurting obviously the Republican Party, nationally.\xc2\xa0 But they\'re also hurting their constituents.\xc2\xa0 They\'re hurting average folks out there.\xc2\xa0 Because as some of these financial experts have noted, default is far worse, but even shutdown has an effect on GDP, which, in turn, has an effect on hiring; which, in turn, has an effect on the ability of families across the country to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>And we\'ve been climbing out of this recession for a long time now and we\'ve made significant progress.\xc2\xa0 And this kind of manufactured crisis is a slap in the face to the American people who have been working so hard to get to where they are today and want to keep moving forward, not backward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question on another subject.\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Research Service was asked to provide a legal opinion on whether the Pay Our Military Act could legally pay the death gratuity, and they say there appears to be sufficient legal basis upon which a court could hold that the best reading of the term "payment" would be to go ahead and pay the death gratuity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it was the Department of Defense\'s position that they would not be legally able to.\xc2\xa0 This was in the briefing that they gave Congress prior to the debt ceiling and in statements made by an Under Secretary of Defense to the press prior to -- sorry -- prior to October 1st and the decision by Republicans to shut down the government -- that the effect of a lapse in funding would be the Department of Defense would be legally unable to make those payments.\xc2\xa0 So the Pay Our Military Act emerged after that.</p>\n<p>It\'s important to remember -- and we had this discussion yesterday -- from the beginning, we were arguing, don\'t shut down the government.\xc2\xa0 There would be myriad negative consequences to doing that.\xc2\xa0 We explicitly, through the Department of Defense, noted this specific potential consequence.\xc2\xa0 Every hour of every day since the Republicans shut the government down, we have been asking them to reopen the government so that more consequences would not occur, including this one.\xc2\xa0 The Pay Our Military Act was written, passed and signed into law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It was my understanding the judgment -- that since it did not explicitly call for or allow for this, that an alternative had to be found.\xc2\xa0 And the President, when he learned that an alternative needed to be found, asked his Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, to work with and speak to the Office of Management and Budget and with his lawyers to come to a resolution.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, you know now what it is, which is the Department of Defense is going to be able to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It looked like they could have gotten another opinion.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\'s a legal opinion that I understand was not the judgment at the time.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s interest here is that this be resolved.\xc2\xa0 It is always worth noting that this never had to happen if Republicans hadn\'t shut down the government, if they had, alternatively, decided to allow for the government to stay open at funding levels that were perfectly acceptable to them a month ago, and six months ago, and a year ago, and at spending levels that they hailed as a success and an achievement for them -- until they decided they weren\xe2\x80\x99t good enough and they would shut the government down over it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m great.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Bill, you started to say but went on to another point that this has been solved.\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying because of the Fisher House saying that they\xe2\x80\x99ll pay -- the reason why I ask is the Senate, about an hour ago, passed by unanimous consent legislation that appears to mirror what the House already passed.\xc2\xa0 And so my question really is, will the President sign that into law, or does the White House believe that the Fisher House paying this solves it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the Fisher House is contracting with the Department of Defense; through that contract, the Department of Defense obligates itself to reimburse the Fisher House upon the reopening of the government.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the Fisher House taking on the sole responsibility in perpetuity for making these payments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that mean you don\'t need legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It does mean that we don\'t need legislation.\xc2\xa0 And again, we go from day to day, and we discover new, terrible consequences of shutdown.\xc2\xa0 And when they get attention, lawmakers rush to propose a fix when there is an obvious available fix to avoid all of these negative consequences:\xc2\xa0 Open the government. The only harm you\'re doing is to the American people and to your party by continuing to shut it down.\xc2\xa0 Just open the government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President veto that legislation or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t think -- first of all, the legislation is not necessary.\xc2\xa0 Our view has been that this piecemeal funding is, again, a gimmick.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an attempt -- why is it that -- think about the amount of expended energy here to try to piecemeal solve their specific political problems every day when a bad consequence is revealed because of their decision to shut down the government.\xc2\xa0 They could save themselves a lot of trouble and the American people a lot of harm if they would simply open the government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up then, yesterday you took the question about when the President learned about the military death benefits not being paid.\xc2\xa0 A moment ago, you said, everyone should have known because the Pentagon warned everyone, I believe, on September 27th.\xc2\xa0 When did that filter through to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that in his evening walk with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on Tuesday, the President raised the concern about death benefits not being paid to deserving families.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. McDonough explained that the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defense were trying to find a solution and that the Pay Our Military Act did not appear to fix it.\xc2\xa0 The President directed Mr. McDonough to get creative and get it solved within 24 hours.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Department of Defense had been approached by the Fisher House Foundation, which had generously offered to make charitable donations to these families from its own funds.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, developed a solution overnight.\xc2\xa0 They determined that DOD could enter into a rush agreement with the Fisher House that would essentially make the organization a government contractor that could deliver benefits and enable DOD to reimburse the costs it had incurred after the shutdown ends.</p>\n<p>Again, shutdown never should have happened.\xc2\xa0 It was a choice made by Republicans, a choice that, for those who paid attention, included an awareness of the fact that among the many consequences potentially would be this one.\xc2\xa0 When the Pay Our Military Act -- which was a bill supported by both parties and signed by the President to address some of the unfair consequences to our military families and those who support them -- was passed, and it was viewed by some at least that it did not solve this specific problem, the President said, get creative and solve it in 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 And they solved it in less than that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for answering that question.\xc2\xa0 Two other short ones.\xc2\xa0 I want to just clarify, because I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked several times and at the risk of belaboring the point, but Gene Sperling, earlier today, I think sat down with Ron Brownstein of the National Journal, and suggested that he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing -- that the President would be willing -- and this gets at what Jon and I think Jim were asking, and others -- that the President would be willing to sign a clean debt ceiling without reopening the government.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve heard you answer it a couple different ways, because you have said over and over they should turn the lights on and reopen the government; they should also take default off the table.\xc2\xa0 Gene Sperling, one of the top economic advisors, suggested you could do one without the other.\xc2\xa0 I understand everyone is trying to nuance this, but just can you state clearly, does it have to be both to then enter into negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s the part -- see, you just added something to what Gene said that I think reflected what I\'ve said, what the President said, which is that he wants Congress to do both.\xc2\xa0 He wants Congress to fulfill both of its fundamental responsibilities -- open the government, i.e., turn on the lights; pay our bills; i.e., do not allow for default to happen for the first time.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress takes action without partisan strings attached on either of those, that would be a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And the President said himself that he would sign it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Boehner proposal is only to do one.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I heard a lot of things said.\xc2\xa0 What I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen is a bill.\xc2\xa0 And one thing that I think the Speaker and the Leader and other Republican leaders in the House sort of circled around was this idea that we should be sitting down and having sustained, serious negotiations about our budget priorities and reaching common ground and finding consensus and compromise.\xc2\xa0 And the President has long held the same view.\xc2\xa0 What he does not believe is that the American people should be punished day after day in exchange for Republicans being willing to sit down and have a negotiation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What is the rationale for that?\xc2\xa0 What are they seeking to achieve by shutting the government down day after day after day, when the President has been willing all year long to have these conversations and negotiations, and has demonstrated far more than they have thus far a willingness to offer proposals that are difficult for Democrats to accept as long as they are part of a comprehensive and balanced approach to dealing with our long-term challenges?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one, promise.\xc2\xa0 Important story overnight:\xc2\xa0 The Libyan Prime Minister apparently was kidnapped by gunmen.\xc2\xa0 Then there were reports suggesting he was released.\xc2\xa0 My question would be what do you know about it?\xc2\xa0 And has the President been briefed?\xc2\xa0 I assume he has.\xc2\xa0 What has he been told, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to all this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly the President has been briefed, and I can tell you that we condemn the kidnapping of the Libyan Prime Minister, and we are pleased to hear that he has been released.\xc2\xa0 The United States supports Libya\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to fulfill the aspirations of the 2011 revolution for a democratic, secure and prosperous Libya.\xc2\xa0 The people of Libya deserve a democracy based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work closely with the Libyan government as it continues to build its capacity to deliver security and good governance to the people of Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I understand that the Prime Minister himself has now addressed the events, and I would refer you to him and his office for details about what happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly, about that act that we were just talking about, the Honoring the Families of Our Fallen Soldiers Act -- you said legislation is not needed.\xc2\xa0 So a very simple yes or no, since the Senate has passed it, will the President veto that or will it just sit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ll have to -- when I walked out here, I was unaware that legislation had been acted on in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 The President directed that this be resolved, and it has been.\xc2\xa0 What is preposterous is this notion that we should piecemeal fix all the consequences caused by shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Because, guess what, even the most competent Congress in the world couldn\'t do that without still causing harm to the American people.\xc2\xa0 If they\'re concerned about the harm done by shutdown, they should open the government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let you find out what the position is now that you\'ve been made aware of the Senate\'s movement on that.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, in the conversation the President had with the American people and with reporters in this room just a couple of days ago, at one point he apologized that Americans have to put up with this right now.\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to the families of those servicemembers who did not receive death benefits and apologized to them that they didn\'t receive those death benefits?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any private conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 The President took action to solve this problem, ordered a creative solution to solve this problem, a problem caused by House Republicans who decided to shut the government down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I fail to see anyone in the House Republican leadership explain why, why this is a good thing to do, in exchange -- by the way, these benefits were held up because Republicans wanted to defund Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 These benefits were held up because they wanted to get what they could not get through the legislative process, what they could not get from the Supreme Court of the United States, what they could not get in a national election for President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s why all of these consequences that you read about and see and hear about have occurred.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re all unnecessary, because all the President has asked for, and what all the Senate and House Democrats have asked for is that the House pass a continuing resolution funding the government at levels that House Republicans support.\xc2\xa0 What is so hard about that?\xc2\xa0 Why punish the American people over refusing to -- because you refuse to accept what you wanted?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary of Veteran Affairs Eric Shinseki yesterday testified that if the shutdown continues into late October, compensation payments for more than 3.8 million veterans will not be made in the month of November.\xc2\xa0 Acknowledging in this conversation you spoke about the President pushing for creative measures in terms of death benefits, will the President push for creative measures to help those --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, my answer is the same.\xc2\xa0 There are so many consequences of shutdown that Congress has a responsibility to resolve all of them with one vote in the House of Representatives that would receive a majority -- votes from Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Open the government.\xc2\xa0 Solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 And then, let\'s get about the business of dealing with our longer-term budget challenges.</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From your discussions with the first row my takeaway is that -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well said, sir.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My takeaway -- and thank you, row one --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A negotiation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My takeaway is that the President is open to signing the short-term raising of the debt limit even if he does not get from Congress an accompanying clean CR -- is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll just try again.\xc2\xa0 The President believes -- the answer is yes, but he is not paying a ransom for Congress to do its job.\xc2\xa0 Because the only people who get hurt -- well, the American people get hurt when the Republicans shut the government down.\xc2\xa0 The American people get hurt when those who believe default is not a problem are listened to and followed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could we just take a yes?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just need a definition of ransom.</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 The President of the United States stood before you at this podium and answered this question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying he won\'t negotiate.\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying he\'ll sign a clean extension of the debt ceiling, but he is not going to negotiate on the other stuff until the shutdown is over?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes?\xc2\xa0 Yes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President will not pay a ransom for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s all.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s the "pay a ransom" --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You see it as a ransom, but it\'s a metaphor that doesn\'t serve our purposes of figuring out what\'s actually going on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just don\'t want to write it wrong.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you guys are just too literal then, right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just want to accurately report what\'s happening.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The closing of the American mind and failure to appreciate metaphor and simile.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just break it down in regular terms?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, like, we\'re trying to be accurate in our description of what\'s going on.\xc2\xa0 We just want to make sure we\'re not saying the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No negotiations.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking me a lot of questions based on a bill that does not exist and may never exist, and doesn\'t even reflect what the Speaker of the House and his colleagues discussed a couple of hours ago.\xc2\xa0 So I think we ought to see whether they\'re serious about putting the matches and the gasoline aside when it comes to threatening default.\xc2\xa0 And if they\'re serious, we\'ll evaluate what they\'ve moved forward on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What the President has been crystal-clear about all along is that it is unacceptable to him that the Republican Party, driven by the tea party caucus, try to extract ideological objectives in exchange for opening the government and raising the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So your position is that until then, you\'ll continue to obfuscate?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said we need to see whether they\'re serious about \xe2\x80\x9cputting the matches and the gasoline aside.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You\'ve also said they want to keep a "nuclear weapon in their back pocket."\xc2\xa0 So is keeping a nuclear weapon in the back pocket the same as putting the matches and gasoline aside?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Where are we going --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or even better, can we stop talking about matches and gasoline and nuclear weapons and start talking about what\'s actually happening?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wish we knew.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there is nobody who has followed the machinations in the House Republican conference for the last several weeks -- and, you might argue, for the last several years -- who has any clear picture about what they\'re going to do and when, and whether they\'re going to do the right thing by the American people, which is open the government and raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so just to use your statements, do you see "putting the gasoline and matches aside" as consistent with "keeping a nuclear weapon in your back pocket?"</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let me explain those metaphors and I\'ll refrain from using them.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly believes that it would be far preferable if Congress were to pass a bill that would ensure that the United States could pay its bills for a longer duration, longer than the hypothetical six weeks that has currently been discussed.</p>\n<p>But as he told you guys just two days ago, if a clean debt\xc2\xa0 -- a clean bill raising the debt ceiling for six weeks were to hit his desk, he would sign that.\xc2\xa0 It would be a sign -- it would be at least for a short period of time the removal of that threat.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that the implication of a willingness only to raise the debt ceiling for six weeks is that Republicans haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten over their obsession with using the threat of default as a means to try to extract concessions from him to do harm to the world economy, the American economy, and the American middle class in exchange for trying to achieve their political demands.</p>\n<p>But he answered this question; I answered this question.\xc2\xa0 What remains to be seen is what the Speaker of the House will actually put on paper and what he could get through his rather disparate conference.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he signs one without getting the other, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he negotiating with threats?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s signing a bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s just signing the debt ceiling, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, and you still don\'t have the government open.\xc2\xa0 I think the question we\xe2\x80\x99re all trying to get at is that, is he then negotiating with still the threat of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 By signing a bill?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, he signs one of them.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re -- obviously, the President also said at the news conference and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said he wants both.\xc2\xa0 We get that.\xc2\xa0 He wants both.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he wants both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he only gets one, he\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed -- and I think we should let some others in the other row, as Peter said --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Please.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- speak and ask questions.\xc2\xa0 But what he has said is that Congress needs to do both.\xc2\xa0 If does one, that\'s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 But he will still insist that they do the other.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The third row is going to be really mad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll tough it out.\xc2\xa0 Just saying.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April is over your right shoulder.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that he would sign the clean debt limit.\xc2\xa0 Will he do the kind of obvious interim step and ask the House Democrats to support that clean debt limit without the CR, to make it happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think his position is clear.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated it; he told you two days ago; I\xe2\x80\x99ve restated it.\xc2\xa0 I think beginning to -- now the level of hypothetical here is reaching the absurd because we don\'t know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s October 10th.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s just that there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me -- this is all in the hands of a Speaker whose direction has been unclear, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, for the past several weeks.\xc2\xa0 So we heard from him and other leaders today, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what they are actually going to propose, and evaluate it once we see it.\xc2\xa0 But it does nobody any good for me to speculate, based on you speculating, what we might support that we may never see from them.\xc2\xa0 They know our position.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, in the conversations the President has had with the Speaker and the public statements he made, that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear what his position is both to them and to you.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if they do the right thing -- if, in fact, they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to cease listening to Jeff Sessions, who should be reassuring the world that the bondholders will be getting their payments -- an assertion that seems to contradict what J.P. Morgan said earlier this year, which is prioritization would be like the financial equivalent of that Hieronymus Bosch painting of hell.\xc2\xa0 Who are you going to believe?</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, wait.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 Oh, you had two, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 Margaret.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nice try, though.\xc2\xa0 So in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting at 4:35 p.m. or whatever --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just want to say that I\xe2\x80\x99m probably the first and maybe the last Press Secretary who\xe2\x80\x99s ever gotten to say \xe2\x80\x9cHieronymus Bosch\xe2\x80\x9d from the podium.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So far.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think I had that poster in college.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Anyway.\xc2\xa0 So this --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tell me more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 So in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, are we just looking, then, at purely a discussion of the six-week debt limit extension, since you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do the ransom/shutdown thing?\xc2\xa0 Then is the half-hour, hour, or however long today takes\xc2\xa0 -- do you think that the boundaries of that are going to be just how to extend the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think you are still holding out hope --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that it will be the discussion of both today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss both.\xc2\xa0 The President will say what he\xe2\x80\x99s said already to leaders of both parties, which is that Congress ought to act and open the government, stop punishing the American people, stop punishing the middle class, stop doing deliberate harm on a repetitive basis to the economy, and instead open the government, raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And then let\xe2\x80\x99s do what Presidents and members of Congress have done over many years and decades, which is sit down and hammer out our differences and reach a compromise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President has demonstrated, in the wake of his reelection, an ample willingness to meet the Republicans halfway. And what we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this year, unfortunately, is a similar willingness.\xc2\xa0 And when Democrats in the Senate responded to the insistence by House Republicans that they pass a budget so that we could return to regular order and do what Congresses have done for decades and pass a budget that is representative of a compromise between the Senate and the House -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what the House demanded -- so the Senate said okay and they did it.\xc2\xa0 And the House then said, never mind.\xc2\xa0 And 19 times, Senate Democrats asked House Republicans to do what they said they wanted to do, and 19 times, House Republicans said no.\xc2\xa0 And today, we hear they want to have a conference.\xc2\xa0 Well, good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in making those points to the House Republicans, will the President at that point plan to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will pass the\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before I read out the meeting, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let the meeting happen.</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Granted that the President is an advocate for nuclear nonproliferation, both foreign and domestic, I do want to ask you about some real things that are being talked about on the Hill that aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a clean debt ceiling increase.\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans are talking about adding in language that would bind the Treasury Secretary, prevent him from using extraordinary measures.\xc2\xa0 I want to know if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that is acceptable, possible, unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a follow-up to that on the Senate side.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I will, when it gets to what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying versus what they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually put on paper and submitted, beg your forgiveness to say that I will wait -- we will wait to respond until we actually see a bill.\xc2\xa0 House Republican leaders say a lot of things, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to respond to all of them. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what they actually propose, see if they\xe2\x80\x99re serious about raising the debt ceiling and removing the threat of default, and for how long they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do that, and then we can assess how we move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to clarify, you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling that out?\xc2\xa0 And then the actual follow-up I wanted --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to respond to -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99re proposing.\xc2\xa0 I get that anonymous Senate -- or I mean House Republican staff may be telling reporters -- good staffers, good reporters -- and maybe what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is accurate, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 But in the end, we respond to actual proposed legislation.\xc2\xa0 And when we get it we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make that assessment.\xc2\xa0 Fair enough?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll assume the same answer for the Senate side.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to the issue of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in this evening\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the GOP leadership, the House GOP leadership, and your definition of ransom.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President going to say to the GOP leadership about corporate tax cuts, offshore drilling, Keystone pipeline and Obamacare this afternoon?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to say to them, and the other issues that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll read out the meeting once it happens.\xc2\xa0 What I know the President will say is that it is the right and responsible thing to do for the elected members of Congress to stop punishing the American people by shutting the government down, and stop threatening further punishment on the American people by threatening default, and just take that off the table. And then let\xe2\x80\x99s get about the business of having a serious negotiation about our budget priorities, something the President has amply demonstrated he wants to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And then also, we understand some Democratic leaders from the meeting last evening said the President made it clear that he is willing to negotiate for investments in early childhood education, children\xe2\x80\x99s activities and infrastructure investments.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a little bit about that?\xc2\xa0 Some of those Democrats are talking about what the President said he wants to put on the table with the negotiations.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about what a normal budget negotiation would look like, absent these threats -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll refrain from metaphors -- absent the threats of continued shutdown or default.\xc2\xa0 And I think what the President was talking about was the investments that are in his budget.\xc2\xa0 And he believes very strongly and passionately that these are wise investments that we need to make in our children and their education, and wise investments that we need to make in key areas to allow our economy to grow, and our infrastructure and research and development.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the proposal he\xe2\x80\x99s put on the table.\xc2\xa0 Those are:\xc2\xa0 the better bargain for the middle class that the President has been talking about, and there are proposals in his budget and proposals that he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about since, that he would, in a budget negotiation, argue passionately for.\xc2\xa0 And he believes firmly that we are our best and our strongest as a nation and as an economy when the middle class is expanding, and when the middle class feels secure.\xc2\xa0 That has been proven out in our past, and we need to return to that focus, rather than the kind of political games and manufactured crises that have been occupying everyone\xe2\x80\x99s time these last several weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on something else related to the government shutdown, there are some persons, particularly the American Academy of Pediatrics, who are very concerned about some of the kids -- 200 to 300 kids who have metabolic and genetic issues that need treatment from the NIH, and they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about funding.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling like the President needs to work on that as well to get some kind of special funding in the midst of this shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Is there --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, what is absolutely true is that there are terrible consequences of shutdown.\xc2\xa0 There are inconveniences and then there are real hardships caused by it.\xc2\xa0 And Congress needs to open the government.\xc2\xa0 This is the result -- the potential for -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of the specific example in any detail, but this is the result of the decision by Republicans to refuse to accept funding levels that they once said met their -- fulfilled their dreams of what they could get out of Democrats and the President.</p>\n<p>So the responsible thing to do for those children, for military families, for veterans, for hardworking Americans across the country, for small businesses who need loans, is to open the government.\xc2\xa0 The President is not asking for anything in return.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, a lot of the question --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I can\'t answer every specific instance of hardship or consequence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But these are life-or-death issues.\xc2\xa0 And then some of these people are concerned that our President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, I get it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is allowing monies go other places.\xc2\xa0 What about these issues?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I get it.\xc2\xa0 There are just countless stories of the negative effects of shutdown, so let\xe2\x80\x99s end the shutdown.\xc2\xa0 The President is not asking for anything in return.\xc2\xa0 No partisan strings attached, just end the shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, for the outside world, if I may, as an outside observer looking at this dispute, without resorting to metaphors, is this good?\xc2\xa0 Is it a sign of strength or weakness of the American democracy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The greatness of democracy is that it allows for free and open debate, and allows for the freely elected representatives of the American people -- or of any people where democracy has taken root to have themselves heard.\xc2\xa0 And that is the case here, even when it is messy, and even when there are less-then-ideal outcomes to that debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it is the responsibility of leadership and being elected to Congress -- in this case, here in the United States, or parliaments elsewhere -- to act responsibly and to advocate for your passionately held positions, but not to the point of punishing the people you serve because you don\'t get what you want.\xc2\xa0 And that is what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here.</p>\n<p>So obviously, observers of this debate both in the United States and around the world will draw conclusions based on what they see and what they know about our history.\xc2\xa0 What I think is obvious is that the greatest nation on Earth, when it comes to the economy and its extremely valuable position as the safest investment in the world, should not toy with that, which is why we should not flirt with default, why we should not listen to those, against the collected wisdom of a whole lot of experts in the field, who say default wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bad -- because it would be.\xc2\xa0 It would be terrible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I come here from the IMF.\xc2\xa0 And this is exactly what --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thought you came from Russia.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I came to the briefing from a briefing at IMF.\xc2\xa0 They are holding their annual meetings now.\xc2\xa0 And this is exactly what they are talking about.\xc2\xa0 This is the main subject for them, too.\xc2\xa0 But they are saying what the question is -- because I am supposed to ask questions, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hopefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is speaking for the Americans?\xc2\xa0 Because there is a commitment from the U.S. at the IMF, approved a couple years ago, two or three years ago, for the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Andrei, I think for everyone\xe2\x80\x99s sake, what\xe2\x80\x99s the question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 At the IMF, there is a reform plan approved by the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been held back two years by the U.S. Congress.\xc2\xa0 Does it mean that in the future, when the U.S. makes a commitment, it needs to say it is a commitment made by the President and the Congress?\xc2\xa0 Who speaks for the U.S. on foreign policy with one voice?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On foreign policy?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President.\xc2\xa0 So what about the Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the Congress plays a very important role in a variety of ways when it comes to the conduct of foreign policy and the funding of foreign policy initiatives. But I think if you read the Constitution, that delineation of power is pretty clear.</p>\n<p>Don -- sorry, the person next to Don.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Nick with Gannett Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s recent op-ed called on the President to take a page from his governing book.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was talking about government reforms, taking your medicine, that type of thing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I didn\'t see it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is very interested in having serious-minded negotiations with Republicans over funding our budget priorities.\xc2\xa0 The President would also note that since he has been President, our deficits have fallen at the fastest rate since well before you were born, and that he wants to continue that work.\xc2\xa0 And that requires tough choices, but it also requires investing in our economy so that it continues to grow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Growth begets jobs.\xc2\xa0 Jobs helps the economy grow further, helps us reduce our deficits.\xc2\xa0 And we need to make the right choices and the right decisions.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward, as he has all year long in his many meetings and conversations with Republican lawmakers here in Washington, to the ability to have those compromise-focused negotiations.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s pattern of taking evening strolls with his Chief of Staff, which is an interesting comment that you made.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember him taking evening strolls with Rahm or Jack Lew.\xc2\xa0 Can you just elaborate on it -- is that a new habit that he has?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I recall he would do that with previous Chiefs of Staff.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a nice place to take a walk and a good place to have a conversation.\xc2\xa0 So it is true that the President and Chief of Staff on occasion go for a stroll and talk about all the various issues that have arisen throughout a day.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, the spectacular weather that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been experiencing in Washington has come to an abrupt end, but maybe it will improve in the near future.</p>\n<p>Thanks, all, very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House consider Ronald Reagan a financial expert?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we threw that in there because Ronald Reagan said -- I appreciate the -- here\xe2\x80\x99s the compare/contrast.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s Steve King, presumably who, I assume -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put words in his mouth -- admires President Reagan, says that \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the credit of the United States is going to be collapsed.\xc2\xa0 All of this talk has been a lot of false demagoguery.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if he thinks that President Reagan, when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBringing the government to the edge of default threatens the holders of government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits\xe2\x80\x9d in September of 1987 was engaging in a lot of false demagoguery.\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So henceforth we can consider the White House agreeing with President Reagan as a financial expert?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we can agree that President Reagan was right when he said we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t default or flirt with default.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:58 P.M.
