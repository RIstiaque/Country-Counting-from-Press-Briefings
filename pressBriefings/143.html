Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:05 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time over the course of this week talking about the global economy and the impact on the U.S. economy, if any.\xc2\xa0 And we got another important data point today that bears mentioning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe did learn from the Department of Labor that the United States economy, in December of 2015, created 292,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a good report.\xc2\xa0 The revisions from the two previous months were good.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say on many occasions that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get too disappointed if there\xe2\x80\x99s one jobs report that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet expectations, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t get too excited when there\xe2\x80\x99s one jobs report that exceeds expectations.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at are the broader trends, and that is what I think the American people can be justifiably excited about.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last two years have been the strongest two-year period of job creation since the last two years of the Clinton administration.\xc2\xa0 That was 15 years ago now -- 16 years ago now.\xc2\xa0 The decline in the unemployment rate over the last two years is the fastest two-year decline in the unemployment rate in 30 years.\xc2\xa0 And included in this data was some additional information about wage growth -- something that has been drawing the intense focus of the President, of course.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have seen is that over the last 12 months, wages have grown by 2.5 percent, which is not quite as fast as we would like, but is the fastest rate of wage growth that we have seen since the end of the Great Recession.\xc2\xa0 And that represents an important improvement in a key metric that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to watch closely.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with all that, Kevin, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about that or other topics you would be interested in today.\xc2\xa0 So why don\xe2\x80\x99t you fire away.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I wanted to ask -- two Iraqi-born men who came to the U.S. as refugees have been arrested on terrorist-related charges by federal authorities in Texas and California.\xc2\xa0 And some are arguing that perhaps this is an indication that the screening process for refugees is not stringent enough, that something maybe you missed with the screening process.\xc2\xa0 Could you address that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I have seen the announcements from the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Because they have ongoing investigations into these two individuals, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to discuss specific cases from here.\xc2\xa0 But there are a few things I can say generally that are relevant to that news.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is that you have heard me on a number of occasions describe how our law enforcement and our national security professionals work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 And they are incredibly skilled, they\xe2\x80\x99re patriotic Americans, and they have access to incredible resources.\xc2\xa0 And they use all of that to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 And these cases in particular are good examples of how the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community, our law enforcement, and other national security agencies work effectively together to keep us safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to refugees specifically -- this is something that we talked about quite a bit at the end of last year -- but there are some relevant facts that do bear mentioning.\xc2\xa0 The first is that no one is allowed to short-circuit the system.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that individuals who are admitted to the United States through the refugee process undergo the most rigorous screening of any individual that enters the United States.\xc2\xa0 That includes careful review of biographic and biometric information that is both reviewed and collected.\xc2\xa0 There are in-person interviews that are conducted.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of that screening process, the burden of proof is on the applicant to demonstrate that he or she is credible, that he or she qualifies for refugee status, and is otherwise eligible to enter the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a number of reforms that have been added to this screening system over the years that have made this system tighter and better.\xc2\xa0 That includes adding additional databases that are used in the screening process.\xc2\xa0 That means that there are databases that are maintained by the Department of Defense, the National Counterterrorism Center, a variety of other intelligence agencies.\xc2\xa0 There are international law enforcement databases that are also maintained where this information is run through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd all of this is an indication of just how thorough that process is.\xc2\xa0 I think the other thing that is relevant here is that means that there are substantial amounts of information about these individuals that is collected.\xc2\xa0 That is information that, if warranted, based on information that\xe2\x80\x99s been obtained by law enforcement that can be then used to investigate individuals.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that you do willy-nilly, or based on a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity or their religion, but is something that can be -- it is information that can be used to investigate individuals if their behavior warrants it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, as we see in these two cases, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got law enforcement officials working closely with national security officials to take steps to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne last thing.\xc2\xa0 I know that these kinds of situations are likely to prompt calls from the other side that are now familiar, that suggest that the United States should somehow impose some sort of religious test or a test based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s ethnicity to limit their ability to enter the United States.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t represent who we are as a country.\xc2\xa0 And most importantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 That is our top priority.\xc2\xa0 That is the top priority of our law enforcement officials.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the top priority of our national security officials.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the top priority of the officials who manage the refugee system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo all of this is consistent with our national security interests and consistent with the kinds of values that the United States has long stood for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 White House officials are meeting with the tech industry about how to disrupt the Islamic State group and other organizations.\xc2\xa0 What exactly should the tech industry be doing better?\xc2\xa0 Can you provide some specifics about what you\'re seeking from them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, it is true that there are some senior White House officials, including the White House Chief of Staff; the President\xe2\x80\x99s top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco; the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, Megan Smith are participating in a meeting with a number of other senior national security officials in the U.S. government, including the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a meeting that the President alluded to in his address to the nation last month that talked about the need for the government and counterterrorism officials and law enforcement officials, in particular, to work more closely with the technology community to fight terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And this kind of meeting and this level of engagement is consistent with what the President called for.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the goal here is to find additional ways to work together to make it even harder for terrorists or criminals to find refuge in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little before that there is a precedent to this that law enforcement officials in the U.S. government have been able to work effectively with technology companies to combat child pornography.\xc2\xa0 And there obviously is -- technology leaders are patriotic Americans.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t have any desire for child pornographers or would-be terrorists to be using their tools and their technology to harm innocent people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any specific proposals from the White House to the tech industry that you are making?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the meeting hasn\xe2\x80\x99t started yet, so I certainly don\'t want to get out ahead of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I do think there is an opportunity for there to be a robust discussion about ways we can make it harder for terrorists to leverage the Internet to recruit, radicalize, and mobilize supporters to carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tSurely we can have a discussion about ways to create, publish, and amplify content from credible sources that counteracts the radicalizing messaging from ISIL and other extremists.\xc2\xa0 Given the way that technology works these days, there surely are ways that we can disrupt paths to radicalization, to identify recruitment patterns, and to provide metrics that allow us to measure the success of our counter-radicalization efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo certainly the U.S. government and our national security and law enforcement officials have some ideas of things that they would like to discuss with the technology community.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m also confident that leaders in the technology community are going to come with their own ideas about -- ideas about topics that should be on the agenda, and ideas for accomplishing the kinds of goals that I just enumerated.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, there should be some common ground that we can find here between law enforcement, the United States, and these technology companies.\xc2\xa0 And that will be the kind of conversation we\'re hoping to have later today out in California.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, shortly before we came in here, there were reports that a suspect in a shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia is saying that he did it in the name of Islam.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on this matter?\xc2\xa0 And are there concerns that this is another terrorist attack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ayesha, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you this is actually the first him hearing of it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether or not the President has been briefed on it.\xc2\xa0 But we can certainly check on it for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, some Democratic leaders in Congress are denouncing Homeland Security raids on recent undocumented people from Central America.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the President to stop these raids.\xc2\xa0 Is the President hearing these concerns?\xc2\xa0 Are there plans to change strategy regarding these raids?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ayesha, we\'re of course aware of these concerns.\xc2\xa0 But the enforcement strategy and priorities that the administration has articulated are not going to change.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xc2\xa0 We have focused those enforcement efforts on high-priority areas that we have identified.\xc2\xa0 That is specifically criminals, as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 That\'s important in keeping our communities safe.\xc2\xa0 That means individuals that have criminal convictions or a criminal history will certainly be prioritized for removal.\xc2\xa0 This is consistent with the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve described our priorities, that we are seeking to deport felons -- not break apart families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other area of priority that is important is to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re maintaining security at the border, and that means individuals who have only recently crossed the border are also priorities for removal.\xc2\xa0 Now, the other thing to keep in mind is that these enforcement strategies and actions are consistent with the need to follow due process.\xc2\xa0 And each of these individuals is considered on a case-by-case basis for any sort of humanitarian or asylum claims they may have to make.\xc2\xa0 And their legal remedies are exhausted before they are deported.\xc2\xa0 And, again, that is an indication that we are committed to working through due process on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s relevant because you actually have a President of the United States who has worked hard to use his own executive authority to try to make that process more fair.\xc2\xa0 After all, there are 700,000 people that have benefitted from DACA, from the -- these are DREAMers.\xc2\xa0 The President has also sought to use his executive authority -- and this is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s being litigated in the courts, potentially in front of the Supreme Court later this year -- to further expand the group of people who could be given the opportunity to remain in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo certainly the President is aware of this issue, is focused on making sure that we can have a more fair and just immigration system that I think just about everybody who looks at it agrees is broken.\xc2\xa0 And the one way that we could solve this is for Congress to finally take overdue action to reform our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And we know exactly how to get that done.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bipartisan agreement about how to get that done through the United States Senate but, unfortunately, House Republicans blocked that common-sense proposal despite the fact that it was supported by Democrats and Republicans all across the country, including leaders in the business community, leaders in the labor community, and leaders in the law enforcement community.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, just a quick question.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the arrest of the refugees, where are things at in the review of the fianc\xc3\xa9 visa program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on that process.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 This is something that both the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security are working on together, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, where is the tech meeting taking place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in San Jose, California.\xc2\xa0 So these are senior White House officials and top law enforcement officials based here in Washington, D.C. that are traveling out to California to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that there are -- we can get you some greater detail about who is actually participating in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I believe that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they talking part by way of video hookup?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There may be some.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the White House officials that I described before are all going to be there in person.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How big a problem is it that a terrorist is using the Internet for radicalizing and recruiting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have seen that this is a tactic that more extremist organizations are attempting to use.\xc2\xa0 And whether it is somebody who -- we have seen that ISIL, in particular, is using some sophisticated strategies to try to radicalize individuals around the globe.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re particularly effective at it but they\xe2\x80\x99re by no means the only extremists who have resorted to using these tools.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are organizations like AQAP and other more closely linked al Qaeda affiliates that also use technology to try to recruit supporters and to inspire them to carry out acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that we\'re mindful of.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are obviously a lot of complicated First Amendment issues and other things.\xc2\xa0 But our sense here is that there is some common ground that we should be able to find with technology companies.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned before, many of these technology companies that are participating in the meeting today are run by patriotic Americans.\xc2\xa0 And they certainly don\'t have any interest or desire in seeing their tools and their technology being used to aid and abet terrorists, or certainly make it easier for terrorist organizations to recruit followers and incite them to carry out acts of violence against innocent Americans.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re committed to trying to find that common ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect a readout after the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get you some more information about what exactly is discussed.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect any sort of breakthrough announcements or agreements to emerge from this discussion.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly is only the latest in a series of discussions that the Obama administration has convened with technology leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the President traveled out West to the Cybersecurity Summit on the campus of Stanford University last February, some of these issues were on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that these were some of the issues that were discussed at the United Nations Security Council meeting that was convened at the most recent U.N. General Assembly back in September, where efforts to counter violent extremism were discussed.\xc2\xa0 And some of the countering -- some of the strategies that are used by extremists online were part of that discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It must be seen as a very urgent problem in order to dispatch officials at that level to a meeting out on the West Coast.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is an indication that it is a priority of the President and of our national security team to counter the strategy that ISIL is so clearly pursuing online.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you referring to websites by ISIL and AQAP?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a variety of tools that we know that these extremist organizations use to try to disseminate their message, to try to recruit followers, and to try to inspire them to carry out acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- certainly some of it is social media, but some of it also the broadcasting of information.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned in response to Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s question, there is a precedent for us to try to confront this kind of problem.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are some people who try to make money based on the selling and trafficking of child pornography.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re using websites to do that.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to work effectively with the tech community to counter those efforts.\xc2\xa0 We, of course, haven\xe2\x80\x99t eliminated that practice, but we have enjoyed some success in countering it by working effectively with the technology community.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that we can do the same thing when it comes to countering the actions of extremists online.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is encryption part of the agenda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up.\xc2\xa0 And this is a particularly thorny element of that discussion, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an important one nonetheless.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as he\xe2\x80\x99s said on many occasions, believes in robust encryption.\xc2\xa0 He believes that that is important to the success of this technology.\xc2\xa0 But also he believes that\'s important to protecting the civil liberties and privacy of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at the same time, we can\'t allow terrorist organizations or extremists to be able to use communications online as some sort of safe haven that is beyond the reach of law enforcement and national security organizations.\xc2\xa0 And so that certainly means that there are some complicated issues to work through.\xc2\xa0 And the solutions aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily obvious.\xc2\xa0 But what is obvious is that there should be some common ground between technology companies who certainly do not want to see their tools used to carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the State of Union.\xc2\xa0 And I did hear what you said yesterday about opportunities and challenges, but for those of us who love laundry lists, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could give us any clues on policy directions or priorities that the President will be bringing up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s talk again on Monday; maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s more I can do to help you.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, just back on the tech meeting.\xc2\xa0 Is there any hope that even -- I know you said that you\'re not expecting an announcement here -- but of an eventual program that would help you guys more aggressively monitor and take down social media posts from terrorists or terrorist sympathizers?\xc2\xa0 Is that the kind of goal of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the goal -- I don\'t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a specific program that we would envision as a goal.\xc2\xa0 I think the hope is that we would be able to find ways to work effectively with the technology community that would make it harder for terrorists to use the Internet to recruit followers and incite them to carry out acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know what form that will take.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that will be part of the discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You still aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in pursuing legislation on encryption specifically?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of wondering if that continues to be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, our policy on that has not changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, why not?\xc2\xa0 If this is such a kind of big issue, why kind of leave it up to tech companies to do it voluntarily?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me address that in two ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is, as you point out, this is a complicated and big issue.\xc2\xa0 And Congress has not demonstrated a lot of success in handling complicated big issues recently.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold up sort of Congress as the ideal way to handle these kinds of things.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, as I pointed out, the reason that we want to work with the technology industry to try to address some of these problems is precisely because it\xe2\x80\x99s in their interest to do so.\xc2\xa0 It is not part of their business model.\xc2\xa0 It does not make them look good.\xc2\xa0 It does not help them win more customers to be associated with these kinds of efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s why they push back to some extent, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On encryption, the idea of being that if they can provide a private platform so the government can\'t snoop in your emails, that that\'s a selling point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly being able demonstrate their ability to protect somebody\xe2\x80\x99s privacy I think is certainly good for their business model.\xc2\xa0 Having that technology be used by terrorists, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure is.\xc2\xa0 They would know better than I.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not involved in running their business, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to look at their numbers.\xc2\xa0 But I do, however, speak with a lot of confidence in saying that the vast majority of these technology companies are run by patriotic Americans.\xc2\xa0 And I do believe -- and you can go ask them -- they\'re more likely to have this conversation with you than they are with me, but I do have a lot of confidence that those companies that are run by patriotic Americans are not interested in seeing their tools or their technology used by terrorists to harm innocent Americans.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is not what they were designed for.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'re hopeful that there would be a willingness on their part to work with us to try to find some solutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign pledge in his New York Times editorial?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Please do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just kind of wondering if you can put some parameters on that -- what a candidate would have to do or not do for the President -- or I guess what a candidate would have to do or not for the President to say I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to vote for you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to campaign for you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to fundraise for you.\xc2\xa0 And also how he would kind of extricate his actions with the DNC or the DSCC or whoever else in that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that I have like a comprehensive list of outlines.\xc2\xa0 But I think based on the discussion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having over the last several days, you have a pretty good sense of what the President is talking about when he talks about common-sense gun safety measures.\xc2\xa0 So these are things like closing the gun show loophole, or closing the no-fly, no-buy loophole.\xc2\xa0 This is the loophole that -- at this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s no law that prevents somebody who is on the no-fly list from being able to walk into a gun store and purchasing a firearm.\xc2\xa0 Surely, if the government has determined that it\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous for you to board an airplane, then it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 This is another common-sense proposal that the President has in mind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the op-ed that you just cited, the President talked at some length about the responsibility that gun manufacturers have in gun safety, and there are some common-sense things that we believe that gun manufacturers could do.\xc2\xa0 And there are certainly some common-sense things that -- well, there are certainly some things that Congress has done that don\xe2\x80\x99t fit common sense that have absolved gun manufacturers from assuming some of that responsibility.\xc2\xa0 So those are some of the things that the President has in mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bernie Sanders, for instance, voted against legislation that would have given liability to gun manufacturers -- or shielded them from liability.\xc2\xa0 So if Bernie Sanders was the Democratic presidential nominee, the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t campaign for him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly noticed that Senator Sanders told one of your colleagues/competitors here when asked this very question he was eager to point out that Senator Sanders had made clear that he was willing to revisit that position.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the goal here, right?\xc2\xa0 We want people to change their minds.\xc2\xa0 We want members of Congress to start taking different positions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I am not familiar with Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s record, so maybe this is something that he said on many previous occasions.\xc2\xa0 But if not, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to start taking some credit for changing some minds on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is -- ultimately the goal here is to get a different outcome that better reflects the views of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about somebody like Heidi Heitkamp, who was a big vote for you guys on TPA, and the President made a big point of saying, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go out and campaign and raise money for these people who put their neck out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there is no denying the fact that I think that when it comes to most issues, the President agrees with Senator Heitkamp on them, particularly when it comes to a whole range of economic issues and national security issues -- that there are a lot of reasons for them to be on the same page.\xc2\xa0 But what the President made clear in that op-ed is that when it comes to this issue, he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to be a single-issue voter.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes that other people will, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that that will have an impact on the kinds of decisions that Democrats and Republicans make on this issue in the future when they\xe2\x80\x99re serving in the United States Congress and when they\xe2\x80\x99re called to vote on them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Sorry for James Rosen-ing for a second, but -- (laughter) -- El Chapo apparently was just captured, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard reports about that or have any update on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the -- I did not see that report before we walked out here, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll check on it for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin, it seems only fair that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- (laughter) -- it seems only fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Keep it short.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Short and pithy, right?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw the report in the Journal about the Hellfire that was sent to Europe and then somehow inadvertently was sent over to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the President is aware of in that circumstance and how on Earth something like that could happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Kevin, unfortunately, I cannot comment on specific defense trade licensing cases and compliance matters.\xc2\xa0 Under the Arms Export Control Act, the Department of State licenses both permanent and temporary exports by U.S. companies of regulated defense articles.\xc2\xa0 And U.S. companies are responsible for documenting their proposed shipping logistics in their export license application as well as reporting any shipping deviations to the department as appropriate.\xc2\xa0 So obviously this is something that both the Department of Defense and the State Department are quite keenly aware of, I think as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 And so for additional questions about this, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those two agencies.\xc2\xa0 And just because of the ongoing casework here, I\xe2\x80\x99m just very limited in what I can say about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could use a \xe2\x80\x9cJosh-ism\xe2\x80\x9d -- (laughter) -- as a general matter, how concerned is the White House about this report?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I think you can tell, based on what I have read, that this is an issue that the administration takes very, very seriously, I think for quite obvious reasons.\xc2\xa0 And because both the Department of Defense and State Department are, again, I think for obvious reasons, quite interested in getting to the bottom of what exactly happened, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty constrained in what I can say, but there may be more information that the Department of State or Department of Defense can share with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me ask you about the tech meeting, and I just want to kind of maybe take a slightly different look at it.\xc2\xa0 If, on the one hand, the suggestion is maybe the White House and tech companies can partner to eliminate, if not curtail, the ability for some of these terrorism groups to recruit online, would the White House then be interested in doing the same thing as it relates to domestic terrorist groups, or groups that might also -- white supremacists or other groups that might domestically be recruiting others to potentially do harm to other Americans?\xc2\xa0 In other words, are you going to take the same tack in both cases, or is this specific to overseas audiences?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to understand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try to describe it to you this way.\xc2\xa0 I think our goal here is to prevent any sort of extremist, any sort of terrorist -- whether foreign or domestic -- from using technology to carry out an act of violence against innocent Americans.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very interested in countering that from whatever source it emanates.\xc2\xa0 I think the reason that we spend so much time talking about ISIL and their activities online is that they have shown a particular ability to use these tools to maximum effect.\xc2\xa0 So that is certainly the threat that we are quite mindful of.\xc2\xa0 But as you point out, taking the right steps and pursuing the right approach would allow us to make it harder for anybody to use these kinds of tools to encourage someone to carry out an act of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that get to the fundamental American ideal of free speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 There are certainly First Amendment issues here, but there are a variety of ways in which our First Amendment rights are curtailed.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t yell \xe2\x80\x9cfire\xe2\x80\x9d in a crowded theater because that would potentially harm the people in the crowded theater.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not a First Amendment attorney, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not denying that there are complicated issues here, but surely we can find some common ground when it comes to finding ways to prevent terrorists from using technology to harm innocent patriotic Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one, on guns.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a full-court press.\xc2\xa0 We saw the President make his announcement, and then of course the town hall, and now the op-ed today in the Times.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 Why this approach, this sort of all-in approach?\xc2\xa0 And how does the White House respond to criticism that even if everything that the President has proposed had been in place previously, it would not have impacted the circumstances that affected the country so dramatically last year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, there are a couple other things that are coming.\xc2\xa0 The President is convening a call later this afternoon with activists who share the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion for this issue, and having an opportunity to speak to all of them is an important moment.\xc2\xa0 So I think all of you will have the opportunity to hear about that call.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI also wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that this is the kind of issue that comes up in the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 So we talked earlier this week about how the State of the Union is a large platform where the President is commanding the attention of both houses of Congress and any number of Supreme Court justices and members of the Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 And I would expect that this is an issue that he\xe2\x80\x99ll bring to their attention, because he\xe2\x80\x99s surely focused on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the issue of guns, I wanted to ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s town hall meeting last night during which the NRA did not participate.\xc2\xa0 And the President seemed pretty frustrated about that and said that the NRA had been invited on multiple occasions to talk about this issue, discuss the issue.\xc2\xa0 Would the President debate a high-level official from the NRA, engage in a public discussion with an official from the NRA if the opportunity were to present itself?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think that was the opportunity last night, and the NRA missed its chance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the NRA did miss their chance yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And based on the response that they have offered up after the meeting, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling very good about the way they looked by dodging the opportunity yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Demonstrating their unwillingness to participate in a rational, measured, fact-based discussion of these issues that was taking place just a couple of miles from their national headquarters I think might be an indication that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of confidence in their case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo they have had multiple opportunities to participate in events here at the White House and then to accept an invitation from CNN to attend yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s event, and they turned it down.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President ever spoken with anybody from the NRA before, personally?\xc2\xa0 Phone?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s just never happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Off the top of my head, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific conversations.\xc2\xa0 I know that there is at least one instance where a representative of the NRA attended a meeting that was convened by the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 That was a number of years ago.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll note that the NRA walked out of that meeting trashing the Vice President in the efforts that the administration was pursuing at that time to take common-sense steps that would make our communities safer.\xc2\xa0 So there certainly is ample reason to question the good faith of people at the NRA to engage in these kinds of discussions.\xc2\xa0 But yet, that has not prevented us from inviting them to participate.\xc2\xa0 And even then, those invitations have been rebuffed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to find out what the administration is doing about these Syrian children.\xc2\xa0 There have been images of starving Syrian children that have been in news reports over the last several days.\xc2\xa0 I assume the President is aware of this, or the whole security team is aware of this or wherever -- the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the administration can do about these kids?\xc2\xa0 Because the pictures are just horrible to look at.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s gut-wrenching.\xc2\xa0 The situation inside of Syria and the impact that it is having on millions of innocent people is terrible.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of violence and chaos that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing millions of Syrians flee when they seek to enter any of the neighboring countries or to travel all the way to Europe.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that they\xe2\x80\x99re running away from their homes.\xc2\xa0 And it is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly is something that the President is mindful of, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen once again step forward to play a leading role here.\xc2\xa0 The United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to try to meet the needs of those who are fleeing violence inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that assistance getting to these -- it seems like that assistance it not getting to these folks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, obviously, to get humanitarian assistance into a war-torn country like Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could be the top donor of humanitarian assistance, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the wherewithal, the ability to get that assistance to those people, it seems like sort of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is some assistance that is getting into Syria.\xc2\xa0 But, look, in a war-torn chaotic country like this where you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the central government has utterly failed and extremists like ISIL have stepped in, there are consequences and they\xe2\x80\x99re grave.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, the assistance that is provided by the United States is reaching some Syrians inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 We also know that there are millions of Syrian migrants that have fled to neighboring countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 Countries like Jordan, even Turkey, are bearing a significant burden when it comes to trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs of those fleeing violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has provided substantial financial resources to those countries as they try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to Cheryl\xe2\x80\x99s question about the State of the Union, she asked about the laundry list.\xc2\xa0 And I guess it was my understanding from listening to you folks over the last couple of weeks that this is going to be a nontraditional, unconventional State of the Union speech.\xc2\xa0 There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a whole lot of time left to get a big laundry list done.\xc2\xa0 So is the White House telling various agencies and departments, hey, hold off on these laundry lists, the President is going to go big picture on this one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot that we have been able to accomplish over the last seven years.\xc2\xa0 And typically, states of the union -- a State of the Union address will cover the important progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to talk about in that regard.\xc2\xa0 The President also has a year remaining in office, and he is quite focused on making sure that we maximize the opportunity that exists during his final year in office to get a lot of important business done.\xc2\xa0 Some of that is business that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to get done with Congress.\xc2\xa0 Some of it is business that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get done using the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority.\xc2\xa0 And some of it is business that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get done by deepening our engagement with countries around the world and continuing to play the kind of leading role in the international community that has made the country safer and advanced our interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to talk about in that regard.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what the President will focus on in the context of the State of the Union speech are the kinds of challenges that are facing America over the long term.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at a critical juncture in our history.\xc2\xa0 We have made tremendous progress digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession.\xc2\xa0 The jobs numbers that were released today are just the latest piece of evidence that testify to that progress.\xc2\xa0 And now the question is, what are the kinds of decisions that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make right now that are going to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pass onto our kids and their kids the most prosperous, the most secure, the most fair United States that\xe2\x80\x99s ever existed.\xc2\xa0 And those are the kinds of challenges that the President is looking forward to focusing on in the State of the Union.</p>\n<p>\n\tLauren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, is it significant that Congress was able to get the repeal of the Obamacare bill to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, as the critics are saying?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying that this is the first time that has happened, and therefore this is significant.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not significant.\xc2\xa0 It got them nothing.\xc2\xa0 And with the stroke of a pen, the President dispensed with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, the Little Sisters of the Poor filed a Supreme Court brief against the federal contraceptive mandate, saying that the administration wants the petitioners to do precisely what sincere religious beliefs forbid, and ultimately that the brief claims that the government is violating federal law by speaking for the sisters in saying that the accommodation is compatible with their religious beliefs.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any thoughts on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have our own strong case to present to the Supreme Court about the steps that we have taken to ensure that we are balancing the religious liberties of Americans with the rights of other Americans to make their own decisions about their health care.\xc2\xa0 And fortunately, there are a wide variety of federal judges all across the country that have agreed that this policy has been implemented appropriately, and that gives us a lot of confidence in the argument that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make before the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tIsaac.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I just want to come back to the Sanders issue for a second.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the movement that he seems to have made about changing his mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I will acknowledge that I am not intimately familiar with the ins and outs of his record, and so it may be that this is a position that he has previously described -- a willingness to sort of revisit his previous support for liability legislation that benefits gun manufacturers.\xc2\xa0 So I was being a little flip in talking to Justin.\xc2\xa0 But look, if that represents a genuine change in his position as a result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, then that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xc2\xa0 But look, if he\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for the President to be comfortable to campaign for him if that\xe2\x80\x99s what it comes to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I just acknowledged, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the ins and outs of his record.\xc2\xa0 But if Democratic voters across the country confirm that he is the Democratic nominee, then I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend some time here learning about his record and learning about what is on his agenda to make that decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it was unintentional, the mention of the gun manufacturer liability issue in the op-ed as a -- since that\xe2\x80\x99s been an issue in the primary race, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something that was an intention from the White House to put in there as a factor in the primary race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 The President was quite intentional about raising this issue as it relates to gun manufacturers and how they have essentially abdicated their responsibility to ensure that their business practices and that their products are safe.\xc2\xa0 But that was not any sort of secret or subtle signal to demonstrate a preference in the presidential primary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President takes this seriously.\xc2\xa0 And any candidate running for any office is going to have to demonstrate their commitment to these common-sense measures before they can expect to get the support of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I asked you the other day about whether he would campaign for Republicans who were pro-gun control -- a Pat Toomey or a Mark Kirk.\xc2\xa0 You said then that you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about it.\xc2\xa0 It seems like he\xe2\x80\x99s made up his mind about single-issue voting in sort of the positive -- or the negative sense.\xc2\xa0 Like, he won\xe2\x80\x99t vote for people who are not with him on gun control.\xc2\xa0 Have you discussed with him the prospect of supporting Republicans who are where he wants them to be on gun control?</p>\n<p>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out.\xc2\xa0 But these kinds of elections are a test.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the President will be considering the kinds of policies that are put forward by the Democratic candidate in those races.\xc2\xa0 And look, if both candidates support the kind of common-sense gun safety measures that the President does, then that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xc2\xa0 That means the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision about who to support will then involve a consideration of a range of other issues.\xc2\xa0 A consideration of those other issues probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stack up very well for a lot of congressional Republicans, including Senator Kirk and Senator Toomey.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, the President is serious about this.\xc2\xa0 And this certainly applies to presidential candidates, and it applies to candidates for both houses of Congress, but also to candidates further down the ballot, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier this week, Debbie Wasserman Schultz had an interview that was published, and she said that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as progressive on criminal justice reform issues as some people in the Democratic Party might want her to be.\xc2\xa0 She is the DNC chair.\xc2\xa0 Criminal justice reform is a priority for this White House and this year.\xc2\xa0 Have you guys had any discussions with her about making sure that she\xe2\x80\x99s where you want people to be on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any detailed conversations that have taken place between the White House and Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And to be honest with you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite familiar with the particulars of her position.\xc2\xa0 But I think the thing that we are gratified by is that there is an emerging bipartisan consensus around a lot of the issues that are being discussed in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly have tried to nurture that bipartisan agreement, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing that in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you push forward with this, do you want the chair of the DNC to be with the President, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly will be making a strong case to everybody, including Democrats who are close to the President, that criminal justice reform, like the type that\xe2\x80\x99s being discussed by many members of the House and Senate, is consistent with the priority that the President has placed on making our country more fair, but also making our communities more safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back on guns.\xc2\xa0 And with an eye towards writing those curtain-raiser scripts and pieces for the State of the Union -- and a couple other issues, but first on guns -- is the President maxed out now on what he can do with the executive actions on gun control --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is, based on the most recent analysis that has been done, the answer to that question is, yes, the President has done as much as he can.\xc2\xa0 That said, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that at some point over the next 12 months, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s team goes back to take another look to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s more that can be done.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping in reserve in terms of additional actions that the President could take.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s really outstanding on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, and has been since the day after he took office, is Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 What is the status of consideration there when it comes to the constitutionality of the President taking unilateral action or executive orders?\xc2\xa0 Are those under consideration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, let me just note, since you brought it up, that the Department of Defense has announced the transfer of an additional Guantanamo detainee to Kuwait.\xc2\xa0 This individual was approved for transfer by the Periodic Review Board just last fall.\xc2\xa0 And that actually brings now the number of Guantanamo detainees to 104.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good illustration of our effort to chip away at the population there and to try to resolve these individual cases in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 That, ultimately, is what the President is focused on, which is keeping the country safe.\xc2\xa0 And closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay would make us safer, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority in accomplishing that goal, the President talked about this at his news conference that he convened three weeks or so ago today, in fact, to say that his focus right now is getting Congress to remove the obstacles that they have put in place of closing the prison.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any executive options that may or may not be available off the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Kuwait, the Saudi coalition has apparently used cluster bombs, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has suggested may amount to a war crime.\xc2\xa0 The Yemeni government has also ejected the U.N. human rights representative.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to either one of those things going on there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the U.N. announcement that you just referred to.\xc2\xa0 I will just say that the -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said for some time, the Saudis are justifiably concerned about the security situation in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 They obviously share a border with Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And they have legitimate concerns about that chaos having an impact on the security situation in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the United States believes that diplomacy is what will lead to a satisfactory resolution of that situation.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. has obviously been leading that effort.\xc2\xa0 There were conversations in Switzerland back in December to try to advance a diplomatic initiative.\xc2\xa0 And the parties to those talks are planning to reconvene next week, I believe.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are going to continue to encourage all sides to participate constructively in that process and try to bring the chaos and bloodshed in that country to an end.</p>\n<p>\n\tDevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to an earlier question on the incident in Philly.\xc2\xa0 You said the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been briefed on this.\xc2\xa0 But really, from seeing reports of it, it was just a terrible, scary incident caught on tape with the police officer ambushed; 13 shots point blank.\xc2\xa0 And right before you came out, you didn\'t see it, but the chief said that this guy did it in the name of Islam.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify, have the circumstances of this incident in any way reached the White House or the NSC?\xc2\xa0 Is it on the radar?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Devin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that I had not seen this before I walked out here.\xc2\xa0 So as usually is the case, there are other people at the White House who are aware of this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just, given the tight turnaround here, it did not make its way to me.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that based solely on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve described, it sounds like it is a good reminder of the debt of gratitude that we owe our men and women who serve in police departments all across the country.\xc2\xa0 These are men and women who put on the blue uniform and put their lives on the line to try to keep our community safe.\xc2\xa0 And the vast majority of them take that job very seriously.\xc2\xa0 They do so with professionalism and courage.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly owe them a debt of gratitude.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And thankfully, in this case, he survived.\xc2\xa0 So some good news.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on that, yesterday you referred to sort of a similar at the Paris police station as an \xe2\x80\x9cattempted terror attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You\'ve just laid out you don\'t know the circumstances here, but how do you make that determination in an incident of this nature?\xc2\xa0 And what goes into that?\xc2\xa0 Can you just refresh what goes into how you would say that this is a terror -- attempted terror act?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding about the situation in France yesterday is that no one was harmed in that incident other than the assailant.\xc2\xa0 And it was French law enforcement authorities that had said that based on what they knew about the situation, that it was a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s what led me to say what I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, once we have an opportunity to take a close look at these details, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could, on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails, which has been an ongoing story -- as you know, overnight, the State Department released 3,000 pages at about 1:00 a.m.\xc2\xa0 And one is getting some attention today; it\xe2\x80\x99s an email between Mrs. Clinton and her top aide, Jake Sullivan.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to receive some sensitive talking points via \xe2\x80\x9csecure fax.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And she writes, \xe2\x80\x9cIf they can\'t [fax them], turn into nonpaper [with] no identifying heading and send nonsecure.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s getting a lot of chatter from Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s critics on this.\xc2\xa0 But does the White House think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to remove markings and send information in a non-secure format?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not aware of all the circumstances of what exactly transpired.\xc2\xa0 But my guess is that the Clinton campaign has done some digging on this to try to understand the circumstances of this particular communication.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them to get a better understanding of exactly what it says about the way that Secretary Clinton handled sensitive information.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But surely you\xe2\x80\x99d say that removing markings that would -- on any document from anybody in the administration that was to be transmitted, to remove the marking of the classification of some kind would not be appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Devin, it is not uncommon for the administration, in pursuit of transparency, to release redacted information that if un-redacted were to otherwise be subject to some classification.\xc2\xa0 So again, without knowing the details of what exactly was being discussed there, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to comment on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quickly, the last thing.\xc2\xa0 The organizers of the next Democratic debate have released their qualifying criteria today.\xc2\xa0 And there has been some speculation that perhaps Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is sort of on the bubble.\xc2\xa0 Mrs. Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and others have come out and said all three candidates should be on the debate stage.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a view?\xc2\xa0 Should everyone be included in this next debate forum?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about this particular issue.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President believes that a robust discussion among the Democratic candidates for President is good for the process, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the party, and it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the organizers of the debate, the DNC, and the media organization that\'s sponsoring the -- I don\'t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s an ABC debate or not -- but ultimately somebody -- ultimately those will be the parties that are involved in determining who should participate in the debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an NBC debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 Tune in, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just lastly, and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s late, but to follow up Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question about Syria and these terrible images of hunger --\xc2\xa0 the point of the reporting there, as I understand it, was that it\xe2\x80\x99s become identifiable how starvation is being used as a weapon in that war by both sides, a conscious military strategy, if you will.\xc2\xa0 Given that, and given that the United States is a huge donor humanitarian aid and all that, yet this still happens, is there any -- does the President feel comfortable with this in the sense that there\xe2\x80\x99s no contemplation of a humanitarian mission to try and do more on a humanitarian if not military front to affect what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground there?\xc2\xa0 Because I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly that you can\xe2\x80\x99t do safe zones, it\xe2\x80\x99s too many resources, so on and so forth.\xc2\xa0 But clearly things are getting worse, not better.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is true.\xc2\xa0 Things have been -- the conditions inside of Syria for innocent civilians have been terrible for a long time and they\xe2\x80\x99re not getting better.\xc2\xa0 And this is all -- the root of this failure goes back to the failed leadership of Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 His willingness to carry out terrible acts of violence against his own people by dropping barrel bombs on innocent civilians has led this country to be torn apart at the seams.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen extremist organizations like ISIL capitalize on that chaos to further the violence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as is usually the case, innocent civilians are feeling the impact the most.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such a robust response from the United States to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to put our credibility on the line to try to bring the international community together to try to find a -- to effectuate a political transition inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, Assad leaving power and a new credible government that reflects the will and ambitions of the Syrian people taking power -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an important way for us to start to end the chaos.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has also built an international coalition of 65 countries to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of robust response is commensurate with the terrible humanitarian situation that we see inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Josh, you spent some time this week talking about the auto sales in 2015.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the University of Michigan told us that the average fuel economy of those cars were down from 2014, and in December it fell below 25 miles to the gallon.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned that your goal of doubling fuel economy by 2025 is moving in the wrong direction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We still are confident that that is a goal that the U.S. fleet can achieve.\xc2\xa0 I think what economists have observed is that seeing the prices at the pump, that more Americans are considering purchasing less fuel-efficient vehicles, like trucks and SUVs.\xc2\xa0 I think what warrants mentioning is that those trucks and SUVs are much more fuel-efficient today than they were six or seven or eight years ago.\xc2\xa0 And that is a response to the kinds of high standards that the President put in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we do continue to see improvement, and there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done to meet the goal that the President set out.\xc2\xa0 I think when the President is talking about this issue, he regularly encourages people to be mindful of the fact that the low gas prices that we\xe2\x80\x99re all enjoying and benefitting from now are not going to be there forever.\xc2\xa0 And purchasing a fuel-efficient vehicle is -- when that\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate option, is a good bet over the long term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately we are making important progress when it comes to fuel efficiency, and a lot of that is due to the capacity for the American auto industry to innovate and put in place cutting-edge ideas that are bringing new technology that benefits the American people.\xc2\xa0 And none of that would have been possible had the President not placed a really big bet on American auto workers and the American auto industry.\xc2\xa0 And that big bet is paying off for those workers, for those companies, and most importantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s paying off for the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeslie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get back to the Hellfire missile that was found in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Senator Marco Rubio has sent a letter to the State Department calling it, \xe2\x80\x9castounding and inexcusable,\xe2\x80\x9d that people are just finding -- members of Congress are finding out about it now, reading the newspaper.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s asking a number of questions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether or not it came up --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My guess is he gets most of his information about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Congress through the newspaper, based on his attendance record.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, he raises a number of questions and among them are whether or not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m phrasing it a different way than he asks it, but whether or not the existence of the missile in Cuban hands was talked about during the negotiations in reestablishing diplomatic ties, and why it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t if it was not.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of insight into that, so we can take a look at that for you.\xc2\xa0 Right now, this is subject to an ongoing investigation by the State Department and the Department of Defense, so I\xe2\x80\x99m very limited in what I can say about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s something we wanted back.\xc2\xa0 So would we have not brought it up when we were talking to them when we reestablished embassies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All of that is unclear to me at this point.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I can\xe2\x80\x99t help you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if you\xe2\x80\x99ve already said this before, but on closing Gitmo, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that a certain number of prisoners could not be released.\xc2\xa0 What does the administration envision for them?\xc2\xa0 Would they go to, like, supermax?\xc2\xa0 Would they go to a domestic military base?\xc2\xa0 What would happen to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a question that is being considered by the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 What we know right now is that continuing to house those individuals at the prison at Guantanamo Bay is prohibitively expensive and does significant damage to our national security.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is not the only national security expert to conclude that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be closed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why people like President George W. Bush and other senior officials in the Bush administration who often don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with leaders in this administration about foreign policy issues, but in this case, they do agree that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is the right move because it makes us safer and it saves taxpayers money.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what that means is it means that we should transfer those individuals that have been approved for transfer.\xc2\xa0 So right now, the detainee population is 104.\xc2\xa0 Let me try to put some figures on this.\xc2\xa0 Forty-five of those individuals have gone through the process of having their case file carefully considered by the Periodic Review Board.\xc2\xa0 And that Periodic Review Board has essentially ruled that, under the right circumstances, these individuals can be safely transferred to another country.\xc2\xa0 Those circumstances often involve limitations on their travel, limitations on their communications, and other limitations that frankly are part of a range of security requirements.\xc2\xa0 And so essentially you could almost cut the prison population in half by transferring those individuals.\xc2\xa0 Obviously those kinds of transfers are the subject of protracted diplomatic engagements.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond that, there are 22 other individuals who have been referred for prosecution.\xc2\xa0 So these are individuals in whom the -- either the Department of Justice or the United States military has concluded that they could build a strong legal case in one venue or another -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a military commission or an Article 3 Court.\xc2\xa0 There are 27 individuals who are essentially in the category of continued detention, which means that they have not yet been cleared for transfer but their case is periodically reviewed by the Periodic Review Board.\xc2\xa0 There are 10 other individuals who are facing criminal charges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at some point, these individuals -- most likely in the category of continued detention -- are likely to make up what some have described as an irreducible minimum at the prison there.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do something with them.\xc2\xa0 And it is the view of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team that bringing them to the United States to a prison where they can be properly secured should not be an option that\xe2\x80\x99s automatically taken off the table.\xc2\xa0 Because if not, it\xe2\x80\x99s not obvious where else they would go in a way that would satisfy the concerns that we have about our national security interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is part of what the Department of Defense has been working on for years, and this certainly is part of the plan that the Department of Defense is preparing at the request of the President and prepared to present to members of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But practically speaking, they would have to remain in the custody of the U.S. military at some place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are a number of proposals that have been considered.\xc2\xa0 I guess the other way I can talk about this is there have been public reports about visits that have been conducted -- site surveys that have been conducted by the Department of Defense personnel to detention facilities across the country.\xc2\xa0 I know that they visited the Charleston Brig in South Carolina.\xc2\xa0 They visited Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.\xc2\xa0 And I know they visited at least one facility out in Colorado, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a number of potential facilities that could be used for this purpose.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, right now, Congress prevents that even being a realistic option.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just now that we\xe2\x80\x99re in 2016 and a few days away from the State of the Union, how would you assess your ability to work with Congress on the issues that you think you might be able to get done, given the fact that you started off with an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of angered some Republicans -- the gun measures -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ve started off with the gutting of the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood, resulting in a veto?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 Last year, around this time, there were a lot of Republicans who -- Republican leaders in Congress who had suggested that the President had poisoned the well in being able to work with Congress by taking executive action to try to reform some elements of our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that Republicans vehemently disagreed with.\xc2\xa0 But what the President\xe2\x80\x99s case was, was they said -- was he essentially said, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow a difference of opinion on one issue become a deal-breaker for all of the others.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately served as a useful way for us to work through a lot of these issues.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we wish Congress had done last year.\xc2\xa0 And there surely are a lot of things that we would like them to do this year that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the question is, are there things -- are there priorities that we share?\xc2\xa0 Can we work together and build another bipartisan majority to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement?\xc2\xa0 I hope so.\xc2\xa0 There surely were bipartisan majorities in the Congress last year.\xc2\xa0 Months after poisoning the well, Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate came together and passed Trade Promotion Authority.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that again this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mentioned earlier that there has been a discussion about criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 This is a priority of both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, and the President is very interested in nurturing the bipartisan agreement that could lead to legislation that would make our communities safer and our criminal justice system more fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if last year is any model, then we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that this will be a year where those areas where we agree, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make some progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBob.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Secretary of State Kerry indicated that Iran may be several days away from complying with the nuclear deal from last summer.\xc2\xa0 Let me get the White House take on that by asking, is this the first moment of certification that they are complying with?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming there are, of course, long-range checks in this whole agreement.\xc2\xa0 But are they complying?\xc2\xa0 Is this the time to start removing the sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bob, what we have said is that Iran has to comply with all of the sanctions *it\xe2\x80\x99s JCPOA commitments, and the IAEA has to verify that they have completed and complied with the sanctions *the commitments before Iran receives any sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 So the onus here, including on timing, is on the Iranians.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they days away?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t actually have a detailed assessment of sort of where things stand.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are additional steps they need to take.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey did a couple weeks ago do something important.\xc2\xa0 One key element of the agreement was seeing the Iranians reduce their stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent, and the Iranians did announce a week or two ago that they had completed the loading of 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium aboard a ship that was then sent to Russia.\xc2\xa0 That was an important part of the progress that they need to make to comply with the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is more work to be done.\xc2\xa0 And the agreement can only be implemented when the Iranians have finished their work and given the IAEA sufficient access to verify that that work has been completed.\xc2\xa0 Then, and only then, will we begin implementing the agreement and giving the Iranians the kind of sanctions relief from the tough international sanctions that we know they deeply desire.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any delay or stalling on their part, do you think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think, if anything, the Iranians have been working quite aggressively to take these steps so that they can get the benefits of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 But it means that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do some serious things.\xc2\xa0 They had to slash their stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 Right now Iran does not have enough nuclear material in Iran to make even one nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in addition to that, there are a range of steps that they needed to take to essentially gut the core of their heavy water reactor, plutonium reactor.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of steps that pertain to unplugging centrifuges, and a number of steps that they need to take to ensure that the IAEA can do the kind of rigorous monitoring that is part and parcel of this agreement that gives us confidence that this agreement will succeed in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those are all steps that need to be taken before Iran starts to get any of the benefits that are associated with the deal.\xc2\xa0 Okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Tara, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the irreducible minimum, because you talked about, with Guantanamo, about these prisoners that are going to be transferred maybe to the United States.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Fort Leavenworth.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know that people in Kansas have been complaining about this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been writing letters, some of the elected officials.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to reach out to any of these places where the prisoners -- where the detainees might get transferred to.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any sort of community-level outreach that\'s been done.\xc2\xa0 Right now, Congress has in place significant obstacles that prevent the transfer from moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can say is that at Fort Leavenworth there are already a number of very dangerous people who are being detained in that prison there, people who have been convicted of a variety of violent crimes.\xc2\xa0 So the reason that is -- that Department of Defense officials even visited that community is because of the expertise that they have demonstrated in housing individuals in conditions that protect the country and even protect the community.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the reason that I mentioned it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s do a week ahead here.\xc2\xa0 We should start first with the important event that will take place on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 The Kansas City Chiefs, winners of 10 in a row -- (laughter) -- will take the field against the Houston Texans down in Houston.\xc2\xa0 I will be rooting for the Chiefs to enjoy the first playoff victory in the NFL playoffs in I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s 22 years.\xc2\xa0 Little-known fact -- I actually attended that playoff game.\xc2\xa0 I was a freshman in college at the time.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how long ago it was.\xc2\xa0 But anyway, I don\'t know what the President is doing on Saturday; I\xe2\x80\x99ll be rooting for the Chiefs on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, as you all know by now, the President will deliver his final State of Union Address at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\xc2\xa0 Of course, as usual, the Vice President, the First Lady, and Dr. Biden will all attend.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday and Thursday, the President will travel to Omaha, Nebraska and then Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\xc2\xa0 While he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting those two fine communities, the President will highlight the progress that\'s been made in each state since he took office and talk about how we can continue to take action in the next year to move the country forward.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is looking forward to those visits.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a part of both of those visits, the President will spend some time in smaller settings visiting with members of the community, in addition to addressing larger crowds in both of those communities.\xc2\xa0 So like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about that next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then on Friday, the President will be back here at the White House and attending meetings here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, are there any other stops on Wednesday and Thursday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, just those two communities before the President returns to the White House on late Thursday afternoon, I believe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 With that, I wish you guys all a good weekend.\xc2\xa0 And go Chiefs.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:22 P.M.
