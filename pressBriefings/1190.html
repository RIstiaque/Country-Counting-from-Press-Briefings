EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Today, following on the off-camera, on the record gaggle we did yesterday, we are doing the same thing today to discuss another portion or the other aspect of this trip the President is taking to Latin America.\xc2\xa0 To brief you today I have on my right Dan Restrepo, who is the Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council; on my left, Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications.\xc2\xa0 And I will turn it over to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will, again, as yesterday -- I\'ll be briefing in just a few short hours, so if we could keep questions this morning to these gentlemen on the topic of the trip.\xc2\xa0 And then we can -- I\'ll be taking your questions in just a few hours.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just start by going through the schedule for the trip, then turn it over to Dan for some introductory comments, and we\'ll take some questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We start in Brasilia.\xc2\xa0 We arrive Saturday morning.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just echo what Mike Froman said yesterday, which is that there is an enormous economic potential to the relationship that is a core part of what we\'re doing here.\xc2\xa0 Brazil is a vastly growing export partner to the United States, a vastly growing emerging market, so as a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s continued effort to deepen our ties with emerging markets around the world, Brazil is a critical partner and critical stop on this trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will begin after an arrival ceremony Saturday morning with a bilateral meeting with President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil. This is obviously -- she\xe2\x80\x99s in the first several months of her presidency.\xc2\xa0 She has been very positive about the type of relationship that she wants to pursue with the United States.\xc2\xa0 So we see an enormous convergence of interest between Brazil and the United States and an enormous moment of opportunity here between a new President, again, who\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated an interest in working closely with the United States on shared interests.\xc2\xa0 So the two Presidents will have the opportunity to discuss a range of those issues.\xc2\xa0 And we can get into that a little bit today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the bilateral meeting, the two Presidents will have a press conference.\xc2\xa0 Then the President will drop by and attend a portion of a CEO Forum meeting.\xc2\xa0 This is a standing U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum.\xc2\xa0 I think Mike may have talked a little bit about it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Dan can as well.\xc2\xa0 Following that meeting, there will an official lunch hosted by President Dilma.\xc2\xa0 Following the lunch, the President will deliver remarks at the business summit that is being hosted throughout the day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be a series of sessions without the President, and then he will address the summit towards its conclusion in the afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Again, that will be an opportunity for him to describe the economic potential of the relationship, the growing export relationship that we have with Brazil, and areas of cooperation that we can pursue in sectors like energy and infrastructure where we\xe2\x80\x99ve, again, had an emerging relationship with the Brazilians.\xc2\xa0 That concludes the portion of the day on Saturday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sunday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Rio.\xc2\xa0 In Rio the -- I should add, actually, the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s component of the schedule, too.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll just do that as we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady is traveling with the President.\xc2\xa0 In addition to joining him at some of these official events, she\xe2\x80\x99ll also be doing a series of solo events on the trip.\xc2\xa0 So those of you who have traveled with us in the past know that she\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily popular overseas and is a huge asset to the United States in terms of her ability to reach out to the peoples of these countries.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this trip, she\xe2\x80\x99ll continue her efforts to engage young people around the world, particularly from disadvantaged communities and backgrounds, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to carry her message of encouraging young people to excel academically, to serve their communities, and to take an active role in building stronger ties between their countries and the Unites States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Brasilia, on Saturday, the First Lady will attend a cultural performance with young Brazilians, many from disadvantaged backgrounds who have participated in U.S.-sponsored exchanges and leadership development programs.\xc2\xa0 So that will be her independent event in Brasilia.\xc2\xa0 This follows on, in January 2010, when the First Lady met with more than 30 Brazilian youth who are participating in the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Youth Ambassadorship Program here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s her independent even on Saturday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, in Rio, the President will start the day by visiting the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio, which I think is the familiar image that many of us have when we think of the city of Rio.\xc2\xa0 Following that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver a speech.\xc2\xa0 This will be a speech really directed at the Brazilian people.\xc2\xa0 Just as we have a set of shared interests that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing on Saturday, we also have a set of deeply shared values with the Brazilians.\xc2\xa0 They are a democracy; they are a diverse country; they are a country that has pursued social inclusion -- so many of the values that we hold dear as Americans are shared by Brazilians, and so the President will be able to speak to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a core component of the kind of relationship we\xe2\x80\x99re building with Brazil, again, we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s a relationship guided by shared interests, a rapidly emerging power on the global stage, and we believe we can have a particularly close relationship with Brazil because of the shared values that we have.\xc2\xa0 So his speech will focus on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There may be additional events on that Sunday, but that\'s what we have locked in today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following his time in Rio, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move on to Santiago, Chile. Again, Dan can speak a little bit about this, but Chile is obviously a very close and longstanding partner of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a country that we have a free trade agreement with. It\xe2\x80\x99s a country we participate with in a range of key interests for us.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been, for instance, a critical partner on nuclear security -- one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s key initiatives -- and through the APEC -- Asia-Pacific forum that the President, as you know, has spent a lot of time seeking to reengage and shape.\xc2\xa0 They\'re a partner of ours in the Trans-Pacific Partnership within APEC, the trade framework that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.\xc2\xa0 So Chile is a country that, again, we will have the opportunity to advance a number of bilateral issues with on this trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After an arrival ceremony, the two Presidents will have a bilateral meeting.\xc2\xa0 After the bilateral meeting they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a press conference.\xc2\xa0 Following that press conference, the President will give a speech in Santiago.\xc2\xa0 This speech will be essentially the speech where he lays out the administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach on Latin America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I do want to underscore that this trip really, if you look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s first term -- we obviously attended the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad-Tobago in 2009; intend to do so next year.\xc2\xa0 But this is really the signal trip in terms of his Latin America policy in the first term.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s great interest, of course, in the region in the type of leadership that the American -- that the United States is pursuing.\xc2\xa0 So the President will have an opportunity in this speech to speak to the whole region and to lay out what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in a number of key areas, such as energy cooperation, citizen security, economic growth and development, and democracy and human rights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also add that Chile and Brazil are two countries that, again, have pursued in the past successful transitions from more authoritarian governments to democracy.\xc2\xa0 So given current events, some of us who\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to you about models of transitions that have succeeded in the past as it relates to countries like Egypt and Tunisia have cited, for instance, Chile, a country that went from a military government very successfully to a democratic government and that has thrived in the years since.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to speak to our shared values as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that speech, he has an official dinner that\xe2\x80\x99s being hosted by President Pinera.\xc2\xa0 And then that concludes the program in Santiago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The following day, March 22nd, we will move on to El Salvador.\xc2\xa0 This is an important stop as well.\xc2\xa0 When you look at the trip that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to Brazil, a key partner in the region and the global stage -- of course, a Portuguese-speaking nation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to Chile, a key partner in the region as well, and of course a Spanish-speaking nation.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Central America, of course, is a very important sub-region of the Americas and one that the United States has a longstanding relationship with, as well as substantial -- obviously Central American immigrant populations as well.\xc2\xa0 So we felt it was important to include a stop in Central America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve developed a good working relationship with El Salvador.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re one of the partners within our development and growth policy, and they\xe2\x80\x99re a country that we cooperate with on a range of issues related to economic growth and security, as well. So the President will meet with President Funes of El Salvador, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bilateral meeting, followed by a press conference.\xc2\xa0 So I\'d just note for your planning purposes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having three press conference with each of the leaders.\xc2\xa0 So there will be that opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then that night the President will have an official dinner with President Funes.\xc2\xa0 Then the last day, Wednesday before we come back, the President will have an opportunity to tour the National Cathedral in San Salvador and, at the National Cathedral, to pay respects at the tomb of Father Oscar Romero, who, of course, is a hero to many people in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Then following that he will have a chance to tour -- to visit some Mayan ruins before returning to the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just fill out the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s schedule before turning it over to Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Santiago, the First Lady will join the Chilean First Lady for a tour of the -- Dan can do this better than me, but the Museo Interactivo Mirador that will -- she will tour this museum. It will include performances for the two First Ladies by Chilean young people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following this visit the First Lady will deliver remarks to students at a local school.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a school that was built in 2010, and it will be graduating its first class of high-school-age students this year.\xc2\xa0 She will be able to speak personally in these remarks about her own upbringing and her pursuit of education and the importance of education, and she will share the view of the administration that education is key to a strong economy, and preparing young people is of course the key to how our countries will succeed going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many of the graduates in this class I just highlighted will be the first in their family to pursue higher education, so she\xe2\x80\x99ll underscore the importance of their achievement.\xc2\xa0 And the school also participates in what is a Chilean equivalent of the Teach for America program, which was established by young Chileans who attended graduate school in the United States and learned about Teach for America.\xc2\xa0 So it fits with her service message as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\'d add education is an area where, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s own speech in Santiago, he\'ll be able to discuss how the United States can deepen our educational ties and exchanges with Latin American nations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then finally, in San Salvador, the First Lady will meet with young people from Superate, an education and skills development program for disadvantaged young people -- so, again, continuing a theme of her engagement throughout the trip, of engaging young people with a message of education and service.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, with that, I\'ll turn it over to Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 To just give a bit of a quick overview in addition to what Ben has laid out -- from the earliest days of the administration the President has been engaged in creating a new relationship with the countries throughout the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Less than a hundred days into the administration he went to the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, where he met with all of the leaders in the Western Hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 There he laid out a vision of working as equal partners based on mutual respect and shared values, and committed himself and the administration to getting to work on the challenges of today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This trip gives us an opportunity to highlight the work that has been done and will continue to be done with a very important set of global-regional partners and leaders -- with Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador.\xc2\xa0 Each of these leaders that the President is visiting are ones that he has met with in the past -- President Rousseff before she was President, both in the context of the Brazil-U.S. CEO Forum, when they were here last year, and also in her role as chief of staff to President Lula in Copenhagen, among other places, the President had an opportunity, and at the last G20 as President-elect, had an opportunity to begin a conversation with her and discussions with her as to how we can deepen and broaden our relationship across a whole set of issues in the bilateral, in the regional and the global context.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Pinera also is someone the President has met with in connection with the Nuclear Security Summit held last year here in town.\xc2\xa0 Chile will be picking up the regional ball on that issue by holding a follow-up seminar for countries in Latin America in April as a formal follow-up to the Nuclear Security Summit, providing -- and the two Presidents will have an opportunity to discuss that issue, discuss cooperation on disaster response -- something that Chile, because of its geographic location and history, is well versed in.\xc2\xa0 And obviously they, too, last year had a significant earthquake and tsunami, about 13 months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And President Funes, who visited the President here last March, is another leader who is very much pragmatically focused on solving the challenges facing his population today; challenges that are very common in the Americas -- particularly Central America -- of finding ways to enhance sustainable economic growth and to address the challenges of citizen security caused by transnational criminal organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This gives the President -- again, it gives the President the opportunity to underscore working in partnership with these countries -- with the region writ large, a region that he has been personally and the administration has been engaged in at the highest levels throughout his presidency, in terms of the interactions he had bilaterally with leaders here in Washington, the G20 members that he visits with on the margins of the G20 -- be they from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, APEC members, as Ben mentioned, also from the region to include Peru, Chile and Mexico.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to continue pushing that work forward, highlighting the importance of the region, and also highlighting the restoration of American influence and appeal in the Americas, and the effect that that has had in diminishing the space for those who try to make a living politically on an anti-American sentiment.\xc2\xa0 That space has been reduced significantly over the course of the last couple of years, and this trip provides an opportunity to continue that; to show that the U.S. and President Obama are engaged in helping address the basic challenges facing people in the Americas today and is willing, ready, and able to engage constructively with the leaders in the region who are similarly positioned to focus on the challenges of today and not outmoded ideological arguments or outmoded ideological debates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I think we should just turn it over to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll do this as I did yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on some folks.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 My first is to follow up on the last point you were making, Dan, about the chance to highlight the diminished space there for some of these outdated arguments.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on kind of what you mean by that and what you think the President would like to highlight?\xc2\xa0 And Ben, also -- or actually, for either of you -- should we think about this as a trip where there will be concrete deliverables in addition to the themes you want to highlight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple words and then turn to Dan.\xc2\xa0 I think on your second question, it\xe2\x80\x99s both, in that it is a relationship-building trip with key partners.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that sometimes people overlook, when they kind of look at the scope of challenges in foreign policy, that there is really no region in the world that we\xe2\x80\x99re more deeply engaged in than the Americas in many respects, given the overlap of populations, given the depth of the economic relationship, given that this is in our neighborhood, and, again, given the very deep ties between the United States and these countries in terms of building democracy and security.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an overarching message that these relationships are critically important to having a hemisphere that works effectively on shared challenges -- that is enhancing economic growth, which is critical to us, of course, because as these economies develop, they\xe2\x80\x99re turning into substantial export markets for us as well -- and, frankly, to address global challenges.\xc2\xa0 Brazil is on the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re a country we cooperate with in many global forums like the G20 and others.\xc2\xa0 Chile is a member of APEC.\xc2\xa0 So I think in the first instance, advancing these relationships will allow us to better deal with both the hemispheric challenges we have and get better cooperation on the international stage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At each stop there are a series of concrete steps and agreements that will be reached on the types of issues that we pursue in the Americas -- issues related to energy, issues related to economic growth and security.\xc2\xa0 I think in many respects, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the continuum of our relations, given that these are countries we already have deep ties with.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re not transformative agreements and deliverables.\xc2\xa0 Rather they are a part of the ongoing effort to build deeper relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In particular, I think Mike Froman highlighted yesterday, in Brazil, we look at Brazil and see an enormous potential for economic growth and a deepening economic cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And so a lot of what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be focused on is what are the steps that need to be taken to unlock that potential.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been great growth; there\'s been a doubling of exports in the last five years.\xc2\xa0 But when we look at the convergence of interests we have on energy, on infrastructure, in other areas, part of what we want to be doing is opening doors for U.S. businesses to expand that type of cooperation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that will be a focus, for instance, at that business summit.\xc2\xa0 And then, again, in the region, I think that the deliverables speak to the ongoing building of relationships\xc2\xa0 -- things like, as Dan said, Chile was a key partner in nuclear security in the region, playing a leadership role, for instance, hosting the follow-on summit, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to address a range of the issues we cooperate on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your second question -- and Dan should weigh in on both if he likes, of course -- but I think what\'s happened is, if you remember several years ago, leaders of the region, like President Chavez and others, were able to stoke and capitalize on anti-American sentiment to pursue their own agendas.\xc2\xa0 I think it speaks to the fact that they no longer have nearly as much space to do that just in the amount of time you guys have spent probably paying attention to what they say.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because the fact of the matter is, if you look at any metric in the region, President Obama is a hugely popular leader.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a leader who has driven up by any public opinion polling that you might review the opinion of the United States and the opinion of U.S. leadership in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s important both because it makes it easier for countries to cooperate with us and to be our partner on issues that we care about.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also important because it shifts the dynamic in the region whereby we\xe2\x80\x99re not stuck in the same debate about something that happened decades ago or kind of Cold War mentalities around the nature of U.S. leadership.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s instead a forward-looking relationship between the United States and the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, I think we have vastly diminished that space.\xc2\xa0 I think the opinion of U.S. leadership is up across the region.\xc2\xa0 This type of trip only advances that.\xc2\xa0 And again, it serves to, again, take a lot of the wind out of the sails of those who would want to capitalize on anti-American sentiment and make it more difficult for governments in the region to cooperate with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 Yes, to add to that -- going back to the Summit of the Americas, where the President made very clear that he wanted to engage on the challenges of today to help make people\xe2\x80\x99s lives better, the part the U.S. can play in that, and recognizing that other countries and other societies and other governments need to step up as part of that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing increasingly throughout the region -- and you see it in the three leaders we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting -- are leaders who are being responsive to exactly that desire from their own populations; that they want leaders and leadership that is focused on the challenges of today and pragmatically working those challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think one of the major reasons behind the numbers that Ben was just talking about that the President enjoys throughout the Americas is a recognition that the President is aligned with that same interest of looking how can, together, in partnership, the countries of the Americas solve the challenges that people face in their daily lives, understanding that it is not something that the U.S. will come and do for, or do to, countries in the region, but something that we will be an active partner in doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that approach is actually addressing the challenges people live and making a difference in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what ultimately diminishes the space available to those who are largely focused on rhetoric and trying to stoke anti-Americanism and anti-elitism, which becomes harder and harder with each passing day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, both about Brazil, to both gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 In the first place, can you talk a little bit more about the speech the President will deliver there, and specifically if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to nod to the Brazilian aspiration to get permanent representation on the U.N. Security Council?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Brazil, do you expect the President to make common cause with Brazilians over the issue of Chinese currency, which they\xe2\x80\x99ve also complained about as being artificially too low?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 I believe Mike Froman spoke to the second question yesterday and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to add to that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Mike\xe2\x80\x99s answer stand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the speech, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to Ben in a moment.\xc2\xa0 With regard to the question of the United Nations, obviously the President and President Rousseff will undoubtedly discuss the United Nations, the United Nations reform, the role that Brazil is playing today on the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And they will also undoubtedly discuss this in a broader context of an embrace of global architecture that reflects global realities.\xc2\xa0 For example, and as Mike noted yesterday, the prominence of the G20 as the preeminent global economic forum has given Brazil a very important seat at the table on global economic issues.\xc2\xa0 Brazil has also played a role in IMF reform, where Brazil has become the tenth largest shareholder, having been a recipient not that long ago from the IMF.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the conversation that they will have will be a broad conversation on the importance of ensuring effective institutions for advancing peace and security in the world, and undoubtedly the U.N. will come up in that discussion.\xc2\xa0 And again, given the events of today, undoubtedly Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s role on the U.N. Security Council and how the U.S. and Brazil are working together in New York will be part of that conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just add that I think in terms of the speech, part of the message is that we very much welcome Brazil playing a substantially larger role on the global stage.\xc2\xa0 This has been something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as a thread through a lot of our foreign policy, which is that we have the anchor of our engagement with the world, which is our traditional allies, our European and NATO allies, our Asian allies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we want to cast a wider net in terms of the partnerships we\xe2\x80\x99re building with emerging powers in the world, like a Brazil.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we want to reshape the international architecture to better reflect that reality, and demonstrate, again, that we are welcoming to a nation like Brazil to pursue a greater role on the world stage, particularly a nation like Brazil that shares a set of values with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that will be part of the broader message he delivers.\xc2\xa0 And the specific question of the U.N. Security Council reform I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will come up in the context of the two leaders in their discussions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of their discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations for permanent representation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to discuss ways in which Brazil can, again, be better represented on the world stage.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken a number of steps in that regard that Dan mentioned with the G20 and the IMF.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing discussion around Security Council reform, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing their ambitions in that context.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan, you were talking about how the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit will be one to highlight what the U.S. can do with these countries and for these countries.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a different dynamic in the region -- Brazil, seventh largest economy in the world; Chile, very successful country; Latin America grew while the U.S. was and still is coming out of a recession.\xc2\xa0 So how do you see the President\xe2\x80\x99s wiggle room in the region with that message?\xc2\xa0 And how will that help counter Chavez at a moment when even if he\xe2\x80\x99s making as much noise as he usually does, a lot of people don\'t seem to be paying attention?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, in Chile, the speech to Latin America, will there be any mention of the free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 On your first question, that very dynamic that the Americas is a vibrant area that has very much arrived on the global stage is part of how the partnership process works, and it\xe2\x80\x99s part and parcel of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about of working shared challenges in a flexible way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For example, at the Summit of the Americas, the President laid out the proposal for the Energy and Climate Partnership of Americas.\xc2\xa0 And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a traditional U.S. \xe2\x80\x9cwe have the solution to the problem and you all are going to sign up to our way of doing it,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather it was a proposal to \xe2\x80\x9cwe have a set of countries facing a common challenge or a common set of challenges with different capabilities, different capacities; let us come together in different combinations to work those problems.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we have done exactly that.\xc2\xa0 And the three countries that we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting have been very important players in ECPA, in the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas -- Brazil obviously a world leader on biofuels and clean energy; Chile a world leader on solar energy; El Salvador has a huge geothermal energy potential and a significant mix of its energy matrix is geothermal.\xc2\xa0 And those three countries and many others in the region have been coming together to work on energy efficiency, on biofuels, on solar, on the adaptation necessary to deal with the effects of climate change in the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think throughout this trip you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see additional steps along that continuum of cooperation through the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas as demonstrative of this notion that you have a region that is a willing and capable partner -- or full of willing and capable partners -- to work on these kinds of issues, and the United States, understanding that we live in the Americas, we are part of the Americas, and need to work together to address these challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the Panama and Colombia FTAs, obviously, as the President made very clear in the State of the Union, these are important agreements.\xc2\xa0 We are committed to working on outstanding issues with the governments of Panama and Colombia, and hope to do so in a successful fashion that stays true to our interests and values.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re focused with regard to those agreements.\xc2\xa0 And that process that the President set out, that Ambassador Kirk has discussed in public, that process continues to unfold, and we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to working on these outstanding issues with our partners to ensure that basic labor rights are protected and the interests of American workers are, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the status now of the U.S.-Chilean talks on nuclear energy?\xc2\xa0 And to what extent has the situation in Japan rewritten the script on that issue, especially in Brazil and in Chile?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 In both places -- in Brazil, as Ben noted, one of the issues -- and as Mike talked about yesterday -- one of the issues that will undoubtedly be part of the conversation between the Presidents is a strategic energy partnership, of how we work better together on a whole range of energy issues.\xc2\xa0 And undoubtedly the issue of civilian nuclear energy will come up in the context of that discussion in Brazil, always mindful of safety and security issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With Chile, as I mentioned before, they are a regional leader in leading the follow-up to the Nuclear Security Summit that was held here last year.\xc2\xa0 We have been in discussions with Chile as it looks at its future to ensure that we are cooperating in a fashion -- or willingness to cooperate in a fashion that takes into account building greater capacity on safety and security issues related to its civilian uses.\xc2\xa0 That is a discussion that is ongoing and it is a discussion that will undoubtedly be part of the talks between President Obama and President Pinera next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the second part of my question, to what extent has the situation in Japan altered the script, if you will, on this issue at each stop, since it was going to be going into this a big deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously mindful of the security concerns in Japan.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, no country -- or few countries are better attuned to understanding the intersection of the types of security and safety concerns, I should say, that come from earthquakes and related events than Chile, which has experienced it itself.\xc2\xa0 So I think -- we have broad energy relationships with both of these countries.\xc2\xa0 Nuclear is one aspect of those energy relationships. So it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a part of our agenda with the two countries in the context of those energy relationships.\xc2\xa0 And safety is always a part of the types of conversations we have with other countries on these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, I think that will be part of the context for those discussions, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one of a longstanding and growing energy relationship.\xc2\xa0 I would also add, as Dan alluded to, that Chile -- with regard to Japan -- is a nation with disaster relief experience, recent experience with a massive earthquake and tsunami, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Japan will come up in that context, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, in the Nuclear Security Summit here, Chile shipped its HEU out in the context of their earthquake.\xc2\xa0 If you remember it was a somewhat extraordinary story of how they fulfilled their commitment associated with our Nuclear Security Summit of shipping their HEU out in the context of that earthquake.\xc2\xa0 So safety is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been very focused on -- as well as nuclear security -- with the Chileans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick thing.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to see the Chilean coal miners while he\xe2\x80\x99s there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have not -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no particular event planned around that right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have three quick questions.\xc2\xa0 One is has President Obama ever been to any of these countries in his life, not just as President?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the democratic reform in Chile and South America as sort of a model for the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Will the President make that comparison explicitly?\xc2\xa0 And finally, is this trip at all an effort to counteract China\xe2\x80\x99s growing influence in the region, or do you hope it will accomplish that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think, first, we can double-check it -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s been to any of these countries, as far as I know.\xc2\xa0 And I know he\xe2\x80\x99s looked forward to visiting the region, so I think this is the first time that he\xe2\x80\x99s visited these three countries.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if that has to be corrected, but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, yes, I think he will make the comparison.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think part of what the President said when the first stage of the Egyptian transition was completed -- again, it being the first stage, when President Mubarak left -- is that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the course of the last several decades is democratic transitions taking place in very different parts of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you had a democratic wave, if you will, in Latin America in the \xe2\x80\x9870s and \xe2\x80\x9880s.\xc2\xa0 You had democratic development in Southeast Asia and in Asia.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve had, of course, the dramatic democratic transitions in Eastern Europe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And part of the point here is that despite the difficulties associated with transitioning from a more authoritarian government to a democratic one, the world can look back and see many different models of successful transitions.\xc2\xa0 You see, of course, in other parts of the world, a country like Indonesia or the Philippines that was able to successfully transition from a more military-backed government to a more democratic one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, Chile demonstrated very successfully that despite the difficulties and despite the extraordinary challenges, it is possible for a country to undergo a transition that not only leads to a more democratic country but a more successful one -- one that enjoys greater economic growth, better relations with the world and the international community.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Brazil of course has a similar story.\xc2\xa0 And President Rousseff herself represents, in many respects, the success of that transition.\xc2\xa0 So I think it is something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your third question, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is, look, we understand that obviously China has a broad set of relationships around the world, as do we.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it needs to be a kind of zero-sum competition in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d put that aside in that respect.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d also say that we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s imperative that the United States not disengage from these regions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a cost to disengagement.\xc2\xa0 This has been a message I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered on why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been so focused on Asia, for instance, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true of Latin America, that when we disengage, our ability to advance partnerships that serve our interest suffers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of opportunity in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 These are growing economies.\xc2\xa0 These are dynamic societies.\xc2\xa0 These are countries that are on the rise in many respects.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s very much in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest, in the hemisphere\xe2\x80\x99s interest, for us to signal that we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to the region and that we not, again, **cede [see], again, our own hemisphere which is incredibly important to us in terms of, again, not taking advantage of the potential of those relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last part of that is that we also believe that we have -- and we said this, for instance, when we were in India -- we share values with these countries.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that these are democracies allows us to pursue a deeper relationship than we would be able to pursue with countries that aren\xe2\x80\x99t democracies.\xc2\xa0 Our exchanges and our engagement extends from governments to business to people-to-people.\xc2\xa0 And again, having a foundation of countries with whom you share not just interest and values I think allows for greater potential in the type of relationships that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to build.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In El Salvador, is the President going to talk about immigration?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s something like 1.5 million El Salvadoran immigrants in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s called on Congress to overhaul the immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Will he move the ball forward on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong connection between the El Salvadoran population in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That is something that, as the President noted when President Funes was here last year, is something that has benefited both countries.\xc2\xa0 And undoubtedly the issue of immigration and immigration policies will come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has made very clear his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform here, his desire and his outreach to both parties, to Republicans and Democrats alike, here to move the ball forward.\xc2\xa0 In discussing this with President Funes I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate that desire.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another important thing that President Funes underscored when he was here and has done so on a number of occasions, as other leaders have, as well, the importance of sustainable economic growth in countries like El Salvador and addressing citizen security issues in countries like El Salvador so that the Salvadoran people can live out their dreams in El Salvador.\xc2\xa0 That is important for El Salvador and would obviously have impacts on the immigration dynamic into the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that basket of issues will be part of the discussion between the two Presidents, where President Obama will underscore his commitment to moving forward to fix our broken system and his outreach to Republicans and Democrats alike in Congress to join him in addressing this important challenge that we face together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir, in the striped tie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is the last one, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wrap it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the nuclear cooperation agreement be signed or not in Chile?\xc2\xa0 Because yesterday the briefing didn\'t make it very clear.\xc2\xa0 And also whether there will be new funds for the Central America Security plan announced there.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 On Chile, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve answered.\xc2\xa0 The issue of cooperation on safety and security -- nuclear safety and security is part of the bilateral dialogue between the United States and Chile.\xc2\xa0 It will be part of the dialogue between the two Presidents next week in Santiago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to citizen security, we have made -- this President has made an enormous investment in a series of security partnerships in the Americas through the Merida Initiative with Mexico; through the Central America Regional Security Initiative -- CARSI-- in Central America; launching the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative -- CBSI -- at the Summit of the Americas with the countries of the Caribbean; continuing our cooperation with Colombia through CSDI -- the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those will be part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s message and how we work together with an increasing number of capable partners in the region to advance citizen security together -- again, not simply the U.S., the U.S. taking its responsibility, doing our part, but bringing others to the table to see how we can work on the issues of citizen security, particularly as they pertain to Central America, will be part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s discussion in all of this stops, not just his stop in San Salvador.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate your time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you here in a few hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 10:50 A.M.
