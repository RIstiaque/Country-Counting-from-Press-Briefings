GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, folks.\xc2\xa0 Is this working?\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 You recognize our special guest.\xc2\xa0 I want to turn this over to Vice President Biden.</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You act surprised.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see the reverence for the vice presidency still exists.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Hey, folks, I\xe2\x80\x99m here to talk about the Recovery Act, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that was the first thing on your mind this morning.\xc2\xa0 But very seriously, I think most of the skeptics have come around to the point that all the talk about the Recovery Act being dead on arrival and how it was going to be this great boondoggle and all the fraud and abuse that was going to occur and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to have much impact -- well, the fact is, the Recovery Act is working.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from hemorrhaging over 700,000 jobs a month the first several months we got here and turned on the lights in the West Wing here, to adding more several hundred thousand jobs a month the last several months.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from a GDP that was shrinking at 6.4 percent the first quarter we came into office to a GDP that grew 3 percent last quarter and averaged 4 percent over the last three quarters.</p>\n<p>And we believe, and so does most of the blue chip consensus reports out there, that this growth is going to be sustained at that 3 percent-plus range for the indefinite future.</p>\n<p>And so, again, from the intense skepticism and the doubt of many expressed 14 months ago, particularly some of the folks who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to vote for this legislation, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say there\xe2\x80\x99s general consensus among most economists that a significant portion of the growth in the GDP, as well as the job growth, is attributable to the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p>Thus far, we have allocated over $620 billion of the Act, and as a result, the Recovery Act is responsible for somewhere between 2.3 million and 2.8 million jobs that were either saved or created.</p>\n<p>So, folks, the Act is working.\xc2\xa0 And because the Recovery Act is working and has done all these things, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of folks, including some on Capitol Hill, who are of the view somehow that it\xe2\x80\x99s over; it worked and it must be finished.\xc2\xa0 The point of my talking to you today is that, although more people are going to be put to work this summer, the pace on the ball I talked about early on, the pace on the ball continues to increase, not decrease, as the Act rolls out in the final -- or this final summer.</p>\n<p>Last summer, we have 1,000 -- and these slides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you can read them, they\xe2\x80\x99re awfully small behind me -- but these slides show that we had 1,750 highway projects that were underway -- \xe2\x80\x9cshovel-ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 When the governors finally let the contracts and did it by the numbers, there were 1,750 projects underway.\xc2\xa0 This summer we\xe2\x80\x99ll be starting 10,000 projects that will be underway in the states.</p>\n<p>And as of Labor Day, of those 10,000 projects underway, 3,500 will be projects that are open to traffic, although not totally completed, and 500 will be totally completed, with 6,000 continuing to be completed and employing people through the fall.</p>\n<p>Last summer, we started improving just shy of 10,000 miles of highway in this country.\xc2\xa0 This summer, we\xe2\x80\x99ll start and ultimately improve 30,000 additional miles.</p>\n<p>Last summer, we started over 100 clean water and drinking water projects nationwide.\xc2\xa0 This summer, we will have underway 3,000 additional clean water projects.\xc2\xa0 And that means tens of thousands of more families in America will be able to be assured that their drinking water is safe when these projects are finished.</p>\n<p>Last summer, we weatherized under the weatherization program in the Act 3,000 American homes.\xc2\xa0 By the end of this summer, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have weatherized 82,000 additional homes.\xc2\xa0 And that translates into significant savings.\xc2\xa0 It means 82,000 families out there will be saving on average 400 bucks a year on their energy bills that they would not have otherwise been able to save.\xc2\xa0 And it means jobs.\xc2\xa0 It means jobs of people doing the weatherization.\xc2\xa0 It means jobs that accrue from the additional $400 savings that now goes back into the economy, keeping open the neighborhood lunch counter, as well as the movie theater and the hardware store.</p>\n<p>And that means that this summer, a lot more people are going to be working on highways, building clean water projects, weatherizing homes, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be drawing paychecks that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have otherwise drawn.\xc2\xa0 And that means a lot more money, again, into the local economies.</p>\n<p>Economists tend to measure these things in terms of the actual job that is, in fact, created.\xc2\xa0 But the truth is that job created means money spent in the community means someone stays employed -- someone out there is actually working.\xc2\xa0 And it means a lot more lunch breaks at the local diner because there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any lunch breaks, there weren\xe2\x80\x99t the jobs that existed; and a lot more trips to the barbershop, to the movies, to the department store -- helping those businesses they go to maintain their employment base and increase their employment base.</p>\n<p>So the ripple effects have been felt thus far since the Recovery Act passed.\xc2\xa0 But my point is, this summer you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see even more ripple effect out there.\xc2\xa0 This is the -- the Act is now -- as I said, the pace on the ball is moving into its highest gear here in terms of direct investment in projects.</p>\n<p>So, again, don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, private companies across the country are hiring people.\xc2\xa0 You can go to recovery.gov -- which I know many of you have and you probably do that in your leisure time, wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to second-guess, which you should, whether or not what we\xe2\x80\x99re asserting is correct, look at the filings.\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, recovery.gov; check it out for yourself.\xc2\xa0 The illustration behind me just takes four of the 10,000 Recovery Act reports on specific projects.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an illustration, but there are 10,000 ones just like -- 10,000 reports just like the one behind me.\xc2\xa0 And these reports will tell you two things:\xc2\xa0 how much money the outfit got, what they spent it on and how many people they hired to get the project done.</p>\n<p>And so, folks, these reports show that in just a three-month period -- January, February and March of this year -- approximately -- slightly under 680,000 jobs -- you can count, put a name to, look at who it was, where it was, what they did -- roughly 680,000 jobs were created.</p>\n<p>And the other point I keep making to my colleagues in running this recovery operation is that much of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here, much of what the Recovery Act is doing, we should be doing if we were growing at 10 percent, if we had full employment.\xc2\xa0 The infrastructure in this country needs help.\xc2\xa0 It increases productivity; it increases safety; it increases the safety from -- on the highway to the drinking water to providing access for a lot of people -- a lot of other means.</p>\n<p>So another important point I\xe2\x80\x99d like to make here is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach some fairly important milestones this summer in terms of goals that we set.\xc2\xa0 The President tomorrow is going to travel out to Columbus, Ohio, for the groundbreaking of the 10,000th Recovery Act road project -- the 10,000th road project.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nAnd, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around a long time in public life -- I was a senator for six full terms -- and I tell you, people back home know whether or not the guys in the corner with a hard hat on, putting in a crosswalk or building a four-lane highway, whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re working.\xc2\xa0 They understand there\xe2\x80\x99s activity.\xc2\xa0 They know whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s real.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of real, positive things happening in people\xe2\x80\x99s communities that are improving their quality of life, and these road projects are among them.</p>\n<p>On June 30th, we will have built, expanded or renovated 1,100 community health care centers.\xc2\xa0 Now, I know some of you have traveled with me and with others.\xc2\xa0 Go into these communities, rural or in the municipal areas, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that they are gems -- the public and the people in those neighborhoods desperately need them and rely on them.\xc2\xa0 And the bottom line here is, there are 2.5 million people who weren\xe2\x80\x99t having access to regular health care that have access to it now as a consequence of those investments in over 1,100 rural and urban community health centers.</p>\n<p>In August, there will be an additional 100 -- excuse me, 1 million homes that will have smart meters attached to them.\xc2\xa0 Now, you know, when you say \xe2\x80\x9csmart meter\xe2\x80\x9d to the average person, they go, what are you talking about?\xc2\xa0 A smart meter just lets you be able to know and regulate the consumption of your energy so on balance it\xe2\x80\x99s considerably cheaper.\xc2\xa0 It will tell you how much energy you are using, when you\xe2\x80\x99re using your dishwasher, when you\xe2\x80\x99re using your hot water heater, when you\xe2\x80\x99re kicking it up.</p>\n<p>So these are real savings, real long-term investments.\xc2\xa0 And we are on path to meet our goal of making sure that, in the United States of America, we end up with over -- I believe the number is close to 18,000 -- actually, 18 million smart meter -- excuse me, misspoke.\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, 18 million smart meters by 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this has multiple consequences -- not just in saving money, but it also has consequences in terms of reducing energy consumption, dealing with the environment, importation of foreign oil, et cetera.</p>\n<p>In August of this year, because of the weatherization projects that are underway, there will be more than 200,000 homeowners -- 200,000 new homeowners -- that will be saving $400 a year on average in their energy bill.\xc2\xa0 And to real people, that\xe2\x80\x99s real money.\xc2\xa0 That matters.</p>\n<p>And the last slide I have behind me here shows that the Recovery Act is already responsible for up to 2,800,000 jobs -- low as 2,002 [sic] in the estimates, but somewhere, if you average it out to be, just take the average, about 2.5 million jobs saved or created.\xc2\xa0 Or put another way:\xc2\xa0 2.5 million people who would not be working today but for the existence of the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p>And so we\xe2\x80\x99re on track, as the graph shows, to meeting the commitment I made when we announced this of creating or saving 3.5 million jobs by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>And so we know there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to be done.\xc2\xa0 The economic crisis that we inherited -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s our responsibility, it\xe2\x80\x99s not we inherited it, therefore it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we inherited an economic crisis.\xc2\xa0 But it turned out to be deeper than we knew or most of the econometric models showed, most of the blue chip estimates.\xc2\xa0 It was deeper and it was more profound than we thought.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, the President would kid early on, he\xe2\x80\x99d say, we bought in too high.\xc2\xa0 You know, if we had been sworn in March the 20th like the old days back in the \xe2\x80\x9830s, it would have been clearer just how bad this was before we took over.</p>\n<p>But the truth of the matter is that while there was a consensus among the experts that we\xe2\x80\x99re now in a recovery or recovering, we don\xe2\x80\x99t measure success by the growth in GDP.\xc2\xa0 That is necessary but not sufficient.\xc2\xa0 We set out -- we ran together for these jobs, we said, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to measure success based upon whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s growth in the middle class, those people aspiring to the middle class have a fighting chance to get there, and those who get there have a fighting chance to stay there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from that yet.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a long way.</p>\n<p>But the assertion I\xe2\x80\x99m making today is there is no doubt that the economic policy we put in place in this Recovery Act is helping us move in that direction.\xc2\xa0 And that means that, though, in the meantime, we can\xe2\x80\x99t let up.\xc2\xa0 We have to continue to invest in job creation; continue to support small business, which is the engine of job creation; and continue to help states and localities who remain under extreme difficult constraints.</p>\n<p>I -- as most of you know, you get bored to death having to watch me do this initially, but I\xe2\x80\x99m on the phone every week with somewhere between four and seven governors, depending on -- both parties -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve now spoken to every governor I think -- probably there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some exception -- every governor at least twice so far, going into great detail about their use of this money -- how are they using it, are they using it wisely, what do they need -- and responding to them.</p>\n<p>I have spoken to well over 140 mayors and county execs.\xc2\xa0 I do this once a week for a couple hours -- an hour each with them.\xc2\xa0 And privately every single one of them have thanked me for the Act.\xc2\xa0 But one of the things they\xe2\x80\x99ve all said -- every one of them -- you think my situation is bad in 2010, Mr. Vice President, it\xe2\x80\x99s worse in 2011.</p>\n<p>So when we talk about total government investment in the economy, total government -- state, local and federal -- there is a real shortfall that\xe2\x80\x99s going to exist among the states and municipalities this year.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why a lot of folks ask why do we think we need to continue to have some counter-cyclical help for the states and localities -- because essential services, teachers, cops, firefighters, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be laying an awful lot of those folks off.\xc2\xa0 It not only has an economic impact on the community, it has a societal impact in terms of the public safety and the attitude about that community about themselves when you lay that many people off.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the Recovery Act is working, but -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to work.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not over.\xc2\xa0 A lot is going to happen this summer.\xc2\xa0 And even after this summer, there\xe2\x80\x99s more to come with the Act, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about another time, because as we continue to lay down the building blocks for a new economy, the thesis we\xe2\x80\x99ve operated on, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sufficient to lead the world in the 21st century by rebuilding the economy of the 20th century that collapsed on the last administration\xe2\x80\x99s watch.\xc2\xa0 We need to invest in new platforms to maintain our economic superiority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to invest in these broadband projects, bringing us in line with more -- you\xe2\x80\x99d think we\xe2\x80\x99re the most advanced nation in the world, yet we\xe2\x80\x99re way behind an awful lot of other countries.\xc2\xa0 That goes to productivity.\xc2\xa0 It goes to job creation.\xc2\xa0 We also are going to continue to invest in solar and wind projects of consequence; new battery and electric vehicle plants, expanding operations and rolling new products off their lines; and new organizations set up to transition all those paper records in your doctors\xe2\x80\x99 offices to computerized records, saving lives, saving money, creating jobs, and impacting on reducing the long-term debt.</p>\n<p>And so this is just the tip of it.\xc2\xa0 These projects continue to happen across the United States, across all industries, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to put Americans back to work and help us move to a new and stronger future.</p>\n<p>And with that, I will, as they say, yield the floor, in old Senate parlance, and take some questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the stimulus is working, sir, why is unemployment at 9.7 percent when you predicted it would be 7.5 right now?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, because every other major econometric model predicted the same thing, that we thought that unemployment wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go much above 8 percent.\xc2\xa0 My point in my statement was this recession was so much deeper, so much more profound than anyone -- most people thought it was.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The bottom line is -- you can look at it two ways.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the old half empty, half full.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, unemployment is unacceptably high.\xc2\xa0 We knew that the hole dug by the recession that was created by the policies of the last administration resulted in a loss, a real loss of somewhere between $2 trillion and $3 trillion in the economy.\xc2\xa0 We never thought that $787 billion was going to fill those holes -- that hole.\xc2\xa0 The purpose of it was to keep people from falling into the abyss, keep us from sliding into a literal depression, and begin to build a ladder to climb out of that hole.</p>\n<p>But, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s to stimulate economic growth, because the only engine that\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring us back to total health is the free enterprise system and the American -- free enterprise system and the business community.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here is we\xe2\x80\x99re building circumstances where their competence is increasing, their ability to continue to borrow, make money, expand is able, and ultimately this is going to catch on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to fill that hole only after the free enterprise system is able to kick in because of the corrections we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you recognize folks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Vice President, the May jobs report was very disappointing for private sector job creation.\xc2\xa0 Now, the Recovery Act is all about encouraging the private sector to boost hiring.\xc2\xa0 Do you see any evidence in June that the private sector is doing better?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the private sector -- if we -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency when we\xe2\x80\x99re in a circumstance where the unemployment is so unacceptably high, when so many people are out of work -- my grandpop used to have an expression; he said -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a suburb of Scranton, Pennsylvania, called Dalton -- he said, when the guy up in Dalton is out of work it\xe2\x80\x99s an economic slowdown; when your brother-in-law is out of work it\xe2\x80\x99s a recession; when you\xe2\x80\x99re out of work it\xe2\x80\x99s a depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s still a depression for millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still a depression.\xc2\xa0 And -- but what is clear is when you\xe2\x80\x99re in that -- you tend to look at every -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like taking your blood pressure every hour.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s looking at every single solitary little change that takes place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look at it over a longer term.\xc2\xa0 In the first five months of last year we lost 3 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 The first five months of this year we created almost 500,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before and I say it again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to create jobs on a monthly basis.\xc2\xa0 It will be up and down, but the path is going to continue to be strong, sustaining a growth rate as predicted of over 3 percent -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the consensus -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to push until we get to the point where the economic recovery really takes hold because business and the free enterprise system has decided that it\xe2\x80\x99s ready to really invest again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just follow on that, do you still think that the Recovery Act will be responsible for 90 percent -- that 90 percent of the jobs will be private sector in hiring?\xc2\xa0 Or will you revise that in light of recent jobs numbers?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think that it will be perilously close to 90 percent -- the vast bulk.\xc2\xa0 Look, last --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even with last month\xe2\x80\x99s job report, where -</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it -- that\xe2\x80\x99s who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just remember, too, the census isn\xe2\x80\x99t part of -- the census is a mandated, 10-year project.\xc2\xa0 The census, which was responsible for a number of the government jobs that are created on a monthly basis in order to take that census, were not part of the recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re now $62 million into spending this and you guys are nowhere near 90 percent in terms of jobs being created in the private sector.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re sticking with it, then I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re sticking with it.\xc2\xa0 I just want an explanation --</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Look, the vast majority of those 2.2 million to 2.8 million jobs have not been census jobs.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have been jobs that saved teachers\xe2\x80\x99 jobs and cops.\xc2\xa0 So you argue -- you can argue they are not private sector jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 So the truth of the matter is that jobs that are private sector jobs are going to make up the vast bulk of the jobs created by this Act.\xc2\xa0 But a significant portion of the jobs also are saving those jobs that otherwise would have caused chaos in communities had they been lost -- teachers, cops and firefighters.\xc2\xa0 That does both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Vice President, on February 25th of 2009, right after the Recovery Act was passed, you said, this literally dropkicks us out of the recession.\xc2\xa0 By that definition, by those words you said right after it passed, has this worked?\xc2\xa0 Have we been dropkicked out of a recession?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have.\xc2\xa0 Now, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the technical argument of economists of when the recession officially ends or will end.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that what I meant then -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it now -- we have turned this economy around.\xc2\xa0 Instead of falling off the abyss, it is on firm ground.\xc2\xa0 It is heading in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 And every aspect of the economy is growing.</p>\n<p>Is it growing as fast as we want it to grow?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Has it -- is it able to wipe out 8 million jobs lost as a consequence of the recession which we inherited?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 But it has turned the country around.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 And this is the basis upon which this full recovery over time is going to occur.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Vice President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s to go Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Vice President, thank you -- thank you for being here, but you say that economists, there\xe2\x80\x99s a general consensus -- mayors, governors, all the people you talk to, there\xe2\x80\x99s a consensus -- but is there a disconnect with the American people?\xc2\xa0 And I know polls are not the be-all and end-all, but four times in our CBS/New York Times poll we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked people if the stimulus has created a substantial number of jobs -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done it for a few months, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s changed dramatically since then -- the numbers saying, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, a substantial number of jobs\xe2\x80\x9d has been 4 percent, 7 percent, 6 percent, 6 percent.\xc2\xa0 That is just appallingly low.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also totally understandable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s totally, completely understandable.\xc2\xa0 Look, the kitchen table I grew up in Claymont, Delaware, no one sat around and was able to make a distinction between, if that existed at the time, between bailing out the banks, TARP, between a funding program that was designed called the America Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\xc2\xa0 All they knew is whether or not there were more people being hired at Worth Steel.\xc2\xa0 All they knew was where they were going to build a new Food Fair across from Holy Rosary School and it was going to create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Well, guess what?\xc2\xa0 In Claymont, Delaware, and the Claymont, Delawares of the country, it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to happen.\xc2\xa0 At Claymont, Delaware, and Claymont, Delawares of America, they\xe2\x80\x99re no longer laying off in big numbers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s stabilized.\xc2\xa0 The bottom is hit.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re hearing people are going back.\xc2\xa0 They hired back some folks at; the General Motors plant has now been bought by; it\xe2\x80\x99s now producing more cars; the following -- that\xe2\x80\x99s how people measure what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in their lives.</p>\n<p>Again, I may have sat at a different kind of kitchen table than you all did.\xc2\xa0 I never heard anybody in my family and their family members worried about losing jobs -- \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, the GDP was up by,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you only created public sector jobs\xe2\x80\x9d -- it\xe2\x80\x99s real simple.\xc2\xa0 The measurement is, is it feeling better?\xc2\xa0 Am I more confident?\xc2\xa0 Can I go, instead of getting my hair cut every seven weeks, can I go back to getting it done once a week -- or, I mean, once a month or once every three weeks?\xc2\xa0 Can I take a vacation?\xc2\xa0 Am I going to buy this car?\xc2\xa0 Do I feel better I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be able to make my mortgage payment?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in America.</p>\n<p>And they do not associate that with -- nor would I expect to them to -- nor would I -- \xe2\x80\x9cthat was the Recovery Act who created those jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Now, I hate to say this but there was another competing network\xe2\x80\x99s poll that I saw -- which I think a single poll makes no sense at all, by the way.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not making -- but if you -- dueling polls, showing that something -- only 25 percent of the American people roughly thought the American Recovery Act was not working, a slightly larger number thought it was working, and the rest didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>I mean, look, folks, that old expression, the proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s real simple, man.\xc2\xa0 It really is basic.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find out every month whether the American people feel better about their circumstance, feel more secure in the job they have, feel more hopeful about getting a job, and are able to continue to send their kids back to college in September, being able to make sure they can pay their bills.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the measure.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a question on another important topic, given your knowledge of the Senate, what do you think the outlook is for a comprehensive energy bill and particularly for a cap and trade --</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Look, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing I learned after 36 years in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 Anybody who thinks they can predict what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen the next week in the United States Senate probably never served in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>Look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get an energy bill.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get an energy bill that\xe2\x80\x99s real.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard.\xc2\xa0 The House has already passed a really good bill.\xc2\xa0 And I think that this is one of those -- you know, I used to joke when I was a senator and some of you who covered the Senate remember these kinds of phrases, I used to say, they say, well -- you know, I\xe2\x80\x99d say, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 This is going to pass.\xc2\xa0 Well, how do you know?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you when the horses smell the water.\xc2\xa0 I mean there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear consensus out there, guys, that something has to be done on the energy side.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a clear knowledge and understanding on the part of all the folks up there in the Hill that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do something to deal with the amount of carbon that we emit into the air and the amount of oil we consume from abroad.</p>\n<p>And so based on the fact the House has already acted, and there are serious people like John Kerry and others working on coming up with a Senate bill, I believe that there is a clear possibility we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a solid bill.\xc2\xa0 But beyond putting odds on it, it\xe2\x80\x99s just very hard to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden, you said this is pretty much basic, and you said there\xe2\x80\x99s still millions of Americans who believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re in a depression still.\xc2\xa0 Do you -- with that, do you believe there should be targeted approaches for minorities, particularly African Americans, as well as Hispanics and even teens, when it comes to the unemployment rate?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And also, on another subject, what are your thoughts about Mr. Barton\xe2\x80\x99s comments this morning?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, since you know I never say what\xe2\x80\x99s on my mind -- (laughter) -- I probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on Mr. Barton\xe2\x80\x99s comment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, come on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it that bad?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging me, what can I say?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, okay, you should --</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Look, look -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How big of a deal was it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Thank God my mother wasn\xe2\x80\x99t around.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, guys, I find it incredibly insensitive, incredibly out of touch.\xc2\xa0 The reason why I got involved in politics, the reason why the President and I ran, the President got involved, is the one primary role for government is to protect people who are being taken advantage of; protect people who are in an extreme straits and not able to take care of the circumstances themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve been down in the bayou area off and on for the last 36 years.\xc2\xa0 My daughter went down to Tulane -- I was worried she was not going to come home.\xc2\xa0 I think I know the area relatively well as an outsider.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an entire way of life in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 This is just not about jobs.\xc2\xa0 This is just not about whether or not the waterfowl is polluted and you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- this is an entire way of life that\xe2\x80\x99s in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 And to sit there and say that we\xe2\x80\x99re being -- in effect, as I understood the statement -- that he was ashamed we\xe2\x80\x99re being tough on an oil company who caused the problem -- I mean, I -- look, I just think that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty important to the people of Louisiana all the way through Florida and even in his home state of Texas that people disassociate themselves from that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s not the role -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no shakedown.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s insisting on responsible conduct and a responsible response to something they caused.\xc2\xa0 And I find it outrageous to suggest that if, in fact, we insisted that BP demonstrate their preparedness, to put aside billions of dollars -- in this case, $20 billion -- to take care of the immediate needs of people who are drowning -- these guys don\xe2\x80\x99t have deep pockets.\xc2\xa0 The guy who runs the local marina, the guy who has one shrimping boat, the guy who has one small business -- he can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose $10,000, $12,000, $15,000, $30,000 a month.</p>\n<p>And so the thing the President did -- and I was so proud of him -- is when we had the meeting with BP -- and they were cooperative in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 They were cooperative.\xc2\xa0 He said, look, what I want you to do is take care of those people now who, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get help now, are going to be under, gone.\xc2\xa0 Gone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I might add, this fund is not a ceiling, and people can go back to it as many times as they can prove they have been damaged and they need help.\xc2\xa0 And the cleanup costs are all BP\xe2\x80\x99s costs, separate, apart and above that $20 billion.</p>\n<p>What is wrong with that?\xc2\xa0 How is that a shakedown?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I find it pretty astounding, the comment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on targeted approaches, sir -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the first part of my question.</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, a lot of this, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve already done has had a targeted approach.\xc2\xa0 You start off and take a look at what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with focusing on unemployment, COBRA; what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in terms of FMAP -- excuse me, I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to sound like a wonk -- FMAP, meaning be able to help states and communities keep available Medicaid for people; the bulk of these -- a significant portion of these construction jobs; and significant portion of the weatherization programs and public housing -- an awful lot of this is, in fact, benefiting the people who you describe.</p>\n<p>The people hurt most in the construction industry have been Hispanics, and this is -- a big chunk of this is in the Hispanic -- in effect, is construction and rehiring an awful lot of those people.</p>\n<p>But the truth of the matter is there continues to be a real disparity between the unemployment rate before this happened and subsequent to it happening between minorities and the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 And I might add -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to think this is totally unrelated, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we invested over $100 billion of the Recovery Act in education -- early education, in a Race to the Top, in improving the quality of education -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s an investment that has to be made.</p>\n<p>Let me conclude by saying, look, I mean this sincerely.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the average American is prepared to settle for this country being second in anything.\xc2\xa0 And they know, in order for us to be the economic engine of the world and to lead the world again, we have to make a fundamental change in our education policy, our health care policy, and our energy policy.\xc2\xa0 There is no way out.\xc2\xa0 There is no way we can lead the world without those changes.</p>\n<p>And part of this Act -- which I\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming back and talk to you about later -- lays down the building blocks for a new energy policy, for a new education policy, as well as for a new health care policy -- or the completion of the health care policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t call on her I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be in trouble -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just had a question about the unemployment measure in the Senate that\xe2\x80\x99s been stuck because people are worried about the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Do you think if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass it could actually stall the recovery?\xc2\xa0 And what do you do to convince people that the deficit shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be first and foremost in people\xe2\x80\x99s minds right now?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll make two points, briefly as I can.\xc2\xa0 One, this is not a time to take -- to use the metaphor -- take our foot off the accelerator here.\xc2\xa0 We still need to continue to create jobs and spur job growth now.</p>\n<p>We are in consultation with Chairman Baucus now as to what kind of compromise we can put together in what was roughly $140 billion bill, and with about $55 billion in pay-fors.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the process now of trying to negotiate a compromise to get -- we got 52 votes, but as you know, a majority no longer rules in the United States Senate, so you need 60.\xc2\xa0 In the old days that would have been enough, you know, 52.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we think we can put together a compromise that will continue -- won\xe2\x80\x99t be all we ask for -- but will continue to spur job growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the larger question -- and maybe this is the best way -- on the larger question of deficits versus job creation and stimulus, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an important point that it\xe2\x80\x99s understandably -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not being a wise guy when I say this -- understandably difficult to sort of -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not intuitively arrived at.</p>\n<p>The American Recovery Act, which is over $787 billion, added less than one-half of 1 percent -- less than one-half of 1 percent -- of deficit to GDP by the year 2012.\xc2\xa0 These one-off projects, the one-time projects of short-term deficit spending have virtually no impact on what we really have to attend to:\xc2\xa0 the long-term debt, the accumulated debt.</p>\n<p>And so it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable why people say, look, we want you to spend, in emergency spending, $50 billion or $60 billion to continue to spur growth, and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that having much of an impact on long-term debt.\xc2\xa0 And that is an economic fact of life, but is a politically difficult issue.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what leadership is about.\xc2\xa0 Leadership is about making the right decisions based on what the facts are, even at the time when they\xe2\x80\x99re viewed to be unpopular.</p>\n<p>And so my hope is that my colleagues will make those distinctions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing than saying, by the way, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to increase -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to initiate a new entitlement program and not pay for it, or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to raise everyone\xe2\x80\x99s salary 5 percent and forever.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they do have gigantic impacts on the long-term debt.</p>\n<p>So, that\xe2\x80\x99s the deal.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, thank you for having me, and -- thanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How\xe2\x80\x99s your son doing, sir?</p>\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s doing great.\xc2\xa0 He goes back to work the end of the month and he is -- he\xe2\x80\x99s in great shape.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m really excited, thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing about yesterday.\xc2\xa0 In the meetings, did BP ask for the President to make the comments that he did about the importance of a strong and viable BP?\xc2\xa0 Was that a request from the company?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in there the whole time.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think everybody -- as the President said, everybody in the country, everybody in the Gulf, has as interest in a company that\xe2\x80\x99s able to uphold its responsibilities, particularly the ones that they outlined yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the company is saying, this would be important for us?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the -- going back to the speech Tuesday night when the President talked about a Gulf Coast restoration plan, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really explain what that would mean.\xc2\xa0 Is this a government program?\xc2\xa0 How much money are we talking about?\xc2\xa0 What kinds of -- what sort of scope does this have?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Governor Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy -- former Governor Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, is here and will see the President -- may have already seen him, I think.\xc2\xa0 The President has tasked the Secretary to develop and devise a process for a long-term Gulf restoration plan that includes all of the stakeholders -- states, local communities, Gulf Coast residents, a whole host of -- those that have significant equities in the environment and the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One of the things that is not covered in the economic claims are the natural resource damage assessments that will be done on the Gulf environment.\xc2\xa0 And BP is liable for those damage assessments.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that will be the basis for a lot of the restoration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So BP funded \xe2\x80\x93- basically the government --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, those are -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t close off anything.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s the beginning of a process that will take some time.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume and safe to say that recovery for the Gulf will take years.\xc2\xa0 But the basis for -- the basis for that will be those NRDAs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think when people in the region heard him talk about that, they took it to mean something bigger than just let\xe2\x80\x99s think about what this oil --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a topic that people talk about down there for a long time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t foreclose that that will be part of it.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into what we would fund based on the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a process right now going forward to create that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t established parameters, in other words?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the parameters that he roughly laid out in the speech was to leave the Gulf in a place that was better than it was prior to this accident.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and then just really quickly, you just mentioned about the natural resources degradation being a separate liability for BP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was some confusion about this yesterday because both in the fact sheets from here and the statements that BP was putting out --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I know where you\xe2\x80\x99re going --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it looked like the fund was supposed to be paying for that stuff as well.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The fund can -- let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to -- because I think I knew where you were going.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s $20 billion that\xe2\x80\x99s set aside as a minimum for economic claims.\xc2\xa0 As we said yesterday, and as you heard the Vice President reiterate, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a cap.\xc2\xa0 So if the economic damages are more, then BP is liable for that amount.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s say, for instance, those economic damages were $15 billion -- that $5 billion left over could go to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The environmental work --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- could go for the natural resources assessments if all the economic claims are covered.\xc2\xa0 But it is not two pots of money that compete against each other.\xc2\xa0 The prioritization in the escrow fund are for the economic losses -- loss of income, loss of jobs for individuals and small businesses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to come back to the remarks on the Hill, the shakedown.\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you think -- or does the White House think there\xe2\x80\x99s any risk of alienating businesses by dragging BP up here for hauling over the coals?\xc2\xa0 And also, the Congressman\xe2\x80\x99s remarks sort of raised the question of the legality.\xc2\xa0 I mean, could you have stepped over a constitutional boundary?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, they\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for -- let me be clear, they\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for the economic loss that happened in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they agreed to pay into.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no constitutional problem.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to add to what the Vice President said.\xc2\xa0 I think he was very clear on this.\xc2\xa0 I think Republicans are going to have to ask themselves whether Congressman Barton should be the ranking member of a committee that\xe2\x80\x99s doing what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing today, given the fact that he believes we owe an apology to BP, rather than BP owing an apology to the Gulf.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) for him to resign?\xc2\xa0 Step down?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will let Republicans make that decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You usually don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on things like that, though, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Why take this particular opportunity?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly pointed comment about the notion of whether or not BP is going to be responsible for the damage that they\xe2\x80\x99ve caused.\xc2\xa0 The President and the Vice President believe so.\xc2\xa0 I think the people in the Gulf believe so.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Barton, who, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand, is the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, apparently believes -- and did so by apologizing to BP.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a disqualifier, in your mind, in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s mind --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s going to oversee -- as we look into what the company is doing, to begin by apologizing to the company, I think is an interesting way to start.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on -- Congressman Barton seemed to raise a question about the propriety of having the Attorney General in the room yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Just on that narrow point, are you concerned --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not at all, not at all.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s understand that there were -- the President, the Vice President and the relevant Cabinet agencies -- the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to go around the room -- the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss some -- Commerce was there -- they\xe2\x80\x99re the relevant agencies that have purview over what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as I think we said pretty clearly yesterday, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a -- this was not a discussion about what happened that night on the rig, whether or not they cut corners, took shortcuts, tried to take the cheap way out -- none of that was discussed.\xc2\xa0 And those Cabinet members were in there only for the first 20 minutes with what the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Secretary of Commerce does not have an open criminal investigation of this company --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the Secretary --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question was, they had that hanging over their head and had the Attorney General --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the Secretary of Commerce has within it NOAA, which closes the Gulf to fishing and affects those that earn their living --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Attorney General has an open criminal investigation, he\xe2\x80\x99s sitting across the table from them -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that make them more likely to be willing to write a $20 billion check?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On containment, on Tuesday morning, I think you said on \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America\xe2\x80\x9d that more than 90 percent of the oil would be contained by the end of June.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I said in the coming weeks, or end of June, right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it was in response to a question that said end of June.\xc2\xa0 Do you still stand behind that?\xc2\xa0 Because how do we really know how much oil is in the Gulf when the numbers keep changing about how much is spewing into the Gulf?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s 90 percent of what?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, 90 percent of what\xe2\x80\x99s coming out right now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we -- our containment strategy is based on what\xe2\x80\x99s coming out of the leaking well as you and I speak, Ed.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s understand that the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just 90 percent of, say, 60,000 barrels if that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s coming out per day?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Up to 60,000 barrels.\xc2\xa0 The flow rate group, using new information and pressure readings -- Secretary Chu asked and directed BP to take pressure monitor readings from inside their two top vents inside the top cap itself.\xc2\xa0 He knows what the pressure is outside of that; by measuring the pressure inside of that, you get a far better scientific conclusion as to the amount that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out.</p>\n<p>We know what\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the top from the top cap.\xc2\xa0 And that allows you to make as best a scientific assessment as you can, understanding, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said, that we are estimating a flow rate for something we cannot see or touch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of containment right now, the top cap is drawing oil and gas to the surface to -- from the LMR -- the lower marine riser cap to the Enterprise.\xc2\xa0 The Q4000 came online yesterday, and I should have an estimate -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an estimate later in the day about the rate at which going through the choke and kill line and off of a device that was set up for the top kill procedure, using those lines to direct oil to the surface, that adds an additional approximately 5,000 to 10,000 barrels to our containment strategy.</p>\n<p>By the end of June -- and, again, I think you guys have seen all of our correspondence with BP directing them to move forward more quickly with a containment strategy -- there is a riser that\xe2\x80\x99s being fabricated now that will be hooked to another vessel that will increase by the end of June 40,000 t0 53,000 barrels per day.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there are additional containment strategies by the middle of July that would take that figure to the capacity of 60,000 to 80,000 barrels a day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing, Secretary Mabus, is he planning to step down as Secretary of the Navy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be a full-time job, the Gulf recovery?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President talked to the governor about this and they both agreed that he had the ability to do both.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I know there was some review early on with the EPA regarding the dispersant.\xc2\xa0 I just wonder, at this point, is the administration comfortable with the amount of dispersant that is being released into the Gulf?\xc2\xa0 And are you comfortable with the substance itself?\xc2\xa0 Because a lot of marine biologists that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to say that this is a very toxic chemical, that this could actually be more harmful to wildlife in the Gulf than the oil itself.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the scientific basis for that is.\xc2\xa0 I think far and away the most harmful substance that is being emitted into the environment in the Gulf is the oil.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why to clean the beaches, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wear a hazardous materials suit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The EPA early on -- and I think you probably have a copy of the directive -- I think the number was to reduce by 75 percent the amount of both surface and subsea dispersants that were being used.\xc2\xa0 NOAA continues -- as does EPA -- continues to do water sampling of -- in and around the areas of the Gulf to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re accurately monitoring the health and safety of the Gulf and anybody involved in working.</p>\n<p>We were concerned about and remain concerned about the sheer amount of dispersants that have had to be used.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the EPA came through with a directive to significantly reduce the amount that we emit into the environment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think at the current quantity it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to release that dispersant into the water?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that -- yes, we believe that the dispersant that\xe2\x80\x99s being used at the amount that it\xe2\x80\x99s being used at now is safe, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This particular chemical, this Corexit, as it\xe2\x80\x99s called -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s patented, scientists are not able to see the actual formula of what this is, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it.\xc2\xa0 Is there any move to try and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, how does the marine biologist say that it\xe2\x80\x99s more toxic?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, given the studies that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done based on what\xe2\x80\x99s happened on Alaska, they say -- they call it Corexit in Alaska, but they also call it \xe2\x80\x9cHidesit,\xe2\x80\x9d because it essentially hides it from the surface of the water and pushes all the chemicals underneath.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is the purpose, but it keeps it in the water.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- right, the dispersant -- well, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got something we can put in the water that takes the oil out, I\xe2\x80\x99m -- come see me and Bill right after this because we should sign you up.\xc2\xa0 You add this -- you add -- we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this for the first time at a subsea level.\xc2\xa0 And April asked a question of Admiral Allen about this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The point is not to have it accumulate on the surface and allow it to spread either onto beaches or into marshes.\xc2\xa0 At that depth, it can biodegrade more quickly, which is exactly what you want the oil to do.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the $20 billion not being a cap, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop BP four years from now, after they\xe2\x80\x99ve contributed the full $20 billion, from saying, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all we\xe2\x80\x99re giving; if you want more, take us to court?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly would retain the right to do something like that.\xc2\xa0 We --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s up to them whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a cap, right?\xc2\xa0 And they could declare at any point it\xe2\x80\x99s a cap.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this, Chip.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that we need Congress to do -- and Senator Menendez from New Jersey tried today again to get consent for the Senate to move forward on lifting the liability cap that\xe2\x80\x99s in the Oil Pollution Act.\xc2\xa0 Right now we know it\xe2\x80\x99s $75 million; obviously what BP has pledged greatly exceeds the $75 million.\xc2\xa0 But we need that -- for our own purposes, we need that cap to be lifted.</p>\n<p>We will continue to monitor the claims process and direct BP with whatever they need to do.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have -- as part of the deal, we have some collateral.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the oil rig workers, you\xe2\x80\x99ve stated very clearly, and I think other administration officials have, too, that the administration believed that BP was legally responsible for compensating oil rig workers who are out of work because of the moratorium.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Carol Browner said, well, there are legal issues here.\xc2\xa0 Where does that stand now?\xc2\xa0 Are you backing off your position?\xc2\xa0 And is that because BP said you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking into the legal issues.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the things that is tremendously important out of yesterday was a $100 million commitment for those rig workers --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but that was not a legal obligation.\xc2\xa0 That was a goodwill gesture.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it was.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- it was one that was part of what we worked out yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the comments you\xe2\x80\x99ve made in this room before saying that BP is legally responsible, is that null and void at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said a minute ago, Chip, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking into any of the any of the legal issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re backing off the affirmative statement that you made?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just say we\xe2\x80\x99re looking into the legal --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you been in the President\xe2\x80\x99s presence when he either heard about or responded to the Joe Barton comments?\xc2\xa0 And what did he say?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I briefed him on them earlier and he shook his head and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why anybody would say something like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he say anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he said, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why anybody would say that.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shakedowns aside, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true that BP essentially didn\xe2\x80\x99t fight the $20 billion fund?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- let me -- I want to disassociate the premise of your question from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 Yes, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize how they came to the meeting yesterday.\xc2\xa0 They have said and we have put into place an assurance that the economic damages that have been caused will be compensated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 BP essentially has laid down many of its legal rights voluntarily.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that they -- yes, again, the cap that I spoke about with Chip a minute ago, I think would be exceeded -- well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve given states money to advertise for tourism in the four affected states that exceeds the $75 million cap in and of itself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just bottom line, they\xe2\x80\x99re not really fighting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a BP spokesperson.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that -- I will characterize -- let me characterize it this way, we did not give up the ability to do the natural resource damage assessments and give them the bill.\xc2\xa0 Nobody gave up anything in terms of them paying for the cleanup costs that they\xe2\x80\x99re liable for.\xc2\xa0 There was no discussion about anything involving -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ll get a bill for this -- the penalty for the pollution that\xe2\x80\x99s been emitted into the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And all we did for claimants was add to their ability to appeal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that it\xe2\x80\x99s in certainly BP\xe2\x80\x99s interest but also the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest for BP to stay solvent and not go into bankruptcy, as that would imperil the ability of victims to get their recovery.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p><br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It would, but I would say this.\xc2\xa0 The important -- one of the important parts of the -- what was worked out yesterday was -- I mean, obviously BP is a company that possesses tremendous assets.\xc2\xa0 If I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, I think they have the largest producing oil well in the world -- obviously a number of assets in order to take something like that and make it the largest producing well in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have that collateral as they pay into the fund to ensure and to make sure that nothing risks the amount that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put in there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re giving it over four years.\xc2\xa0 But setting that aside, given the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in BP staying solvent, didn\xe2\x80\x99t the government, the administration, exacerbate BP\xe2\x80\x99s financial position last week by taking such an aggressive view of liability -- Salazar, you at this podium --about the oil rig workers -- a position it now disavows, as Chip says, Carol Browner saying --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- let me just finish the thought -- Carol Browner said there are very significant legal questions about their liability; every lawyer will tell you that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 BP\xe2\x80\x99s stock dove 16 percent on the day that Ken Salazar made those comments.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the government have a role to act responsibly and not exacerbate that situation for BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand -- understand that the amount that, even if you fully compensated rig workers, right, you\xe2\x80\x99re not even close to a billion, let alone $20 billion, right?\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s understand that what might imperil the company financially is not paying for the sidelined rig workers at 33 drilling points in the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 What it -- hold on, let me finish my thought.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for, and what I think has caused -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into commenting about their stock, but I think what has caused -- let me not get into commenting on the stock -- I think that they are responsible for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s greatest environmental disaster and they are going to have to pay to compensate those that were impacted economically, they\xe2\x80\x99ll pay the government the damages for what it\xe2\x80\x99s done to the environment, they\xe2\x80\x99ll pay the cleanup costs, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be fined.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s their price for doing business in a way that caused this damage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the bottom line, just to put a bow on it, does the administration recognize that it has a special responsibility to not take a very aggressive and legally flawed position that could exacerbate an already precarious financial position?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that in any way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, did the President spend any time alone with Mr. Hayward, or was it only with the chairman?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, he spoke for -- the first 20 minutes was with all of the six -- I think it was six -- BP representatives and their outside counsel, and then 25 minutes with the chair.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 A couple things.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The fund doesn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t think Major was going to pass.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fund doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xc2\xa0 The negotiations, according to people I\xe2\x80\x99ve to talked to at Justice today, are going on about the contours of it -- is that your understanding?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fund, the escrow fund.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, understanding the framework agreement that was laid out, the appeals process that has been laid out, the payments in the collateral --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those things have been locked down.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are working through the setup of the independent claims process that will be overseen by Ken Feinberg.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the three-member panel.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the three-member panel that allows a claimant to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a timeline for that, agreed upon with BP, that the American public can evaluate as far as how\xe2\x80\x99s it going and when they should be ready to see this -- and the folks in the Gulf?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve told -- I believe in the negotiations we told them and expect that Mr. Feinberg will set this up as quickly as possible, he obviously -- one of the reasons that he\xe2\x80\x99s selected as somebody who has expertise and experience in this type of work.\xc2\xa0 The claims process that we have now continues as we transition to an independent body, and that anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s involved in the claims process now -- so you filed -- so you filed a claim two days ago, you still have the 90 days to get your claim processed.\xc2\xa0 And if -- as I understand it, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like the outcome of what BP says, you can enter the appeals process in the new system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I heard this commented by folks in the Gulf now, they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of wondering there are these places, there are these numbers, there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that we\xe2\x80\x99ve somewhat grown accustomed to.\xc2\xa0 Will all of those portals, if you will, to this claims process remain, or will they be replaced?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- my guess is that they will remain, Major.\xc2\xa0 What we envision is a fairly seamless process because -- and I forget the number that Admiral Allen read yesterday about the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sixty-six thousand --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the number of claims that are in the process, the number of claims that are being adjudicated.\xc2\xa0 I think we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- and certainly did yesterday in the agreement -- believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get an independent process to evaluate those claims.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, technically, on the agreement, will that be released in written form for the public to view at any point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see why not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing on Svanberg\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Did the President see them?\xc2\xa0 Did he, in his meeting with Svanberg, detect any of the clumsy language that he used in reference to \xe2\x80\x9csmall people\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Did the President think that was an accident on his part?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not talked to the President specifically about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President did not -- I talked to him about the meeting and the President did not mention anything.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To shift gears a little, does the administration have any comments about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow, I guess, construction materials in by land but leave the naval blockade in place?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that we welcome the principles that were announced by the Israeli government today.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re a step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work in the coming days with our Israel friends to continue to improve a humanitarian situation in Gaza that the President has said is unsustainable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the deepwater rigs that are under inspection now, how is that going?\xc2\xa0 Have you -- have they had a chance to look -- will any of those open up again?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the commission that is in the process -- the commission -- that will be part of the commission\xe2\x80\x99s work, to discuss the regulatory framework around their operation.\xc2\xa0 And I will say this, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and as the President said in his speech, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait for a six-month deadline.\xc2\xa0 It can be something that he would encourage that they do quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication that any of the companies are either pulling out, stopping -- taking wells that were due to be built or planned at least for the Gulf and moving them to other countries?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You mean the MODUs -- the mobile drilling units?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that exploration that was going to be American-produced oil now going to other oil-producing countries because of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again -- and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re probably saying the same thing, largely -- because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer if anybody has -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously got -- you remember what the Deepwater Horizon looked like.\xc2\xa0 I do not know if those drilling units, if any of those drilling units have left for other places.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just phrase it this way, then.\xc2\xa0 Does the President fear that the government response to this will drive away what would have been American-produced oil and then now make the country more dependent on foreign oil?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what would make us completely dependent on foreign oil is if this happened again, right?\xc2\xa0 So the President believed that, in weighing all of the economic and environmental concerns, and all the safety concerns, especially given that we did not have and still don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what happened, that continuing drilling on those 33 sites was not what should be done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just one question?\xc2\xa0 Just one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go right in front of you, and then -- don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, Lester, I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question on the stimulus.\xc2\xa0 There have been repeated attempts to try and cut it and use some of that money to pay for other emergency spending, like unemployment benefits, all of which have failed.\xc2\xa0 But in the last few weeks Majority Leader Hoyer and Chairman Obey have both said they\xe2\x80\x99re open to the idea of redirecting stimulus funds to pay for other jobs proposals.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys open to that idea as well?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a plan you heard the Vice President talk about that we believe is helping what was a very fragile economy become more stable; that we need to continue to implement the plan that we have and not take away particularly, for instance, money away from very important projects like education right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I want to quickly clarify the answer to Major.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the framework that was agreed to yesterday, is anything at this point actually signed, and will it ever actually be signed between BP and the administration?\xc2\xa0 Or is it more of just an agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can find out if there\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of paper.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- beyond the fact sheet, let me check and see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And prior to their voluntary agreement yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s been the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that you had the legal authority to compel them to do this if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it on their own.\xc2\xa0 Can you provide us -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be at this exact moment, but what the actual code, the actual statutory --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s within the -- let me see if --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all in the Oil Pollution Act --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not in any other place?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the Oil Pollution Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I want to make sure I get that language.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, again, referring to the Oil Pollution Act, the threshold for the liability cap being lifted in that law, as I understand, is a threshold of gross negligence.\xc2\xa0 You guys have said -- used various terms to describe BP\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in the Gulf; recklessness is one of them.\xc2\xa0 Do you think at this point in time that that gross negligence bar has been reached?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me be careful not to get into the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s investigation, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll come to that determination.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, Glenn, gross negligence is one of the automatic ways that that cap is lifted.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that we should not wait for that investigation as hundreds of thousands have been impacted and are -- continue to be surprised that people object to lifting a 20-year-old number for a disaster in a far different place that we all know is greatly going to exceed that amount of money.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just one quick follow on that.\xc2\xa0 The bill that\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding -- the energy bill that will emerge from the Senate will almost certainly include a liability cap -- the liability cap being lifted.\xc2\xa0 Would you accept that alone without comprehensive energy reform?\xc2\xa0 Would that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is part of comprehensive energy reform.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- lifting the liability cap shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have -- should not be impacted -- should not impact the debate about our energy policy for the future.\xc2\xa0 This should be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it would be a separate piece of legislation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think what Senator Menendez was trying to do was get them to act on that separate piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go anywhere.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other than what Representative Barton said this morning, other Republicans and conservatives have said similar things.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not interested.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I am -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You hung around, Savannah.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michele Bachmann called the fund a redistribution of wealth fund.\xc2\xa0 On FOX they\xe2\x80\x99re calling it \xe2\x80\x9cChavez-like\xe2\x80\x9d as in Venezuela Chavez.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not the boxer?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the boxer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to the larger theme here of Republican and conservative opposition to this as yet another Obama socialistic, big-government initiative?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell what planet these people live on.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to understand -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to understand their viewpoint, but it may explain their votes on financial regulation; it explains how they view whether or not the banks ought to be able to write their own rules and play the game the way they played it in -- several years ago that caused our economy to crash.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s understanding how we got an MMS that was handing out drugs in favor of drilling permits.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of regulatory structure we ought to have, and it certainly sends an awful message to any company around the world, particularly one as large as BP, that they can come here, do what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to our economy, the environment, and as the Vice President so eloquently said, a way of life for so many -- and if you listen to Congressman Barton, Congressman [sic] Bachmann, Congressman Price, you\xe2\x80\x99d think somehow BP was owed a handkerchief and a crying shoulder.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That VP was what?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The VP was so eloquent in talking about how much it threatened a way of life.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a delusional thing.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think the Republican Party is going to have to, on Capitol Hill, look at whether or not somebody that has the viewpoint that Joe Barton has, if he should sit on -- not just sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee, but be the ranking member, as we look into and as that committee looks into actively what happened on the Deepwater Horizon if his opening bid is an \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x9d to BP.\xc2\xa0 Maybe Congressman Barton should drive to the Gulf Coast of Texas or to the Gulf Coast in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and ask the people down there whether his opening bid should have been an apology to BP.</p>\n<p>Sam, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Lester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, what have your impressions been of Tony Hayward\xe2\x80\x99s testimony so far?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been criticized by some on the Hill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The truth is I have not watched -- I watched a very little bit of the opening statements in which I saw Congressman Barton, but I have not seen much of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the second question is, Secretary Clinton was speaking to Ecuadorian television I guess today and she said that the Department of Justice \xe2\x80\x9cwill be bringing a lawsuit against the Arizona immigration act.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have any understanding of where that process stands?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DOJ to discuss how they\xe2\x80\x99re looking into the law.</p>\n<p>Lester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post reports that South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s one-time chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Donald Fowler, thinks that the state\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. Senate Democrat nominee Alvin Greene is a Republican plant, even though he got 100,000 votes.\xc2\xa0 And my question, how does the President react to this and will he support nominee Greene?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the South Carolina party is rightly looking into the circumstances of that nomination.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to tell us what the President is going to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the South Carolina Democratic Party has settled on him as a nominee.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:24 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
