EDT</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Just to go quickly through the rules as we get started here, if everybody is ready to go.\xc2\xa0 We\'re doing this obviously off camera and on the background as senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tI will turn this over to my colleague to walk you through some of the information that has been disclosed overnight.\xc2\xa0 And we will, at the end of this process, take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everybody.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m going to do is focus on the history and background of this issue, in particular the technical elements and why we\'ve made decisions to go ahead and brief the IAEA and reveal the existence of this facility, which we\'ve known about for some time.\xc2\xa0 Then I\'m going to ask my colleague to talk about the diplomatic state of play, focusing in on the upcoming October 1st meeting, which President Obama and Prime Minister Brown and President Sarkozy made very clear is going to be critical in terms of seeing concrete action from Iran to reassure the international community and to correct the violations of Iran\'s international commitments.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tLet me start with a bit of history.\xc2\xa0 Just to remind all of you that the Iranian nuclear issue first became public back in 2002, when it was revealed that Iran was building a secret underground enrichment facility, which we now know as the Natanz facility.\xc2\xa0 Once the Iranians were caught building the secret underground enrichment facility with centrifuge machines in it, they were forced to declare the facility, to allow the IAEA inspectors to inspect the facility and to place it under safeguards.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, Iran has continued to build that facility despite a number of U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding that they completely suspend all activity there.\xc2\xa0 And the state of play in Natanz is well known from the IAEA reports in terms of the Iranians having about 8,000 centrifuge machines there, about half of which are producing low-enriched uranium at a rate of about two kilograms a day.\xc2\xa0 And they have accumulated a stockpile of about 1,400 kilograms of low-enriched uranium.\xc2\xa0 So we know what\'s going on at the Natanz facility because it\'s under IAEA safeguards.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, it was evident to everybody, both the United States and our allies, that if the Iranians wanted to pursue a nuclear weapons option the use of the Natanz facility was a very unattractive approach; because the IAEA inspectors were there, it would be noticed if Iran tried to produce weapons-grade uranium at that facility, or if they expelled the IAEA inspectors, everybody would assume that they were converting the facility to produce weapons-grade uranium.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo the obvious option for Iran would be to build another secret underground enrichment facility, and our intelligence services, working in very close cooperation with our allies, for the past several years have been looking for such a facility.\xc2\xa0 And not surprisingly, we found one.\xc2\xa0 So we have known for some time now that Iran was building a second underground enrichment facility.\xc2\xa0 And as the President mentioned this morning, it\'s located near the city of Qom, a very heavily protected, very heavily disguised facility.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it\'s not yet operational.\xc2\xa0 We think it\'s most likely at least a few months, perhaps more, from having all of the centrifuges installed and being capable of operating if the Iranians made a decision to begin operating it.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tOur information is that the facility is designed to hold about 3,000 centrifuge machines.\xc2\xa0 Now, that\'s not a large enough number to make any sense from a commercial standpoint.\xc2\xa0 It cannot produce a significant quantity of low-enriched uranium.\xc2\xa0 But if you want to use the facility in order to produce a small amount of weapons-grade uranium, enough for a bomb or two a year, it\'s the right size.\xc2\xa0 And our information is that the Iranians began this facility with the intent that it be secret, and therefore giving them an option of producing weapons-grade uranium without the international community knowing about it.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, as I said, we\'ve been aware of this facility for several years; we\'ve been watching the construction, we\'ve been building up a case so that we were sure that we had very strong evidence, irrefutable evidence, that the intent of this facility was as an enrichment plant.\xc2\xa0 We also learned that the Iranians learned that the secrecy of the facility was compromised.\xc2\xa0 So they came to believe that the value of the facility as a secret facility was no longer valid and --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was that?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Excuse me?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was that?\xc2\xa0 When did they learn that?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t be precise.\xc2\xa0 All I can say is that fairly recently -- and recognizing that they might then choose to disclose the facility themselves, we worked with our allies -- the U.K. and the French -- to put together a briefing, an extraordinarily detailed briefing, for the IAEA, because we anticipated that we would need to provide that briefing to the agency so that they would be able to conduct a proper investigation -- not just of the facility itself, but of the support facilities that are producing materials and equipment for this facility, what the Iranian decision-making process and intent was to build this facility.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tIt\'s important to recognize that when the IAEA investigates they don\'t just go to one facility, they try to understand how it fits in with the overall intent of a country\'s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, earlier this week, as President Obama said, we learned that Iran sent a letter to the IAEA which in very vague terms disclosed that Iran was constructing a "pilot-scale enrichment plant" designed to produce 5 percent enriched uranium, and that the Iranians would provide additional information in the future as appropriate.\xc2\xa0 Well, based on that letter, we felt it was important that we proceed quickly to brief the IAEA so that they can conduct an adequate investigation.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said, we carried out that briefing in Vienna yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And the IAEA, I\'m happy to say, is following up very vigorously.\xc2\xa0 You can ask them, of course, but my understanding is that they\'re seeking access to this facility as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 And no doubt they will be reporting to the Board of Governors on the results of their investigations.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, we think, as the President said, this is another example, if we needed one, to remind us that the history of Iran\'s program is very disturbing.\xc2\xa0 The Security Council -- several Security Council resolutions since 2006 has demanded that Iran suspend all enrichment-related activities.\xc2\xa0 This program is obviously a violation of that -- of those Security Council resolutions.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tThe safeguards agreement between Iran and the IAEA requires Iran to declare nuclear facilities as soon as they begin construction.\xc2\xa0 Now, in March of 2007, Iran unilaterally said it did not feel bound by that element of its safeguards agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we know construction of the facility began even before the Iranians unilaterally said that they did not feel bound by that obligation.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo clearly this is inconsistent, in my view; obviously a violation of their safeguards agreement.\xc2\xa0 The IAEA will obviously be investigating that and making a report to the Board of Governors as they pursue their investigation.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tOne last thing I want to say.\xc2\xa0 This was very sensitive intelligence information.\xc2\xa0 But nonetheless, in order to build a coalition with the P5-plus-1, we are taking the extraordinary step of sharing as much of the information as we can with the other countries that are part of this group -- the Russians, the Chinese, and the Germans.\xc2\xa0 And they are studying that information.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll be engaging with them.\xc2\xa0 I think that it will benefit our diplomatic efforts to once again reveal that Iran is carrying out nuclear activities in secret in violation of their international obligations.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAnd I think you\'ve seen that our strategy has already begun to bear fruit.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, in the meeting earlier this week between President Obama and President Medvedev, President Medvedev talked about the possibility of needing to use sanctions if diplomacy failed.\xc2\xa0 President Obama and President Hu also had extensive discussions on the question of how to deal with Iran, and obviously the October 1st meeting of the P5-plus-1 in Iran is going to be a critical test of Iran\'s intention.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Hans, we\'ll get to questions in a second.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, what I\'d like to do, since I\'ve talked about the October 1st, I\'d like to ask my colleague to talk a little bit about that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just going to mention a few things about the diplomatic track.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I\'m sure most of you know, in April of this year, the P5 countries, the permanent members of the Security Council, and Germany, met in London to address the diplomatic track.\xc2\xa0 They reaffirmed the proposal that\'s been on the table for quite a while since June 2008, and they called on Iran to begin engagement, to begin direct negotiations.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tThere was a lot of support for the policies of the new Obama administration for having a tough, direct dialogue with Iran.\xc2\xa0 So this offer was made repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 The Iranians refused to meet, refused to accept this offer.\xc2\xa0 The President has been making clear for quite some time that it\'s important for the international community to take stock of the situation, and he specifically talked about September and the beginning of the U.N. General Assembly when world leaders would be coming together to evaluate Iran\'s seriousness in addressing the concerns of the international community.\xc2\xa0 I think Iran was feeling the pressure that was being put on them, and they agreed to hold a meeting of the P5-plus-1 countries on October 1st in Geneva.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tThis is going to be a critical opportunity for Iran to demonstrate that it\'s willing to address the very serious concerns that have been raised about its intentions in the nuclear area.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tI think all P5-plus-1 countries are united.\xc2\xa0 Two days ago in New York, foreign ministers of those countries issued a strong statement.\xc2\xa0 They demonstrated that they are unified.\xc2\xa0 They reaffirmed what we call a dual-track policy, engagement on the one hand but pressure and sanctions if Iran does not negotiate seriously.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo October 1st will be a serious test of Iran\'s willingness to address these concerns, and as a result of the initiative taken today to reveal this previously undisclosed site, this matter will be on the agenda of October 1st.\xc2\xa0 Iran will be pressed to cooperate with the IAEA\'s investigation of this very disturbing situation.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tWe hope that there will be tangible progress.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s up to Iran.\xc2\xa0 It\'s up to Iran to respond in a concrete way to the offers that are on the table and to address the concerns of the world community.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tThat\'s all I\'ll say for now.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll start with a few questions.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got plenty of time, so we\'ll work around here.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tJake.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question for each of the gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Sir, yesterday a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing spoke against the idea of sanctions for Iran.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could talk about that.\xc2\xa0 And sir, if -- how many secret nuclear facilities do you think Iran has?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you repeat the question?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Jake\'s question was to respond to a statement from Chinese Foreign Ministry yesterday about their reticence on sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And secondly, a question that he\'s not going to answer, which -- how many secret nuclear facilities does Iran have and to list them in alphabetical order.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\'s more than this one?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been consulting with the Chinese in the last 24 and 48 hours.\xc2\xa0 As you heard, the intelligence on this was developed by the U.S., the U.K., and France.\xc2\xa0 And China is just now fully absorbing these latest revelations.\xc2\xa0 I think we should stay tuned for the Chinese position in the coming days now that they -- now that they are aware of this new information.\xc2\xa0 The statement they made was before our most recent discussions.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Obviously I\'m not in a position to answer that, but I would just say this, that given Iran\'s history of pursuing secret nuclear activities and given the logic of them trying to develop secret facilities as the safest way for them to build nuclear weapons if they make that political decision.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously going to be very vigilant in continuing our efforts to try to detect such facilities if they exist.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let me just add to that.\xc2\xa0 I think, obviously, our understanding and knowledge of the existence of this facility for quite some time is a great testament to our intelligence community and the work that they have done and are continuing to do to give us the very best intelligence in the world.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tChuck.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was this intelligence shared with the Russians?\xc2\xa0 Was it this week, ahead of the President\'s comments in New York?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The question was, when was this intelligence shared with the Russians?\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to bring up for that one another senior administration official who deals with -- NSC -- with this question.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I see you\'ve got the full team here.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\'re here to serve, Chuck.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I didn\'t hear the question.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was this information shared with the Russian delegation?\xc2\xa0 For example, did they know it before President Medvedev made the most recent comments he made in New York this week?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right around that time, and we\'ve been in deliberations with them all the way through, including last night, in capitals.\xc2\xa0 It was shared --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before or after the bilat?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 At or around the time of the bilat.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it shared at the meeting between the Presidents?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We had a chance to have our President speak directly about this issue in the bilat.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tYes.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And somebody else, if possible.\xc2\xa0 Can you do the sanctions without Russian support?\xc2\xa0 Can you impose new sanctions without Russia\'s support?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the whole purpose of having -- can you impose sanctions without Russian support -- I would just say this.\xc2\xa0 The whole purpose of building up, talking with the Russians, discussing this issue over numerous times, I remind you, is the subject -- the main subject of the July summit.\xc2\xa0 It was the main subject of the bilateral meeting we had in New York -- we have been speaking with the Russians since then to this very point -- is to have a very coordinated policy in terms of a P5-plus-1 outcome.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAbout that, that\'s a different question, but that\'s the objective with the Russians.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to get my colleague to add something to this.\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 The information was shared during the bilateral meeting.\xc2\xa0 We, as my colleague said, worked last night and continue to work with the Russians as they look through intelligence and get a better understanding of what we know.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tDo you want to add to the -- oh, you\'re good?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m good.\xc2\xa0 And if I may, what is your idea?\xc2\xa0 Can the sanctions be imposed without support from Russia and China?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think, at this point, what you\'ve heard everyone say -- I know what you\'ve heard the President and the two leaders say this morning, we are focused on -- we are focused on meetings that will happen next week on October the 1st.\xc2\xa0 We believe there are substantial responsibilities that the Iranians, certainly in light of this information, must meet.\xc2\xa0 They have a path and an opportunity to do -- to finally do what\'s right.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard, though, the President say very clearly, not addressing this, not owning up to it, and not taking substantial action to stop it will -- people will be held accountable.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tJonathan.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of technical questions.\xc2\xa0 First, if the facility is not complete and they have not received enriched -- or I mean uranium to enrich -- can you say in what way that the Iranians might be closer to a nuclear weapon?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAnd secondly, I thought under the NPT the Iranians weren\'t obligated to report it to the IAEA until they were bringing fuel in.\xc2\xa0 So could you tell me if there was some kind of change to the arrangement there?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Did everyone hear -- want us to still repeat the questions?\xc2\xa0 You want to go ahead?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 As to your first question, I think the revelation of this facility and the fact that Iran will be forced, I believe, at the end of the day, because of international pressure, to allow the IAEA to inspect this facility and place it under safeguards, it sets their nuclear weapons program back.\xc2\xa0 So this is a victory, in terms of making it more difficult for them to develop a nuclear weapons capacity, just as the discovery of Natanz and the fact that they were forced to put that under inspection set the program back.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, as to your second question, as I mentioned earlier, in a modern safeguards agreement, which the IAEA has with all countries that have a comprehensive safeguards agreement, countries are obligated to report to the agency as soon as they make a decision, as soon as they begin construction of a nuclear facility.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of that is to make sure that the safeguards are designed to fit with the technical characteristics of the facility.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, in March, as I said, in March of 2007, Iran unilaterally announced that it no longer considered itself obligated by that provision of its safeguards agreement, which obviously is -- sets off some alarm bells if you suspect that they may be trying to conceal nuclear activities.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a technical violation of IAEA rules?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think it is.\xc2\xa0 I think it clearly is.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the IAEA will be investigating this, and we would expect them to report on that to the Board of Governors.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Oh, hold on.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add this -- after the -- in March 2007, after the Iranians pulled back and said they\'re no longer bound by this, the IAEA issued a legal ruling saying countries are not able legally unilaterally to pull back from this.\xc2\xa0 There has to be an agreement with the IAEA to change the rules of the game.\xc2\xa0 So according to the IAEA, Iran is still bound to notify the agency at the time a decision is made to construct a new facility.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, no matter what interpretation you put on this, Iran began construction of that facility at a time when they were legally bound to declare it.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Walk us a little bit through the IAEA investigative process.\xc2\xa0 So obviously you guys are calling on them to comply immediately.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got the talks on October 1st.\xc2\xa0 When do they go in?\xc2\xa0 I mean, and will they go in without Iranian permission?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess, and how quickly will this investigative process take the IAEA?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll walk you through the IAEA investigative process.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, the IAEA has been very vigorous in the last couple of years since the 2002 revelation in rooting out the history of Iran\'s nuclear program and keeping it under safeguards.\xc2\xa0 I would expect them, based on that track record, to very vigorously follow the information that\'s available to them and all the leads they have.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tNow, how quickly they get into the facility, that\'s a decision for Iran to make.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we, the entire P5-plus-1, are going to be pressing for access as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 Certainly we hope that takes --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it at the top of the agenda October 1st?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, this -- I think this is clearly going to be a very significant item on the agenda, and I think, in our view, as the President said, Iran needs to take concrete action to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful, because the evidence we have available certainly doesn\'t suggest that.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that end up delaying the sanction threat?\xc2\xa0 The French President today said December.\xc2\xa0 Does that delay -- if they say, okay, fine, IAEA can come inspect what we\'re doing -- does that delay the sanction threat?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does this say -- could they slow-walk this process by using the IAEA?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The question is whether the insertion of IAEA inspectors somehow slows down the imposition of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I\'d just say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 My colleague, my senior administration official colleague here reports that the IAEA has already approached the Iranians based on this information.\xc2\xa0 That is indicative, I think, of indisputable fact that there is, at the moment, an amount of international consensus and cooperation, not to mention impatience, with Iran\'s suspect nuclear facility, or nuclear program, as President Medvedev said with the President on Wednesday, that this international consensus is a source of great leverage on the Iranians.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAnd the point here, Chuck, I think is not to look at what will happen with the sanctions.\xc2\xa0 The question is, what will the Iranians do now that the international community, as united as it is in confronting Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran, with the information that we have confronted them with, what steps specifically will they take to allay this international consensus, cooperation, and sense of impatience.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you reach out to --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- hold on one sec -- hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- before I take another question, I want to read very specifically -- to reiterate what has just been said, what the IAEA said about this today:</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\t"In response, the IAEA has requested Iran to provide specific information and access to the facility as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 This will allow the agency to assess safeguards, verification requirements for the facility."\xc2\xa0 That, I believe, can be found on their Web site.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tApril.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everyone has talked about diplomacy, talking about October 1, and then you had Sarkozy talking about punishment in December.\xc2\xa0 Is the President -- is the President on the same wavelength as Sarkozy?\xc2\xa0 I guess because you\'ve gone down this road, other administrations have gone down this road so many times before, is he -- is everyone looking at, beyond the present, or is the President in line with this -- at punishment, at more sanctions?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 As one of my colleagues suggested over the summer, senior administration policymakers asked that our intelligence community work together with our French and U.K. counterparts to develop a consensus intelligence presentation to the IAEA about the information that we all have related to this covert facility.\xc2\xa0 That is indicative of the deep cooperation and consensus among these three, as well as, as we\'ve seen demonstrated just on Wednesday evening, with the P5-plus-1 foreign ministers\' statement about what we expect from Iran -- all indications of the deep consensus and growing impatience among the international community about Iran\'s suspect nuclear program.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tThe fact of the matter is that it will be Iran now that determines what happens as it relates to that international consensus.\xc2\xa0 If they take the opportunity at the October 1 meeting to allay the concerns of the international community about the wholly peaceful intentions of its nuclear program, that\'s one thing.\xc2\xa0 If they choose not to, that\'s quite another.\xc2\xa0 But we ought not get ahead of ourselves on exactly what steps will be taken thereafter, because at the moment it\'s less about the international community, which, as I\'ve suggested, is more united and operating in a more consensual fashion that ever on this issue, but rather it will be based on what the Iranians choose.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Realistically, what are you expecting from China after all of this IAEA --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think as my colleague just said, we\'re in the process of -- we have obviously begun to brief all of the members of the P5-plus-1, and they\'re in the process of looking through and digesting the information that the world now knows.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some sequencing of those briefings?\xc2\xa0 Russia was briefed before China?\xc2\xa0 Or the intelligence was shared with Russia before China?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the intelligence was shared principally at the same time.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was before you guys briefed the IAEA yesterday?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, it was not.\xc2\xa0 It was after.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I thought that the meeting with Medvedev was Wednesday.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t confuse -- don\'t confuse the notion that, in a bilateral meeting with Medvedev, this was brought up.\xc2\xa0 But the formal sharing of a much more technical assessment, as was done by the three intelligence agencies yesterday afternoon in Vienna, that\'s now happened post-bilat.\xc2\xa0 That would not be done in the course of a bilateral with --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That briefing was not given to the Russians on Wednesday?\xc2\xa0 It was given --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you speak with the -- did you speak with the Israelis?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 Just everyone calm down.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to get --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Can we just walk through this?\xc2\xa0 Wednesday night, political leadership in New York was given a heads-up.\xc2\xa0 Thursday, the joint intelligence presentation was made to the IAEA by the three intelligence services.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday morning or Thursday afternoon?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thursday afternoon, Vienna time.\xc2\xa0 Today we are sharing, at a technical level, the intelligence about the facility.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going through this very methodically.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President in the bilateral also gave President Medvedev a heads-up about what we knew.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Michael.\xc2\xa0 Hold on, Jonathan.\xc2\xa0 Michael.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you help me understand the timing of this?\xc2\xa0 These facilities, obviously, are harder to get rid of once they\'re built.\xc2\xa0 So if you all knew about this -- not you guys, in this case -- but several years ago, was there some reason why it didn\'t make sense to alert the world to the impending construction of the thing back then, and not have to then contend with a nearly completed one?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think it would be a terrible mistake if we prematurely disclosed the facility, because at a very early stage of construction, a facility like this could have multiple uses.\xc2\xa0 So we thought it was very important to wait until the facility had reached the stage of construction where it was undeniably intended for use as a centrifuge facility.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo, from our standpoint -- and of course it takes years to build these facilities -- and also we were building the case so that we felt that we were in a very strong position when the time came -- because we knew eventually this time would come -- we would want to brief the IAEA as well as the other countries we\'re working with.\xc2\xa0 So that explains the delay.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there ever a concern about intelligence?\xc2\xa0 Was there ever a concern about faulty intelligence?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 April, April, let\'s do this one at a time.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve had a crack.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s get around the room.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to Israel about this, and are they on board, and are they part of --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me just go back to your point, your first question, and then we can answer the next one.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tThe President was first briefed on this during the transition.\xc2\xa0 He was very insistent, as he has been on this issue since day one, that this is an issue that needed to be addressed urgently.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, as my colleagues have made clear, we\'ve been aware of this facility now for several years.\xc2\xa0 The President became aware of it as President-elect and we have been working quite aggressively with our friends to make sure we have a very solid case to present to the IAEA, having learned that such intelligence presentations have to be made in a very credible fashion because of the nature of the charges.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAs it relates to your question about Israel, they are aware of the facility and the announcement that we\'re making today.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s our understanding that they\'re -- I think you answered whether they were on board.\xc2\xa0 There\'s not a particular thing for them to be on board with, but I think it is fair to represent that they see that this path is obviously advancing our interest in delaying the Iranian nuclear program.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that the construction of this facility was started before Ahmadinejad?\xc2\xa0 And last year, there was an intelligence report that calls -- or assessment -- because it cast doubt about the fact that Iran was actually pursuing nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 Is this your understanding now that Iran is definitely after nuclear weapons, or is it the intelligence assessment?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think both of those questions, while good, are not something that, based on intelligence, we feel comfortable getting into here.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tJon.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 When President Obama met with President Hu on Wednesday prior to his meeting I think with Medvedev, was Hu given the same heads-up that Medvedev was given?\xc2\xa0 And secondly -- so, first, was Hu given the same heads-up as Medvedev?\xc2\xa0 Secondly -- secondly, did any of our other allies -- did we share this information with anybody prior to this week?\xc2\xa0 Did anybody know of it?\xc2\xa0 Did the U.K. and France know about it?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as we mentioned, from the very beginning the U.S. has been working closely with both the U.K. and France in terms of both sharing the information that we had available among ourselves and in doing the analysis.\xc2\xa0 And furthermore, making sure that this intelligence cooperation was closely lashed up with our diplomatic strategy.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s been, I think, really extraordinarily close cooperation, which is pretty unusual when you\'re dealing with this kind of sensitive information among those three allies, not only in terms of intelligence work together but also making sure how the intelligence supports and reinforces our diplomatic efforts.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you say how far back the intelligence-sharing between the U.K. and France and the U.S. --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we don\'t want to get into -- too specifically into the intel.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about President Hu?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The Iran issue was extensively discussed in President Obama\'s meeting with President Hu.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, I would say it was the centerpiece to the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But this particular facility was not discussed.\xc2\xa0 The bilat was before the one with Medvedev.\xc2\xa0 So it was not discussed then.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why was that a reason for not discussing it?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why was that a reason for not discussing it, the fact that it was prior to Medvedev?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 There were discussions that were going on at different levels with us and the Chinese on that.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tYes, sir.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, do you expect the G20 to support this, you know, at some -- to express some kind of declaration of support?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we are here with all these countries that could strengthen -- you know, big international declaration?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect a statement later?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have one of these guys address that.\xc2\xa0 I know that throughout yesterday evening, and I know today, we have had at, again, various levels discussions with member states that are here, sharing with them also information that we\'ve learned.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tI don\'t -- do you have anything on a statement?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have anything on that now.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have anything right now.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMajor.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the public presentation this morning, President Medvedev was not there.\xc2\xa0 Was there an effort to invite him?\xc2\xa0 Should the public read anything into his absence, either that he\'s ambiguous about the importance of this information or his willingness to pursue sanctions?\xc2\xa0 And secondarily, the President sounded less aggressive than either Prime Minister Brown or French President Sarkozy.\xc2\xa0 Was there any particular reason for holding his rhetoric back as compared to those two?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me take a crack at the second one, and my colleague will do as well.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you repeat the question?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 The second question was, Major said he detected some softer language on the part of the President than with the two others.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say, I think if you read clearly the statement of the President, if you read clearly the statements that President Obama has made within several feet of Mr. Medvedev just the other day, I think it\'s pretty clear that the President has stated what has to happen, that Iran, as my colleague said earlier, has a choice that they need to make in the next week, and that failure to live up to their international obligations will hold them accountable for that.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAnd I think if you look back at the statements that the President has made even dating back to a pool spray we did in the Oval Office where he talked about that this was an issue that would be addressed by the end of the year, I think it\'s pretty clear not just the three up there but many others are on the same page.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let my colleague take a --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The degrees of Sarkozy and Brown and what they said?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think all three of them, as well as others, are on the same page as many in the international community continue to be in collectively addressing this threat.\xc2\xa0 The first question to my colleague.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Major, the briefers today -- or the presenters today were the heads of government or heads of state of the three intelligence services that briefed the IAEA yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So the bottom line is, those are the possessors of the particular set of information and intelligence that was shared yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So as a result, we thought that made the most sense to have them represented on the stage, not anything other than -- not anything other than that.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAnd certainly as it relates to my colleague\'s point, I\'d just go back to a response to a question here.\xc2\xa0 I think, as you\'ve seen during the course of this week, there is a degree of consensus and cooperation and a depth of growing impatience shared among the international community; the P5-plus-1; the IAEA, as demonstrated in the statement my colleague read; and many others as it relates to Iran\'s suspect nuclear program.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\'d be willing to answer, could you tell us which of the three allies -- the U.S., the U.K., or France -- first discovered this intelligence?\xc2\xa0 And can you be any more specific on the year?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into -- I\'m not going to get into depth on intelligence matters.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when the President and President Medvedev spoke, did the Russian President seem surprised, or did the Russians also know this independently?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made it a practice not to characterize what others have said, and I think I would extend that to their emotions.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in relation to all the countries that have been briefed, or was anyone else aware of this?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'d rather just not get into that.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tDavid.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll come to you next, I\'m sorry.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The senior administration official made the point that you\'ve known about this for a number of years, you did not want to reveal it too early because the nature of the facility was still, which you could imagine when they\'re excavating it.\xc2\xa0 What and when did that assessment change?\xc2\xa0 By the time you came into office, or was it later on this year, well into this year, that you came to the determination that in fact it was a centrifuge facility?\xc2\xa0 And what is the -- what made you come to the judgment in the end that it was?\xc2\xa0 Was it the actual installation of centrifuges?\xc2\xa0 Was it the piping or something else?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think as I indicated, from the very beginning, we had information indicating that the intent of this facility was as a covert centrifuge facility.\xc2\xa0 The point I was making is that we wanted to wait until the actual construction caught up with that intent.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to be too precise about when we think we reached that point, and these kinds of things are always a matter of degree.\xc2\xa0 The further the construction proceeded, the stronger the case.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that certainly within the last few months, we think we\'ve had a very strong basis on which to make our argument, and that was part of the reason why we began this process of preparing a detailed briefing that could be shared with the IAEA and with other countries.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you believe if and when the IAEA gets inside, will they find actual centrifuges installed, or do you think they will simply --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s -- we\'ll have to wait for the IAEA to get inside there and to report back.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on your assessment right now.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Based on my assessment, I think that it will be, as I say, I think we have extremely good evidence -- we shared with the IAEA -- that this is a centrifuge facility.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just stepping back a bit, how far do you think Iran is away from developing a bomb, and how much -- can you elaborate on how much this disrupts that process?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that we\'d get into a firm answer on the first one.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve heard my colleague and others say that the discovery of -- the international discovery of -- by all -- of a clandestine facility sets the program back because it\'s a facility that now is no longer secret.\xc2\xa0 And as we said, the IAEA has requested immediate access to the facility.\xc2\xa0 So I think this is a demonstration, again, of the good work of our intelligence services, the collective work of three countries and a big victory, as my colleague said, for setting this program and their timeline backwards.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some sense of a timeline is important, isn\'t it, because when people say why don\'t -- why aren\'t there sanctions now, why isn\'t there military action now -- you know, a sense of how much time there is to play with.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to get into some of those hypotheticals, except to say, as many have said up here, we are pointing toward some very important discussions and meetings that will take place in one week.\xc2\xa0 And the Iranians have decisions and obligations that they need to make and that they need to live up to, and in many ways, the ball is in their court.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tRichard.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Had this not been found out by the Iranians that our intelligence had determined this, would we have gone through this week -- would we have gone through the U.N., the G20, and would you go through the October 1st meeting still holding this secret?\xc2\xa0 Or was it always the intent to bring this up at least with the Iranians on October 1st?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It\'s kind of hard to go back and reinvent what may -- it\'s kind of like a, I don\'t know, a reverse hypothetical or something.\xc2\xa0 What we are going to continue to do is what we\'ve done now.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a fact-based operation.\xc2\xa0 We\'re collecting very good intelligence on a program about which we have deep concern and about which the international community is united in sharing that concern.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to do that and make decisions based on precisely that kind of fact-based information.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo I think it\'s impossible to turn back the clock and say what might have been otherwise, but what I do know is that we are driven by principle here, which is we are going to make these decisions based on facts, we\'re going to address this urgently, because it is an issue that requires both those principles.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Josh.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that question, do you know what prompted -- or suspect what prompted Iran to make this disclosure to the IAEA on Monday?\xc2\xa0 And was there something that either our intelligence services or the other two intelligence services did in the declassification or verification process that would have alerted the Iranians that we now knew about the facility?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, of course I can\'t speculate about Iranian decision-making and motivation, but I said in my opening statement that we believe that the Iranians learned that the secrecy of the facility had been compromised, and therefore we anticipated that they might very well make a decision to disclose the facility in order to protect themselves, in order to try to defend themselves against the accusation that they were proceeding with a secret program.\xc2\xa0 I think the evidence on the floor makes it very clear that they were proceeding with a secret program.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You learned this before Monday?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the question about sanctions, are there not already sanctions in place against Iran?\xc2\xa0 Could you just recap for us what those sanctions are that are already in place, and what sort of further sanctions are envisioned, and why would they be effective when the sanctions to date have not deterred the Iranians from pursuing its program?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 There are a wide range of penalties and sanctions already imposed.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the five Security Council resolutions, which imposed a range of penalties on -- that have to do with inhibiting Iran\'s nuclear and missile programs and the requirement to have extreme vigilance in dealing with Iranian entities that might be associated with their nuclear and missile programs.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tBut in addition to these multilateral measures, these Security Council-mandated measures, there are a wide range of pressures that are being applied by the United States and by like-minded countries around the world, including our partners around the world, including our partners in Europe.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tAnd so when it comes to sanctions, it\'s not just a matter of getting a Security Council consensus.\xc2\xa0 There are other options as well, and my guess is that the Iranians are feeling the pressure from these national measures, as well as from the collective measures.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sam.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just give a sense to the extent if any congressional leadership was looped in on this?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The question was the degree to which congressional leaders have been looped in on it.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We have briefed the leadership of -- the elected leadership of both chambers, as well as the leaders of -- bipartisan leaders of key committees consistent with our obligations under existing practice to keep Congress currently and fully informed.\xc2\xa0 We also note that we believe Congress is an important partner in this effort as it relates to moving forward on Iran, and it\'s obvious to us that Congress, like the rest of the international community and the partners that we\'ve talked about today, shares the impatience with Iran and shares the consensus about -- the consensus and shared concern about the suspect nuclear program.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was Congress briefed?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wednesday night.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Congress has been briefed over the course of the last, I\'d say, 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 There has now been -- and they will continue to be briefed over the course of the next -- over the course of today.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo we obviously think that it\'s very important that we keep all of our partners at home informed and consulted, and we also are making sure that we\'re coordinating closely with our allies, not only in the P5-plus-1 but we\'ve asked our ambassadors in key countries in the region as well as in Europe and in Asia to make sure that their colleagues in their capitals are aware of the decisions that we\'re taking over the course of these days.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Just going to take a couple more questions, because I know everybody is busy.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMark.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I couldn\'t hear all the questions, but does the U.S. know how the -- how Iran came to find out that the U.S., the U.K., and France were aware of their secret program?\xc2\xa0 Was there a leak somewhere?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\'re just not going to get into the intel on that.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, by Iran going to the IAEA on Monday, did that beat you to the punch in briefing IAEA yesterday?\xc2\xa0 Does it take them off the hook in any way?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let my colleague take a crack at this as well.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you\'ve heard them say very explicitly, both my colleagues have said the requirements that they must uphold when a decision is made about the beginning of construction, which is important.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s pretty clear from the IAEA statements today that the very cursory amount of information that was contained in the letter was hardly a satisfactory level of disclosure.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tWe felt it, at that point, important to, as my colleague said, we have been working together, the three countries, to put together a presentation on this since the summer.\xc2\xa0 The team felt it extremely important to get quickly to Vienna to give a broader, more technical readout on the facility that clearly the Iranians neither had nor were willing to do.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the three nations know in advance of yesterday\'s briefing that Iran had notified IAEA?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mentioned in my opening statement that we became aware, we were told by the IAEA that Iran had provided them with this letter.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tI mean, I think that it\'s very clear that the Iranian letter to the IAEA is too little too late, given the history of the construction of this facility, given the obligations they have, both to the IAEA and to the U.N. Security Council.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tI think the Iranians will no doubt try to defend themselves, but I think they are going to find a very tough audience.\xc2\xa0 And I think as more information comes out about this facility, as the IAEA investigates and reports, I think it\'s going to become even more difficult for the Iranians to mount a plausible defense.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Just one point to make clear.\xc2\xa0 A key motivation of our briefing of the IAEA was to facilitate their investigation.\xc2\xa0 The letter that Iran sent to the IAEA was very sparse, almost no detail and no promise of a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 They talked about providing additional information at an appropriate and due time, whatever that means.\xc2\xa0 So our briefing was really designed to facilitate the work of the IAEA.<br/>\n\t\t\xe2\x80\x83<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a clear idea of when the construction started?\xc2\xa0 And second, President Sarkozy spoke about a December deadline.\xc2\xa0 Does this timeline fit the expectations of the administration?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\'re going to get into the answer on the first question.\xc2\xa0 On the second question, I\'d reiterate what I said to Major, which was two things.\xc2\xa0 One, these three countries have been working together for quite some time on this particular -- the intelligence around this particular facility.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the leaders are together on this.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard, as I reiterated, the President was quite clear in the Oval Office several months ago that the issue of Iran and its program were going to be dealt with this year, and I think that was very explicit.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tYes.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even before this revelation wasn\'t there supposed to be a deadline this week?\xc2\xa0 And when we hear Sarkozy talk about December, how concerned are you that Iran will be taking these deadlines seriously anymore?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think that what we\'ve made clear coming out of the G8 meeting in L\'Aquila was that there would be a stock-taking this week.\xc2\xa0 I think there was that.\xc2\xa0 I think that there was a very clear and firm statement from the P5-plus-1 foreign ministers on Wednesday evening.\xc2\xa0 I think that there was great consensus among the P5-plus-1 at the presidential level as manifested a number of different ways, including the bilateral meeting among President Medvedev and President Obama.\xc2\xa0 And so I think that -- and incidentally, I think that it was not noticed -- it did not go unnoticed that President Ahmadinejad missed an opportunity to elucidate their intentions in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo I think this stock-taking effort continues.\xc2\xa0 But I hasten to direct your attention to the fact that what will happen from here on out is dependent on the choices that the Iranians make.\xc2\xa0 As my senior administration official colleague indicated, the discovery of this clandestine facility sets back the Iranian program and increases our leverage diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 And we intend to make use of it.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you sort of square the revelation of this facility with the special National Intelligence Estimate that recently said that Iran was still many years away from a nuclear weapon?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\'t think we\'ll add anything more to the record here than what we\'ve said already.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hope I didn\'t miss this from somebody else, but have you been asked about this quote that Reuters is reporting from a senior Iranian official?\xc2\xa0 Has anybody asked that?\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard all the questions.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 A senior Iranian official tells Reuters that if it was a covert plant, we would not have informed the International Atomic Energy Agency.\xc2\xa0 And basically they\'re saying that that letter indicates -- I guess they\'re saying that the letter indicates that it wasn\'t secret.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think that, as my colleagues have pointed out, I mean, this is a facility that\'s been under construction for years, that very cursory admission to the IAEA years after the commencement of construction of such a facility whose use is undeniable does not constitute living up to its obligations.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 As we said before, this was inconsistent with an obligation that Iran has had to disclose the facility, to inform the IAEA at the time the decision is made to begin construction.\xc2\xa0 Now, they claim that they have withdrawn from that requirement.\xc2\xa0 The IAEA says they can\'t withdraw from that requirement.\xc2\xa0 But in any event, this construction began before they attempted to withdraw.\xc2\xa0 So no matter how you look at it, this is inconsistent with their safeguards requirements.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 April, we\'ll take one more, and then we\'re going to --</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understanding that this facility was being built many years ago, was there a concern when you did find out, when -- administrations past and national security officials and whomever else found out early on that this was being built, was there ever a concern about faulty intelligence and that\'s why you kept looking into this?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just simply reiterate what my colleagues said before, which is we have worked -- the intelligence services of all three countries have worked together to put together an airtight case of intelligence that could be presented to the IAEA so that there would be no doubt as to exactly what this facility was and the intent of its use.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tObviously we wanted to ensure that that was done and that there would be no questions from that.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back, you know, people have said that our intelligence was faulty in Iraq, and then they said with Iran it\'s been much worse.\xc2\xa0 So was there ever -- I mean, was there a concern about faulty intelligence on this?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think because of the diligence and the work that\'s been done, there is tremendous confidence in what was presented just yesterday in Vienna.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tThanks, guys.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tEND<br/>\n\t\t10:29 A.M.
