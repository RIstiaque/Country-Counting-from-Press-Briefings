b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>\n\tSee below for an answer to a question (marked with an asterisk) posed in the gaggle that required follow up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t* We are confident that Congress will act so that taxes for middle-class families will not go up at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Questions about the income tax withholding schedule should be directed to the Treasury Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t11:13 A.M. EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On START, now that we have Senator Kyl\xe2\x80\x99s announcement yesterday, is the administration still going to try to get START through in a lame duck?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what\xe2\x80\x99s the pathway for passage at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, the President and the administration will push forward on having the Senate ratify the START treaty before the end of the year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s statement on this was clear on why, and that is several things.\xc2\xa0 We will not see what\xe2\x80\x99s encompassed in the treaty, which is the reduction of deployed weapons -- we don\'t have an inspection regime currently to understand what is going on with their stockpile, and not seeing the reduction and not having that inspection regime endangers our national security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese are agreements that have and should -- have in the past and should now pass with strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 It came out of the Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to push this and believes the Senate should act on it before they go home.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s the next step now that Kyl says that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look as if it\xe2\x80\x99s even going to come up in lame duck?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the treaty will come up and I think the treaty will be voted on and I think we\'ll have enough votes to pass it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the offer to Kyl, the $4 billion, is that still on the table?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President shares Senator Kyl\xe2\x80\x99s concern about modernizing our nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And again, as the Vice President said in the statement, we\'ve made a pledge to go seek not just long-term modernization money but to accelerate that at the beginning, in the early part of the window -- and I don\'t have the figures, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s $4.1 billion.\xc2\xa0 We share the concerns on modernizing the program.\xc2\xa0 The team, the Vice President and others, have met with senators including Senator Kyl on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 This not only should get done -- can get done, but it should get done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any more money on the table than the $4.1 billion?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those are the figures that I saw yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you have the votes without Kyl and his people to pass this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We think we do, or we think we\'ll get them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t, Mark, have a whip count in front of me.\xc2\xa0 But these are -- look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think this is going to be a test of the degree to which both sides can work together on things that are of common interest to the American people.\xc2\xa0 I doubt that I have\xc2\xa0 -- I doubt that we have gone into the legislative arena with something that is supported by Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Dick Lugar, Stephen Hadley -- I mean, you could spend the better part of the rest of the morning discussing the people that have\xc2\xa0 -- may have disagreements with us on other policies that think this is the right thing for our national security.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s also, I might add, the right thing for our relationship in the world and particularly with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We have the strongest Iran sanctions regime in place that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had as a country because of the help of the Russians.\xc2\xa0 The Russians have taken a missile transaction to the Iranians off the table -- the S300s.\xc2\xa0 We have a transit route that allows us to get our supplies into Afghanistan because of their help.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a real relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President consider meeting with Senator Kyl?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to meet with anybody.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- this is something that is very important not just to this President, not just this administration, but important to us as country.\xc2\xa0 And if adding another meeting to what the team has done makes that possible, I\'m sure we would certainly not rule it out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just real quick on your point about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he asked for one?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Senator Kyl?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the meetings are on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, I think there was -- I think there have been discussions with him and others in the administration, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said this is going to be a test on whether both sides can work together.\xc2\xa0 There seemed to be another test last night that failed, which is that the President right after the election said, I\'m going to invite the Republicans over for a summer, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have dinner; it was going to be all cordial.\xc2\xa0 And Republicans are basically saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re too busy.\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they -- do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re showing disrespect to the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, and I -- look, I think there are going to be more than one meeting over the next several months and several years on this.\xc2\xa0 They came to us and said they have some organizational issues that they have to work through prior to that meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you buying that?\xc2\xa0 I mean -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like they\xe2\x80\x99re taking class photos and orientation -- that\xe2\x80\x99s more important than meeting with the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'ll let them explain their organizational issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be taking issue with it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a justified excuse to not meet with the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, there\xe2\x80\x99s another meeting date that\xe2\x80\x99s on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re flexible.\xc2\xa0 We are ready to sit down with them tomorrow; we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to sit down with them on the 30th.\xc2\xa0 I presume, as I said a minute ago, we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with them as well going forward.\xc2\xa0 They asked that we change the date so that they can get their respective caucuses more organized.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll move the date --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you with the President when he found out that it was being postponed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, not that I -- no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how he responded when he found out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re happy -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s more convenient for them to wait, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait a little bit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did they ask?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I spent 10 days, as some of you guys did, way overseas, so I do not know all the back-and-forth on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, it likely happened during that 10-day period?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the whole back-and-forth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they make it clear on the day the President announced the meeting, as Mr. Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office said, that he had a scheduling conflict then?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the point of the meeting, is it just for the lame duck?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this would put the November 30th meeting almost halfway through the lame duck period.\xc2\xa0 Is it more to look at farther --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s both.\xc2\xa0 Honestly, it\xe2\x80\x99s both.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously -- I mean, look, the lame duck period is going on right now.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that is heavily tilted toward organizational issues and leadership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me finish the answer to this.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- again, this is not the first time, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the last time that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of the roles that each plays in the lame duck and the transition of those roles that are played in the regular Congress, the group of players is the same.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you disappointed that lame duck is getting off to a kind of slow start?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- they basically -- they\xe2\x80\x99re finishing this week and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be gone next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, next week is Thanksgiving so I\xe2\x80\x99m not disappointed that next week is Thanksgiving, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I will say, Ann, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- in all honesty, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody either here or on Capitol Hill believed that you were going to get a ton of stuff done that first week.\xc2\xa0 Look, traditionally, whether you have a lame duck session or not, you have orientation, you\xe2\x80\x99re having a lot of movement, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody believed that a lump of stuff is going to get done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBecause I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt we have, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, there are a host of issues that have to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 We are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to the end of the year, which means we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to the point in which the tax debate is something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to get worked out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, so it does not speak, this postponement, to poor prospects for cooperation moving forward between the White House and Republicans?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t see it that way.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this will be the first meeting that we have.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be -- or it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last meeting that we have in this situation.\xc2\xa0 And we are -- if they have organizational issues they need to work through, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I think the test of this is not when the meeting is held. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the test ultimately is going to be whether or not you have two sides that are capable of working together to make progress.\xc2\xa0 That was the test -- that was the message of this election, is Washington can\xe2\x80\x99t just be what Washington has always been.\xc2\xa0 It has to -- we have to have people that are capable of sitting down together in a room and moving issues forward.\xc2\xa0 Again, the tax issue is one of those.\xc2\xa0 The START issue is certainly one of those.\xc2\xa0 There are other issues that are ultimately on the docket.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think of it less as -- I think to judge the meeting as a failure without having had the meeting is a weird bar to set. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you take their reason for postponing it at face value?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t sense any lack of cohesion on their part over the tax issue, for example?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, in terms of what their position is?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I can\xe2\x80\x99t presume and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume what their organizational -- what organizational issues that encompasses.\xc2\xa0 I think it probably has to do -- some of it has to do with positioning, sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you just rationalizing this, though, calling this a test?\xc2\xa0 Because typically when the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Call what a test?\xc2\xa0 The meeting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the meeting that is no longer meeting, it\xe2\x80\x99s postponed to something -- another day.\xc2\xa0 But are you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I just for a second, April, though -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the same meeting with the same people at the same location a little bit later.\xc2\xa0 I just --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Particularly in Washington when the President makes a request, you come.\xc2\xa0 Or when the White House makes a request, you come.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And they made a request that we move it because of organizational issues, and we said, sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in a sense, we\xe2\x80\x99ve met the first test of being able to work together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really make the request.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\tThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the request.\xc2\xa0 They said, we\xe2\x80\x99re not coming.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s not exactly how it was --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they said they never agreed to that November 18th date to begin with.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They said that they never agreed to the November 18th date to begin with.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t know the back-and-forth that happened on the phone calls from here.\xc2\xa0 I know that, again, their request was to move the date for their organizational issues around their caucus.\xc2\xa0 We agreed.\xc2\xa0 Bipartisanship has happened.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We agreed that it was inconvenient to have the meeting when we originally set it.\xc2\xa0 We moved it to a different date.\xc2\xa0 There will be a big ceremony on the lawn.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But beyond this initial task, which you passed with flying colors, on bipartisanship, in terms of whether you -- you just said -- whether you have two sides capable of working together, have you been able to make a judgment yet as to whether they are willing to work with you?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are a lot of mixed signals, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve even pointed out some of them.\xc2\xa0 What do you think now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think -- look, I continue to think that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get START done.\xc2\xa0 And again -- I\'ve said this a lot and I\'ll do it again -- if you look at the most recent few START treaties, I think the lowest vote total was 86.\xc2\xa0 Again, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz -- you could name all -- this is\xc2\xa0 -- these are the issues that have and should be done in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 I think there have been 18 hearings on the treaty. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\'s a whole host of things that -- again, I think the test is -- look, the test is going to be what\xe2\x80\x99s the discussion like in that meeting and what happens throughout the rest of the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a better way of looking at it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one -- a question on KSM and where he might be tried, if at all?\xc2\xa0 The White House Counsel has -- will make a decision when?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\'t have any update on when that timing would be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the AfPak meeting today, just to clarify, this is the last one before the review -- December review, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is.\xc2\xa0 And I will say that the bulk of today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting obviously is dedicated to discussions about transition issues as we head to Lisbon tomorrow evening.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the fiscal commission is also meeting --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, transition issues?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t get that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, the transition issues of both security to -- transferring security responsibility for individual provinces that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said will begin in 2011, and also, as we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss at NATO, the notion that by the end of 2014, the Afghans will be in the lead of providing security throughout the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Afghanistan --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me go -- I\'ll come back to Afghanistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fiscal commission is also holding their meeting on November 30, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be voting on a report that you all said is very important.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s also a bipartisan effort. Won\xe2\x80\x99t that basically distract from any meeting you\xe2\x80\x99re having with -- bipartisan meeting you\xe2\x80\x99re having that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be focusing on the legislative agenda?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously believes that the work of the commission is important.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we took an idea, again, that had bipartisan support, but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it passed and did it through an executive order.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you heard the President say last week in Seoul, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important work, he looks forward to receiving the final product that\xe2\x80\x99s voted on, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make some tough decisions as Americans, not as individual parties, about how we make progress on getting our fiscal house in order and making progress on our debt and our deficit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, some of those recommendations are like the third rail -- Social Security, cutting benefits, tax reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to add to what the President said, which is I think to begin to talk about what might be in a report based on a draft report before we see the final report doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President\xe2\x80\x99s close personal friend, Roger Ailes -- (laughter) -- was interviewed on a FOX property recently and said that he thinks the President has not -- \xe2\x80\x9chas not been very successful,\xe2\x80\x9d and has \xe2\x80\x9ca different belief system\xe2\x80\x9d than most people in the country.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you watch most of the programming on that channel, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d find many of those comments to be surprising.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more sort of updated detail on the tax cut negotiations?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House actually negotiating now with Democrats and Republicans, or are you waiting for things like the November 30th meeting or some warm-up, and where are things at exactly?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s doing the negotiating?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of -- I mean, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve had and people in the building have had discussions with Democratic leadership to see what their thoughts are.\xc2\xa0 I think the bulk of these discussions, though, will be had in the bipartisan meeting. I mean, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard what the President -- again, what the President said at the end of the press conference on G20 where he was.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is anything changed or updated since then?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any idea, because of the pushback of the meeting, of how that would affect timing on any resolution?\xc2\xa0 Do you still think the lame duck session is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we have to get it -- I mean, again, as we know, the tax cuts expire at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And the Recovery Act included an AMT patch for tax year 2009.\xc2\xa0 There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a tax year 2010 AMT patch.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that likely is going to have to be addressed --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the more they push it, don\xe2\x80\x99t they prod you into a situation where you may have to agree to some kind of an emergency measure that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to because you\xe2\x80\x99re running out of time and nobody wants the sky to fall?\xc2\xa0 I mean, or do you have a line in the sand that you\xe2\x80\x99re just willing to say --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the sky would fall disproportionately on one rather than all.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I think there is going to be -- there is a strong impetus to get something done by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 There has to be or we find ourselves in a situation where -- that nobody thinks we should be in, and that is watching middle-class families have their tax rates raised.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been movement, Robert, about holding a single vote and even if it fails just to extend the rates for the middle class while letting the upper end expire, which is the preferred position of the White House as I understand it.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House support allowing that single vote to happen even if the numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I, Sam, would have to talk to Leg Affairs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99m --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if there\xe2\x80\x99s an impasse, will the President direct the Treasury and the IRS to keep in place the withholding tables that currently exist for people and all people, or just people under $250,000 --*<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you share that with --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me talk to -- check also with the counsel.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you put the answer on --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll find out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 In the Richard Wolffe book, there was some criticism of Rahm, saying he was excessively tactical, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t implementing decisions efficiently enough.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you or the White House have any thought about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- most of the reading that I do is briefing books and papers for meetings for the next day.\xc2\xa0 I have not read that book.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make it through a pleasure book and it\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly difficult.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which one?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the pleasure book?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Help,\xe2\x80\x9d a fabulous book.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend it to anybody.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d have to see what the quotes are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two loose ends on the meeting.\xc2\xa0 One, I guess the question I have is why did the White House announce a meeting was happening in both of the press conferences and in your week ahead guidance if the people who were to attend the meeting had not accepted the invitation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can go back and try to figure out what the dissonance was.\xc2\xa0 I think our notion was that there was going to be a meeting.\xc2\xa0 They have some organizational issues.\xc2\xa0 Again, I will say this --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Had they told you they were coming?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want to put this frame on this whole thing.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen a little bit into -- we do this on a very day- to-day thing, like oh, my god, there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a meeting. See, I told you this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we all agreed to move a meeting.\xc2\xa0 Like, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 Like, we could be sitting here -- we could dig trenches, we could fire at each other.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to meet.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to meet?\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t do this.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s great theater.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not what happened.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re still planning it to be a meeting followed by a dinner in the residence?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I can check.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On TSA, Robert, please?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll come to you, hold on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President call Reid and Pelosi on Monday to make his commitment firm to extend the tax cuts only for the middle income?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know they spoke.\xc2\xa0 I do not know the outcome of that conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to Tom Donohue pledging to work with you guys?\xc2\xa0 Is this a sign of a truce between the White House and the Chamber of Commerce?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there are issues that we both have in common that we both want to see progress on:\xc2\xa0 issues on trade, issues on jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s enough of an issue set that is important to the American people to make progress on and that we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased and happy to work with them on.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously we did not get a final agreement on Korea -- South Korea free trade agreement because, quite honestly, the agreement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best that we thought we could get.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make progress on that and not get something that is\xc2\xa0 -- we don\'t think is best for us.\xc2\xa0 But we think that\'s an area where -- and there\'s no doubt to get any free trade agreement through Congress, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need bipartisan support in the help of those groups that find it to be important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we -- I don\'t know that the President has<br/>\n\t-- I don\'t believe the President has talked to Senate Collins or Senator Lieberman on this issue.\xc2\xa0 To my knowledge, the study has not come over here.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously it is being finished up by the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates will deliver that to the President.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that this can be done in a way and should be done, as you heard Secretary Gates and others say, in the next few weeks.\xc2\xa0 We ought to bring up and we ought to put this -- we ought to keep this in the defense authorization bill. We ought to pass this in the defense authorization bill.\xc2\xa0 And we ought to end the policy that the courts are rapidly getting close to ending on a timetable that those in the bureaucracy might not find as much to their liking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what do you say to John McCain?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just today you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the START treaty is something that you think will get done and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the taxes are something you have to get done.\xc2\xa0 What category would you put the defense authorization bill in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would put it in the same category.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a\xc2\xa0 -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority for the President to get done before the end of the year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you worried that Senator Reid wants to adjourn on December 10th?\xc2\xa0 That leaves only two weeks after you get done with Thanksgiving.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard or seen a lot of the targeted adjournment stuff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Afghanistan --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The Canadians, after saying over and over that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep soldiers in Afghanistan after 2011, have decided to send 950 military trainers.\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached to Stephen Harper on this issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They had an opportunity to speak on the margins of --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 APEC?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say, look, there are a number of ways that countries can and do participate in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned one -- trainers.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously countries that have contributed those that are on the ground in dangerous regions of the country that are actively fighting.\xc2\xa0 You have countries that have pledged lots of money towards development and reconstruction, which are also important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we would look at -- there are a range of contributions that countries can make, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, Robert, not only Buckingham Palace but all of Great Britain and quite a bit of the U.S. media is aflutter with the coming wedding --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you aflutter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speak for yourself, man.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You should see me -- if this is aflutter, you should see when I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I may have.\xc2\xa0 Anyway -- thank you.\xc2\xa0 The question is, what would the President -- what sage advice, having a successful marriage, would the President offer -- (laughter) -- or maybe even yourself -- in terms of -- (laughter) -- or any official statement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I have a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to impart -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the President would say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Best wishes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he call?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not made any calls -- obviously would wish them well, best wishes.\xc2\xa0 But I have not heard a lot of discussion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you like the ring?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Believe it or not, there\xe2\x80\x99s questions in Great Britain as to when the exact date would be -- spring, summer -- and there are some questions about, it would depend on when the President\xc2\xa0 and First Lady may be coming to accept Her Majesty the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s invitation this coming spring/summer.\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought to that, when that might be?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can look for guidance on the schedule but I have not heard from --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See what we have to do to make a living in this business?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the TSA, does the White House support the actions with the magnetometer and the pat-down, or are you likely to maybe roll back those actions, especially with this chaotic week coming up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say that we have all seen over the course of the past year that there are organizations like al Qaeda that continue with the intent on inflicting harm and damage in this country through airliners.\xc2\xa0 I think what TSA has set up and what the public greatly supports -- I think there was a CBS poll that said four out of five Americans are supportive of increased security to ensure that you feel rightly safe when you get on an airplane.\xc2\xa0 I think the way -- I think TSA administering this in a way that makes the public feel safe and comfortable is important, as well as implementing it to ensure the protection of privacy is important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think there is overwhelming support for ensuring that there is -- that people feel as safe as they can when they get on an airline.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if somebody has a medical condition -- for example, if a woman is pregnant, can they be excused from the magnetometer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- I would point you over to DHS and TSA who will have more granularity on what all that means.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that subject, Robert --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Clyburn\xe2\x80\x99s new position? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask on that subject please?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we talk about Clyburn\xe2\x80\x99s new position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see, which one of you two can yell the loudest?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll yield to her if you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go April, Jackie, there, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on Clyburn\xe2\x80\x99s new position?\xc2\xa0 They even had to create one because of problems on the Hill with the minority leadership and he wanted to bring --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that obviously Congressman Clyburn is somebody that the President greatly respects.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think part of this is when you go from the majority to the minority, you lose a slot.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously ensuring that those that have -- those like Congressman Clyburn that have been instrumental in leadership continue to do so is a good thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jackie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The EU piece of this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s summit is so small that -- how does it affect, or what could you do in that short amount of time, what do you plan to do, now that there\xe2\x80\x99s such a crisis brewing over Ireland that could -- fears are it could reignite the same sort of sovereign debt crisis that occurred in May and which impeded not only the global recovery but the recovery here at home -- so how is that changing the U.S. plans as it goes into this summit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I have no doubt that that will be a topic of discussion.\xc2\xa0 That was something that was also discussed some at the G20 during the conversations that the leaders had.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe, as we did of Greece, that Europe has the ability to deal with the crisis in Ireland and possibly in other countries.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that that will be a topic of conversation at the latter part of the week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lester, and then I\'ll get -- Lester.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Now that the presidential trip to the Far East is concluded, will U.S. taxpayers continue being denied knowledge of how much this trip cost?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Lester, I think we had a nice little colloquy about what you believe and what you don\'t believe --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where you said -- you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us.\xc2\xa0 You said my -- what we heard all over the world was wrong, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us what was right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I don\'t talk about the measures that are taken to protect the President.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- let me finish -- that\'s because the Secret Service doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take those measures -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be in the rare position of offering to share with you a column by Charles Krauthammer on the steps that were taken to -- the steps that we take to ensure any President their safety and security and their ability to move around and conduct foreign policy is the right one, regardless of who that person is. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as I said before we left, Lester, the hotel that we stayed at in Mumbai was what the people in India believe was their 9/11, the attackers coming into and killing innocent people staying in a hotel.\xc2\xa0 So actions were taken to protect -- and are taken to protect any President that travels around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presuming that the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you give an overall cost figure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait a minute, wait a minute --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m following up on your question.\xc2\xa0 How about you give an overall cost figure without giving any of the security steps that are taken?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m told. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, presuming the President supports the Transportation Safety Administration\xe2\x80\x99s pat-down searches of airline passengers and that he believes they will never have male security personnel patting down female passengers, what if any of these male security personnel are not heterosexual? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, lord have mercy. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You sure you want to follow up on his question?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, sorry -- (laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You put a big asterisk -- Lester, I would normally point you to TSA, but I got to tell you, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that TSA, given their charge of protecting people that travel, have a lot of time to deal with whatever on Earth you just asked me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you worked out a deal with Senator Landrieu on her hold on Jack Lew?\xc2\xa0 And how long can the OMB go without a budget director before your budget starts hurting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on the first part of it, see if there has been an update on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the second part of it, I think the real answer to that is, not long at all.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are deadlines that have to be met in this year to get a budget worked through and ultimately get one that can be sent up to Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s work that needs to be going on as soon as possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have an acting director, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that we nominated Jack Lew.\xc2\xa0 We think he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who did the job once very well, helped President Clinton devise a strategy on the fiscal side that brought us from deficit to surplus.\xc2\xa0 So his leadership as the confirmed budget director is tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 I will check with Legislative Affairs --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That suggests that you want the issue dealt with during the lame duck, because you said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We preferred the issue dealt with in September, but absolutely, though, within the lame duck.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the Interstate Recognition of the Notarization Act, the President had pocket-vetoed some time ago.\xc2\xa0 The House I think is going to vote this afternoon to try to override it.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but let me check with Legislative Affairs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I get a quick START follow?\xc2\xa0 Just trying to understand, reading between the lines, is the Democratic position that basically -- or at least the White House position -- to basically call the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 bluff?\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDo you guys really want to stand in the way of START; let\xe2\x80\x99s just call a vote?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Or is it more subtle and a matter of negotiations, and what\xe2\x80\x99s to be negotiated?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 There have been -- Foreign Relations Committee has voted this out.\xc2\xa0 There have been, I think the statement yesterday said, 18 hearings looking into this treaty.\xc2\xa0 There have been countless --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a big surprise yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- countless meetings back and forth.\xc2\xa0 I think in some ways, probably, Margaret, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit between -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be discussions.\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Kerry has spoken with Senator Kyl. I think others have spoken with Senator Kyl.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work through this process.\xc2\xa0 But I think the bottom line is -- it was the very first statement that the Vice President made yesterday -- failure to pass this endangers our national security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we have a real opportunity to get this done, to demonstrate for the American people that the bipartisanship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past on nuclear arms reduction treaties continues in 2010 just as it has in the past.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to work through that and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get not just a vote, but passage on this treaty before the Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you pushing hard to get it done now because you simply wont have the votes next year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pushing hard to get it done now because it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it dead?\xc2\xa0 Is it dead if it gets pushed into next year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get pushed into the next year.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get this done because it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to our security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to our inspection regime. It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to seeing a reduction in those deployed weapons.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to our international relationships. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what makes you so confident?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you seem to think you have the votes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this will get done before the end of the year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that on a plane coming back from Asia as well, sounded so optimistic.\xc2\xa0 What happened between then and yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Senator Kyl speak for Senator Kyl.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- again, I think that -- I think this is a vote that will pass and will -- it has to, based on what you need to pass a treaty, pass in a bipartisan way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of those people you named -- Kissinger, Schultz, Hadley, the others -- which of them are helping behind the scenes to help --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
