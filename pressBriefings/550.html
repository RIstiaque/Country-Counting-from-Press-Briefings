EST</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So we will do this on background as three senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give a little bit of a topper, just to give you guys some flavor, some of which you\xe2\x80\x99re already gotten from Jay and from Eric, on the briefing -- or on the meeting tonight with the King of Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And then I will open it up. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was going to ask you tell us about anything the President may be announcing tonight in terms of deliverables.</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of anything that the President may or may not announce. I think suffice it to say, as everybody knows, Jordan has an extraordinary burden in hosting almost 600,000 refugees from the Syrian crisis.\xc2\xa0 We are constantly engaged in conversations with them about what more we can do to help support their assistance to these refugees and their own budget and economy as they deal with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of anything the President may or may not announce, but suffice it to say it would be a topic of conversation in the meeting tonight.</p>\n<p class="p1">So with that, let me just give you a little bit of a laydown.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as you guys know, the President is going to host a working dinner with King Abdullah this evening at Sunnylands, the Annenberg retreat.\xc2\xa0 Jordan is an invaluable ally, close friend of the United States, and Sunnylands offers a private location, a less formal setting that will allow the President to have a wide-ranging discussion with the King.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">The meeting is really \xe2\x80\x93- hosting him at Sunnylands -- a demonstration of both our partnership with Jordan, the warm friendship that the President has with King Abdullah, and our friendship with the people of Jordan.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s one of the reasons that we picked Sunnylands as a location, as opposed to doing it in Washington where they\xe2\x80\x99ve met on previous occasions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p1">The President looks forward to discussing with King Abdullah opportunities to promote peace, prosperity and reform.\xc2\xa0 I would expect that they will discuss opportunities to strengthen the U.S.-Jordan strategic partnership, how to advance our political, economic and security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And obviously they will continue consultations on Syria and the negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians on finding a durable, comprehensive Middle East peace solution.</p>\n<p class="p1">The President, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note, will have an opportunity to hear from the King about how the King has advanced Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political stability and some of the reforms that he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on since he was last briefed on this by the King in April 2013, when they met, and how the U.S., importantly, can help support the King\xe2\x80\x99s vision for the future of Jordan.</p>\n<p class="p1">The two leaders will also discuss the U.S. commitment to assisting Jordan meet its economic challenges -- and that goes to the question about Syrian refugees in particular.\xc2\xa0 We are committed, as you know, to working with Jordan to support approximately 600,000 Syrian refugees at this point in Jordan and Jordanian host communities, the majority of which now are in host communities as opposed to in the camps.\xc2\xa0 I know that gets sort of a lot of press, but a lot of them are within urban areas in Jordan now also.</p>\n<p class="p1">Jordan and the United States both strongly support the Geneva II process and efforts to find a political solution to the crisis.\xc2\xa0 And I also expect that they will discuss, as the Vice President did earlier this week with the King, the growing threat of extremists \xe2\x80\x93- the extremist threat emanating from the Syrian crisis.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that will be a topic of discussion.</p>\n<p class="p1">Also Jordan is a key stakeholder in the Middle East peace process, as you guys know.\xc2\xa0 And we have deep appreciation for the King\xe2\x80\x99s support for the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So the President and the King will be able to review the status of the talks and our efforts to realize a viable, independent Palestinian state alongside a secure Jewish state of Israel -- two nations enjoying self-determination, security and peace.</p>\n<p class="p1">And again, since we expect this would be wide-ranging, I know some people have asked will they discuss Iran, so I would say yes.\xc2\xa0 I would expect they would touch on the ongoing P5-plus-1 negotiations with Iran to try and reach a comprehensive solution, and the President will have an opportunity to brief the King and sort of bring him up to speed on where we are in that process as well.</p>\n<p class="p1">So with that, that\'s sort of a framework of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I will just open it up for questions and let our two senior administration officials sort of field anything that you have.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much pressure is dealing with the refugee crisis putting on the King\xe2\x80\x99s government?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think quite a significant amount of pressure.\xc2\xa0 As my colleague mentioned, there are almost 600,000 refugees -- Syrian refugees in Jordan.\xc2\xa0 The Jordanian government has had to help support them in Jordan, obviously with help from the international community, but a lot of these refugees are living in Jordanian communities, as my colleague mentioned.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not all in refugee camps.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s put significant strain on the Jordanian economy, which is already under significant pressure even before the Syrian conflict.</p>\n<p class="p1">We also know that the Jordanians face the cutoff of gas from Egypt given that the pipeline has been blown up now several times, which has added to the challenges that Jordan has had meeting its energy demands.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re on track with the IMF agreement that they reached a couple of years ago, which we think is really important.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also tried to do as much as possible. We\xe2\x80\x99ve provided over a billion dollars of assistance in 2012-2013. We\xe2\x80\x99re on track to do the same thing in 2014.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With a B?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Total assistance.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve also urged our other partners to see how they can help the Jordanians, as well -- partners in the Gulf, in Europe and elsewhere -- both as part of an effort to help neighboring states deal with the spillover from the Syrian conflict, but also to help Jordan move forward in its reform agenda, which we strongly support.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us about how significant a portion of the jihadis in Syria now you believe to be Jordanian?\xc2\xa0 How big a problem is that?\xc2\xa0 And is that an issue that the President and the King will discuss tonight?\xc2\xa0 How do you sort of quantify that?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on there?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the breakdown of jihadis in Syria by nationality.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem --</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a significant component, though, right?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 There are jihadists from a variety of Arab countries.\xc2\xa0 There are also jihadists from outside the Arab world who are fighting in Syria, as we know from some of the videos that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that all of the regional governments know they have to address together.</p>\n<p class="p1">We\xe2\x80\x99re working pretty closely with Jordan, with Turkey, with Lebanon, with Iraq to try to not only stem the flow of foreign fighters into Syria, but also to make sure that we interdict young men who intend to travel to Syria to fight in the conflict before they get to that point of trying to smuggle themselves in, basically.</p>\n<p class="p1">The Jordanians have been very good partners, though, on counterterrorism in general.\xc2\xa0 We have a very strong relationship across the board.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been the case for many decades.\xc2\xa0 So I think the conversation between the President and the King is going to be one in which they both share the same goals and will discuss how we can build on the cooperation and support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already offered Jordan to do more together to address this growing threat in Syria.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously the crisis in Syria has a destabilizing effect to some degree on the region.\xc2\xa0 Would you say that effect is getting worse, or it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of destabilizing but it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of at the same level?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Clearly, every day that the conflict in Syria goes on brings with it new challenges for the region as a whole.\xc2\xa0 I think the humanitarian crisis, the growing extremism problem, the burdens that the crisis is imposing on neighboring countries to deal with the refugees, those problems as long as the conflict in Syria continues will continue to grow.</p>\n<p class="p1">And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it a specific focus of our policy to try to help these neighboring countries to deal with these burdens.\xc2\xa0 The President met with the Lebanese President last September in New York and announced a significant increase in U.S. assistance to Lebanon.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with, obviously, the Jordanian King now.\xc2\xa0 We have an ongoing dialogue with the Turks and with the Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 So we understand that this conflict is imposing significant burdens on neighboring countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">We want to work to address those pressures while at the same time, obviously, trying to move forward to resolve the conflict in Syria as quickly as we can, because these issues aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to -- these pressures aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to diminish until the underlying conflict in Syria is resolved.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that, as the President goes into this meeting tonight with the King, that he is now beginning to think about changing the strategy in Syria in some way?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The President has always said that he -- he\xe2\x80\x99s always looking for the best options available with regard to Syria.\xc2\xa0 And ever since this conflict began, I think we have been examining the full range of options.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that the one thing we aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to do is deploy American troops -- deploy boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But short of that, everything else is potentially on the table.</p>\n<p class="p2">And this is a constant process of evaluating where we are with the Geneva negotiations, with the humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 You know about the resolution that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting forward at the U.N. with regard to the problem of extremism in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So we monitor these issues on a daily basis and are in touch with the President about different ideas to address them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s a silver bullet in any of this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is an extremely difficult conflict and there are no easy answers, but I think the President has made clear from the beginning that he wants the best ideas that we can develop in the government.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what Secretary Kerry was referring to the other day.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any of those options more on the table now than they were a month ago?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think what we would say there is the President addressed this in his press conference.\xc2\xa0 He always reserves the right to keep all options on the table, obviously, in the interest of U.S. national security.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to believe that, at this time, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution to this crisis, which is why the emphasis right now is on trying to bring the sides together and foment a political solution and a political transition.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arming the Syrian rebels, for instances, is that under more active consideration now?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know that we have been supporting the Syrian opposition for some time.\xc2\xa0 Back in I think it was April of last year we announced an increase in our support of the opposition to include military support to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 So I think the general category of support to the Syrian opposition is certainly one of the areas that we\xe2\x80\x99ve explored over the past couple of years and I think that will continue to remain on the table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">We have to obviously figure out how to do that in a way that helps advance towards a political solution because, as my colleague said, we don\xe2\x80\x99t see a military solution to this conflict, but helping to improve the position of the Syrian opposition, put pressure on the Syrian regime is certainly part of I think the overall calculation.</p>\n<p class="p1">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress has been funding Jordan at a level that was set six years ago, around $660 million a year, and then putting in all of these add-ons to deal with these sort of crises -- the Iraqi border, the Syrian border.\xc2\xa0 I guess a new -- the next sort of five-year phase is under discussion this year, right?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s belief that the U.S. just needs to plan on giving Jordan more money, period, going forward?\xc2\xa0 Or is this not yet -- are you still sort of weighing that?\xc2\xa0 And are they talking money on this trip?</p>\n<p class="p1">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, we have a five-year memorandum of understanding with Jordan in which the administration agreed to request $660 million a year -- $360 million in ESF, $300 million in FMF.\xc2\xa0 That MOU expires in September of this year.\xc2\xa0 So without getting ahead of what the President and the King may discuss, I think certainly our bilateral relationship, our support for Jordan will be one of the issues that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And I think we have worked with Congress over the past couple of years to increase our support to Jordan because they are facing such tremendous pressure from Syria and from the rest of the region -- I mentioned the pipeline from Egypt as well.\xc2\xa0 So the Syrian conflict I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone expects to conclude in the next few weeks, months.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is not something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be resolved overnight.\xc2\xa0 So that will certainly factor into our calculations about what we need to do to help Jordan weather this challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like he may be asking for more money but you can\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s (Senior Administration Official) just going to let his comments stand where they were.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we know how much it\xe2\x80\x99s costing the Jordanian government to have all these refugees in their country?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 My colleague reminds me that\xc2\xa0 -- was that a U.N. or --</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 -- a USAID estimate this year that it will cost them $900 million in 2014.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- $900 million to cover the cost of dealing with the refugees?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what it will cost Jordan?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Jordan is also facing a $3.2 billion budget deficit in 2014, which could also be exacerbated, depending on what happens with the Egyptian gas, how much they\xe2\x80\x99re able to get this year.\xc2\xa0 It could add billions more to their deficit.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The risk of extremists sort of infiltrating the refugee community in Jordan -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if we have any kind of specifics that we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for in terms of how Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s military and intelligence handles that threat and if we\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied with measures they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to address it.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, first of all, that Jordan is a very strong counterterrorism partner so we work very closely with them on a wide range of issues and I think ensuring that support that we\xe2\x80\x99re both offering to the Syrian refugee community goes to the right people -- refugees that are truly in need -- is certainly one aspect of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">But at the border, there are also screening procedures in place that the U.N. implements to ensure that those who come across really are in need and don\xe2\x80\x99t present a security threat.\xc2\xa0 So I think the Jordanians are very cognizant of this concern and have taken steps to try to address it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very confident of our cooperation with them.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Middle East peace and Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s role in that -- I understand that a big issue with our negotiations with the Palestinians and the Israelis is security along the Jordan border.\xc2\xa0 What are we asking Jordan to do and what have they told us about the security plan they\xe2\x80\x99ve presented?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, so first of all, I mean, Jordan, as you said, has a very important role to play on Middle East peace.\xc2\xa0 King Abdullah, his father have long been some of the most high-profile supporters of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel and King Abdullah has been particularly supportive of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to move these negotiations forward.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s met recently with both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas to try to urge them to make the compromises that are necessary for peace.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s also played a leading role in marshaling support for the Palestinians within the Arab League, which is also very important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">But as you mention, Jordan also has an important role on the ground, given that it shares a border with the West Bank and with Israel.\xc2\xa0 And I think everyone knows that the security arrangements that would accompany a peace agreement are among the most important issues that are being negotiated now.\xc2\xa0 There has always been particular concern about the Jordan Valley, so, without getting into details of the negotiations, Secretary Kerry, General Allen, who has been leading an effort, as you know, to develop ways to address security requirements for both Israel and the Palestinians, have both been working intensively with not only Israel and the PA but also with Jordan to see if there are ways in which these three countries, with our support, can cooperate to ensure that that border is as secure as possible.</p>\n<p class="p2">And again, without going into details, I think the Jordanians have been extremely cooperative and extremely forward-leaning in thinking about different ways that we can achieve that goal that are also compatible with, obviously, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security but also Palestinian sovereignty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama satisfied with anti-corruption efforts inside the King\xe2\x80\x99s government in Jordan?\xc2\xa0 And also, the human rights groups have expressed some concerns about barriers to entry for refugees.\xc2\xa0 If the U.S. is going to help fund these efforts at the border, is the President going to press the King for greater access for refugees into the country?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So on the first count, as my colleague said, I think the President and the King will discuss Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s reform efforts.\xc2\xa0 We strongly supported the King\xe2\x80\x99s reform agenda and want to continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 The King has talked many times, including when he last met with the President in April of last year, about his long-term vision for Jordan as a constitutional monarchy as a model for the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a vision that I think we very much share.\xc2\xa0 And certainly one element of that is the fight against corruption.\xc2\xa0 And there have been some important steps that the Jordanian government has taken -- setting up the National Integrity Commission, moving forward with trials of, in some cases, important figures for corruption.\xc2\xa0 We, I think, want to help Jordan move forward to achieve those goals, and I think this general category of reform is something that the President and the King will discuss tonight.</p>\n<p class="p2">On your question about Syrian refugees, every country takes upon itself obligations to admit refugees in need.\xc2\xa0 Jordan is certainly one of those countries and it\xe2\x80\x99s on the front line of the Syrian conflict.\xc2\xa0 So our assistance to Jordan in dealing with this problem has been predicated on the idea that the border will remain open to legitimate refugees.\xc2\xa0 That will continue to be I think a fundamental part of our cooperation and I think also a fundamental lodestar for Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s efforts with regard to the Syrian conflict.</p>\n<p class="p2">But, clearly, there are tremendous pressures.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to work closely with Jordan, as will other countries, to ensure that they can meet the burden represented by these hundreds of thousands of refugees.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk --</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Two more questions.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- host communities?\xc2\xa0 How does that work?\xc2\xa0 Families taking in families?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So 80 percent of the refugees in Jordan are actually urban refugees, so they\xe2\x80\x99re not in the tented communities.\xc2\xa0 In the beginning of the conflict, you saw a lot of attention on Zaatari as a camp and a lot of Syrians were there, but now they\xe2\x80\x99re being hosted in communities.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re in people\xe2\x80\x99s homes; they\xe2\x80\x99ve set up makeshift tents.\xc2\xa0 And so the burdens that places on host communities in terms of their hospitals, schools, electricity, water, that whole public infrastructure that goes into what would be supporting Jordanian communities also has to now support dramatic increases of population.</p>\n<p class="p2">So our assistance looks not just to help the Syrians that are in now these communities, but also the communities themselves.\xc2\xa0 How do we help make sure the water infrastructure is set so that everyone is able to benefit from water?\xc2\xa0 We have AID programs that have increased school shifts so that students go in the morning and then again in the afternoon.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to think of creative ways to make sure that all of the populations, not just Syrians but also Jordanians, are helped.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. poised to take any Syrian refugees?\xc2\xa0 Like there\xe2\x80\x99s a call for this.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. preparing to make any announcement on that?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is an issue that we are continuing to explore.\xc2\xa0 There are no announcements that I know of that we intend to make right now.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of the pressures on Jordan, from the influx of refugees from Syria and whatever economic or political issues that are going on inside the country -- what is the biggest pressure on Jordan now?\xc2\xa0 Or is a combination -- some sort of combination of the two?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think clearly the conflict in Syria is a tremendous source of pressure because 600,000 refugees in a country that is, 5 million, 6 million -- 10 percent of the population -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a huge burden to take on.\xc2\xa0 But Jordan is also in the process of trying to transition its economy from a donor-based economy that is based on the expectation of donor contributions to one that\xe2\x80\x99s self-sufficient. That\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of their IMF agreement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of their effort to diversify their sources of energy away from reliance just on partners in the Gulf and on Egypt towards other sources of energy, and also to modernize their economy so that Jordan can become a hub for technology, for service industries across the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the King\xe2\x80\x99s vision for putting Jordan on a firm economic as well as political footing for the next 20, 30 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 So just again, this was on background attributable to senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 There is no embargo so you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to use it as soon as you would like.\xc2\xa0 We will produce a transcript.</p>\n<p class="p2">Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p2">END\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:55 P.M.
