CET<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Once again, I want to thank the people of France and President Hollande for their extraordinary hospitality. \xc2\xa0Hosting nearly 200 nations is an enormous task for anybody, but to do so just two weeks after the terrorist attacks here is a remarkable display of resolve.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the first place I visited when I arrived on Sunday night was the Bataclan, so that I could pay my respects on behalf of the American people -- who share the French people\xe2\x80\x99s resolve. \xc2\xa0It was a powerful reminder of the awful human toll of those attacks. \xc2\xa0Our hearts continue to go out to the victims\xe2\x80\x99 families.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut here in Paris, we also see the resilience of the universal values that we share -- libert\xc3\xa9, \xc3\xa9galit\xc3\xa9, fraternit\xc3\xa9. And based on my discussions with President Hollande and other leaders, I am confident that we can continue building momentum -- and adding resources -- to our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, to disrupt plots against America and our allies, and to bring about the political resolution necessary to resolve the situation in Syria and relieve the hardships on the Syrian people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, this has been a quick visit. \xc2\xa0Of course, all visits to Paris seem quick -- you always want to stay a little bit longer. But we have accomplished a lot here. \xc2\xa0I have high hopes that over the next two weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ll accomplish even more.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know some have asked why the world would dedicate some of our focus right now to combating climate change even as we work to protect our people and go after terrorist networks. \xc2\xa0The reason is because this one trend -- climate change<br/>\n\t-- affects all trends. \xc2\xa0If we let the world keep warming as fast as it is, and sea levels rising as fast as they are, and weather patterns keep shifting in more unexpected ways -- then before long, we are going to have to devote more and more and more of our economic and military resources not to growing opportunity for our people, but to adapting to the various consequences of a changing planet. This is an economic and security imperative that we have to tackle now. \xc2\xa0And great nations can handle a lot at once.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAmerica is already leading on many issues, and climate is no different. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress at home -- increasing production of clean energy, working to reduce emissions, while our businesses have kept creating jobs for 68 straight months. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve been able to lower our unemployment rate to 5 percent in the process. \xc2\xa0And since we worked with China last year to show that the two largest economies and two largest emitters can cooperate on climate, more than 180 countries have followed our lead in announcing their own targets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe task that remains here in Paris is to turn these achievements into an enduring framework for progress that gives the world confidence in a low-carbon future. \xc2\xa0As I said yesterday, what we seek is an agreement where progress paves the way for countries to update their emissions targets on a regular basis, and each nation has the confidence that other nations are meeting their commitments. \xc2\xa0We seek an agreement that makes sure developing nations have the resources they need to skip the dirty phase of development if they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do their part, and that makes sure the nations most vulnerable to climate change have resources to adapt to the impacts we can no longer avoid.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe seek an agreement that gives businesses and investors the certainty that the global economy is on a firm path towards a low-carbon future, because that will spur the kind of investment that will be vital to combine reduced emissions with economic growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the goal. \xc2\xa0Not just an agreement to roll back the pollution that threatens our planet, but an agreement that helps our economies grow and our people to thrive without condemning the next generation to a planet that is beyond its capacity to repair.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, all of this will be hard. \xc2\xa0Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be moments over the next two weeks where progress seems stymied, and everyone rushes to write that we are doomed. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get big things done here. \xc2\xa0Keep in mind, nobody expected that 180 countries would show up in Paris with serious climate targets in hand. \xc2\xa0Nobody expected that the price of clean energy would fall as fast as it has, or that back in the United States, the solar industry would be creating jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy. \xc2\xa0Nobody expected that more than 150 of America\xe2\x80\x99s biggest companies would pledge their support to an ambitious Paris outcome -- or that a couple dozen of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest private citizens would join us here to pledge to invest unprecedented resources to bring clean energy technologies to market faster.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat gives me confidence that progress is possible is somebody like Bill Gates -- who I was with yesterday -- understands that tackling climate change is not just a moral imperative, it\'s an opportunity. \xc2\xa0Without batting an eye, he said we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to go ahead and invent some new technologies to tackle this challenge. \xc2\xa0That kind of optimism, that kind of sense that we can do what is necessary is infectious. \xc2\xa0And you tend to believe somebody like Bill when he says that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get it done -- since he\xe2\x80\x99s done some pretty remarkable things. \xc2\xa0And I believe that a successful two weeks here could give the world that same kind of optimism that the future is ours to shape.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, with that, I\'m going to take a few questions. \xc2\xa0We\'ll start with Jerome Cartillier of *AP AFP. \xc2\xa0Where\xe2\x80\x99s Jerome?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Good morning, sir, and thank you, Mr. President. \xc2\xa0For months now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking Mr. Putin to play basically a more constructive role in Syria, basically shifting from defending Assad to attacking ISIL. \xc2\xa0It appears your calls have not been heard. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your strategy going forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not sure that\'s true. \xc2\xa0The fact that the Vienna process is moving forward, steadily -- not conclusively, but steadily -- I think is an indication that Mr. Putin recognizes there is not going to be a military resolution to the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Russians now have been there for several weeks, over a month, and I think fair-minded reporters who looked at the situation would say that the situation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed significantly. \xc2\xa0In the interim, Russia has lost a commercial passenger jet. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen another jet shot down. \xc2\xa0There have been losses in terms of Russian personnel. \xc2\xa0And I think Mr. Putin understands that, with Afghanistan fresh in the memory, for him to simply get bogged down in a inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, where we continue to have an ongoing difference is not on the need for a political settlement; it\'s the issue of whether Mr. Assad can continue to serve as President while still bringing the civil war to an end. \xc2\xa0It\'s been my estimation for five years now that that\'s not possible. \xc2\xa0Regardless of how you feel about Mr. Assad -- and I consider somebody who kills hundreds of thousands of his own people illegitimate -- but regardless of the moral equation, as a practical matter, it is impossible for Mr. Assad to bring that country together and to bring all the parties into an inclusive government. \xc2\xa0It is possible, however, to preserve the Syrian state, to have an inclusive government in which the interests of the various groups inside of Syria are represented.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so, as part of the Vienna process, you\'re going to see the opposition groups -- the moderate opposition groups that exist within Syria -- some of which, frankly, we don\'t have a lot in common with but do represent significant factions inside of Syria -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming together in order for them to form at least a negotiating unit or process that can move Vienna forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we\'re going to just keep on working at this. \xc2\xa0And my hope and expectation is, is that political track will move at the same time as we continue to apply greater and greater pressure on ISIL.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with the contributions that the French have made, the Germans have recently announced additional resources to the fight, the Brits have been steady partners in Iraq and I think are now very interested in how they can expand their efforts to help deal with ISIL inside of Syria -- with not just the cohesion of the coalition the United States put together but also the increasing intensity of our actions in the air and progressively on the ground, I think it is possible over the next several months that we both see a shift in calculation in the Russians and a recognition that it\'s time to bring the civil war in Syria to a close.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\'s not going to be easy. \xc2\xa0Too much blood has been shed, too much infrastructure has been destroyed, too many people have been displaced, for us to anticipate that it will be a smooth transition. \xc2\xa0And ISIL is going to continue to be a deadly organization -- because of its social media, the resources that it has and the networks of experienced fighters that it possesses -- is going to continue to be a serious threat for some time to come. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we are on the winning side of this and that, ultimately, Russia is going to recognize the threat that ISIL poses to its country, to its people, is the most significant, and that they need to align themselves with those of us who are fighting ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJustin Sink.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Mr. President. \xc2\xa0I guess I wanted to follow on that shift in calculation that you discussed in terms of President Putin. \xc2\xa0Did you receive assurances from either him or President Hollande -- who said earlier this week that President Putin had told him he would only target jihadis and ISIS -- that that will be the focus of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military campaign going forward?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, separately, I just wanted to ask about climate. \xc2\xa0The outstanding issue seems to be whether Republicans who have kind of voiced opposition to your agenda could somehow submarine funding for the Green Climate Fund. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty crucial part here. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering both how you prevent that in the upcoming appropriations process, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re at all concerned about what Senator McConnell said earlier today or yesterday that a future Republican President could undo what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to accomplish here in Paris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA: \xc2\xa0First of all, on Mr. Putin, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a 180-turn on their strategy over the next several weeks. \xc2\xa0They have invested for years now in keeping Assad in power. \xc2\xa0Their presence there is predicated on propping him up. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time for them to change how they think about the issue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so long as they are aligned with the regime, a lot of Russian resources are still going to be targeted at opposition groups that ultimately are going to end up being part of an inclusive government that we support or other members of the coalition support, and are fighting the regime and fighting ISIL at the same time. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should be under any illusions that somehow Russia starts hitting only ISIL targets. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not happening now. \xc2\xa0It was never happening. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be happening in the next several weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat can happen is if the political process that John Kerry has so meticulously stitched together -- in concert with Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia -- if that works in Vienna, then it\xe2\x80\x99s possible, given the existing accord that the parties have already agreed to, that we start seeing at least pockets of ceasefires in and around Syria. \xc2\xa0That may mean then that certain opposition groups no longer find themselves subject to either Syrian or Russian bombing; they are then in a conversation about politics. And slowly, we then are able to get everybody\xe2\x80\x99s attention diverted to where it needs to be, and that is going after ISIL in a systematic way.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to climate and what\xe2\x80\x99s taking place here, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of ourselves -- we still need a Paris agreement. \xc2\xa0And so my main focus is making sure that the United States is a leader in bringing a successful agreement home here in Paris. \xc2\xa0And there are a number of components to it. \xc2\xa0So I just want to repeat so that everybody understands what we will consider success several weeks from now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber one, that it is an ambitious target that seeks a low-carbon global economy over the course of this century. \xc2\xa0That means that countries have put forward specific targets, and although those are self-generating, there is a mechanism in which they are presenting to the world confirmation that they are working on those targets, meeting on those targets. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a single transparency mechanism that all countries are adhering to, and that those are legally binding; that there\xe2\x80\x99s periodic reviews so that as the science changes and as technology changes, five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now -- in each successive cycle, countries can update the pledges that they make; and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a climate fund that helps developing countries to not only adapt and mitigate but also leapfrog over dirty-power generation in favor of clean energy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if we hit those targets, then we will have been successful. \xc2\xa0Not because, by the way, the pledges alone will meet the necessary targets for us to prevent catastrophic climate change, but because we will have built the architecture that\xe2\x80\x99s needed. \xc2\xa0We will have established a global consensus of how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to approach the problem. \xc2\xa0And then we can successfully turn up the dials as new sources of energy become available, as the unit costs for something like solar or improvements in battery technology make it easier for us to meet even higher targets. \xc2\xa0And systematically, we can drive down carbon emissions and the pace of climate change over the course of several decades.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I want to emphasize this because I know that in some of the reporting -- if you add up all the pledges and they were all met right now, we would be at a estimated 2.7 centigrade increase in temperature. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s too high. \xc2\xa0We wanted to get 2 centigrade or even lower than that. \xc2\xa0But if we have these periodic reviews built in, what I believe will happen is that by sending that signal to researchers and scientists and investors and entrepreneurs and venture funds, we\xe2\x80\x99ll actually start hitting these targets faster than we expected, and we can be even more ambitious. \xc2\xa0And so when you look at the cumulative targets that may exist 10 years from now, we may well be within the 2 percent centigrade increase.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd by the way, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just foolish optimism. \xc2\xa0When you look at the experience of the United States, for example -- I came into office, I prioritized clean energy, I said we\xe2\x80\x99re going to double our clean energy production. \xc2\xa0Through the Recovery Act, we recognized that making these big investments were also good for the economy and helping us get out of recession and could create jobs. \xc2\xa0So we made a big investment, and it turned out that we met our goals a lot quicker than we expected.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you had asked me when I first came into office my expectations for the price of solar-generated power versus traditional coal or other fossil-fuel-generated power, I would say we would make some progress but that solar would still require substantial subsidies in order to be economical. \xc2\xa0The cost of solar has gone down much faster than any of us would have predicted even five years ago.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the key here is to set up the structure so that we\xe2\x80\x99re sending signals all around the world: \xc2\xa0This is happening. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not turning back. \xc2\xa0And the thing about human ingenuity -- I was going to say American ingenuity, but there are other smart folks around too, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be too parochial about this -- the thing about human ingenuity is, is that it responds when it gets a strong signal of what needs to be done.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe old expression that necessity is the mother of invention -- well, this is necessary. \xc2\xa0And us getting a strong, high-ambition agreement in place, even if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet all the goals that we ultimately need to meet, sends a signal that it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary and that will spur on the innovation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to ultimately meet our goals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNancy Benac.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Mr. President. \xc2\xa0One follow-up on the climate change issue. \xc2\xa0Are you confident that you can hold the U.S. to its commitments under existing treaties with no new vote needed? And separately, on Planned Parenthood, I wondered if you could share your thoughts on that shooting, and any thoughts in the context of the sharp political rhetoric in the country at this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA: \xc2\xa0I apologize, Justin, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t address that but, fortunately, Nancy was batting cleanup after you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the issue of the climate fund, we already engage in assistance to countries for adaptation, mitigation, sharing technology that can help them meet their energy needs in a clean way. \xc2\xa0And so this is not just one slug of funding that happens in one year -- this is multiyear commitments that, in many cases, are already embedded in a whole range of programs that we have around the world. \xc2\xa0And my expectation is, is that we will absolutely be able to meet our commitments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is part of American leadership, by the way. \xc2\xa0And this is part of the debate that we have to have in the United States more frequently.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFor some reason, too often in Washington, American leadership is defined by whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re sending troops somewhere, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the sole definition of leadership. \xc2\xa0And part of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to describe during the course of my presidency is that where we make the most impact -- and where, by the way, we strengthen our relationships and influence the most -- is when we are helping to organize the world around a particular problem.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, because we\xe2\x80\x99re the largest country, because we have the most powerful military, we should welcome the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do more and oftentimes we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it first. \xc2\xa0So during the Ebola response, other countries could not respond until we had set up the infrastructure to allow other countries to respond, and until we had made the call and showed that we were going to make that investment.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe same was true with respect to making sure that Iran didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0We had to lead the way, but, ultimately, because we reached out and brought our allies and partners together, we were able to achieve goals that we could not have achieved by ourselves.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe same is true with climate. \xc2\xa0When I made the announcement in Beijing with President Xi, I was able to do so in part because we had led domestically, so I could put my money where my mouth was, and I said, here are the tough political decisions we\xe2\x80\x99re making, now what are you going to do? \xc2\xa0And once we were able to get China involved that gave confidence to other countries that we were in a position to make a difference as well -- or that they needed to be involved in the process as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo whether it\xe2\x80\x99s organizing the coalition that\xe2\x80\x99s fighting ISIL, or dealing with climate change, our role is central, but on large international issues like this, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be sufficient -- at least not if we want it to take, if we want it to sustain itself. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have partners. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of leadership that we should aspire to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to Planned Parenthood, obviously my heart goes out to the families of those impacted. \xc2\xa0I mean, Nancy, I say this every time we\xe2\x80\x99ve got one of these mass shootings -- this just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in other countries.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are, rightly, determined to prevent terrorist attacks wherever they occur, whether in the United States or with friends and allies like France. \xc2\xa0And we devote enormous resources -- and properly so -- to rooting out networks and debilitating organizations like ISIL, and maintaining the intelligence and improving the information-sharing that can identify those who would try to kill innocent people. \xc2\xa0And yet, in the United States, we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides that is unequalled by multiples of 5, 6, 10.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the American people understand that. \xc2\xa0So my hope is, is that, once again, this spurs a conversation and action. \xc2\xa0And I will continue to present those things that I can do administratively. \xc2\xa0But in the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies from getting weapons that can magnify the damage that they do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with respect to Planned Parenthood, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it before -- they provide health services to women all across the country. \xc2\xa0Have for generations. \xc2\xa0In many cases, it\xe2\x80\x99s the only organization that provides health services to impoverished women. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to have a legitimate, honest debate about abortion. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that is beyond the pale of our political discussion; I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious, legitimate issue. \xc2\xa0How we talk about it -- making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about it factually, accurately, and not demonizing organizations like Planned Parenthood -- I think is important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff Mason.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Mr. President. \xc2\xa0Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria? \xc2\xa0How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has, has not sealed its border? \xc2\xa0And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, to put a finer point on the climate change question, can leaders gathered here believe that the United States will keep its commitments, even after you\xe2\x80\x99ve left office, if a Republican succeeds you in the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA: \xc2\xa0Just with respect to my successor, let me, first of all, say that I\xe2\x80\x99m anticipating a Democrat succeeding me. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident in the wisdom of the American people on that front.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut even if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things that you find is when you\xe2\x80\x99re in this job, you think about it differently than when you\xe2\x80\x99re just running for the job. \xc2\xa0And what you realize is what I mentioned earlier, that American leadership involves not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you now are, in fact, at the center of what happens around the world, and that your credibility and America\xe2\x80\x99s ability to influence events depends on taking seriously what other countries care about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the fact of the matter is there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why you have the largest gathering of world leaders probably in human history here in Paris. \xc2\xa0Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously. \xc2\xa0They think it\xe2\x80\x99s a really big problem. \xc2\xa0It spans political parties. \xc2\xa0You travel around Europe, and you talk to leaders of governments and the opposition, and they are arguing about a whole bunch of things -- one thing they\xe2\x80\x99re not arguing about is whether the science of climate change is real and whether or not we have to do something about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo whoever is the next President of the United States, if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus -- not just 99.5 percent of scientists and experts, but 99 percent of world leaders -- think this is really important, I think the President of the United States is going to need to think this is really important. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to not project what\xe2\x80\x99s being said on a campaign trail, but to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right, and make the case.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I would note that the American people, I think in the most recent survey, two-thirds of them said America should be a signatory to any agreement that emerges that is actually addressing climate change in a serious way. \xc2\xa0So the good news is, the politics inside the United States is changing, as well. \xc2\xa0Sometimes it may be hard for Republicans to support something that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing, but that\xe2\x80\x99s more a matter of the games Washington plays. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think people should be confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet our commitments on this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to Turkey, I have had repeated conversations with President Erdogan about the need to close the border between Turkey and Syria. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some serious progress on that front, but there are still some gaps. \xc2\xa0In particular, there\xe2\x80\x99s about 98 kilometers that are still used as a transit point for foreign fighters, ISIL shipping out fuel for sale that helps finance their terrorist activities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we have been having our militaries work together to determine how a combination of air and Turkish ground forces on the Turkish side of the border can do a much better job of sealing the border than currently is. \xc2\xa0And I think President Erdogan recognizes that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m also encouraged by the fact that President Erdogan and the EU had a series of meetings around -- or Turkey and the EU had a series of meetings around the issue of the Turkish-Greek border.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have to remind ourselves, Turkey has taken on an enormous humanitarian effort. \xc2\xa0There are millions of Syrians who are displaced and living inside of Turkey -- not just refugee camps, but they are now moving into major cities throughout Turkey. \xc2\xa0That puts enormous strains on their infrastructure, on their housing, on employment. \xc2\xa0And Turkey has continued to keep those borders open for people in real need.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m proud that the United States is the single-largest contributor of humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that the EU is looking to do more to help Turkey manage those refugee flows. \xc2\xa0But I also think the EU, rightly, wants to see the kind of orderly process along the Turkish-Greek border that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for Europe to be able to regulate the amount of refugees it\xe2\x80\x99s absorbing, and to save the lives of refugees who are oftentimes taking enormous risks because they\xe2\x80\x99re being ferried back and forth by human traffickers who are now operating in the same ways that you see drug traffickers operating under -- at enormous profit, and without regard for human life.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you raise the border issue with him today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA: \xc2\xa0We talked about it today, but I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, Jeff, is this has been an ongoing conversation. \xc2\xa0We recognize that this is a central part of our anti-ISIL strategy. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to choke them off. \xc2\xa0We have to choke off how they make money. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to choke off their ability to bring in new fighters. \xc2\xa0Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken tens of thousands of their fighters off the battlefield, but if new ones are still coming in, then they continue to maintain a stranglehold over certain population centers inside of Iraq or Syria. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to cut off their source of new fighters.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s also part of the great danger for Europe, and ultimately the United States, as well, and countries as far-flung as Australia or Singapore. \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got foreign fighters coming in that are getting not only ideologically hardened but battle-hardened, and then they\xe2\x80\x99re returning to their home countries, they\xe2\x80\x99re likely candidates for engaging in the kind of terrorist attacks that we saw here in Paris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this has been ongoing concern and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to push hard among all our allies to cut off the financing, cut off the foreign fighters, improve our intelligence-gathering, which has allowed us to accelerate the strikes that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking against ISIL.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tA lot of the discussion over the last couple of weeks was the pace of airstrikes. \xc2\xa0The pace of airstrikes is not constrained by the amount of planes or missiles that we have; the pace has been dictated by how many effective targets do we have. And our intelligence continues to improve. \xc2\xa0And the better we get at that, the better we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be at going after them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tScott Horsley.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Mr. President. \xc2\xa0In terms of sending that market signal you talked about today and a couple of times this week, I wonder if you see any political path back home towards putting an explicit price on carbon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA: \xc2\xa0I have long believed that the most elegant way to drive innovation and to reduce carbon emissions is to put a price on it. \xc2\xa0This is a classic market failure. \xc2\xa0If you open up an Econ101 textbook, it will say the market is very good about determining prices and allocating capital towards its most productive use -- except there are certain externalities, there are certain things that the market just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t price, at least not on its own. \xc2\xa0Clean air is an example. \xc2\xa0Clean water -- or the converse -- dirty water, dirty air.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn this case, the carbons that are being sent up that originally we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the science to fully understand -- we do now. \xc2\xa0And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, if you put a price on it, then the entire market would respond. \xc2\xa0And the best investments and the smartest technologies would begin scrubbing effectively our entire economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. \xc2\xa0And so I think that as the science around climate change is more accepted, as people start realizing that even today you can put a price on the damage that climate change is doing -- you go down to Miami, and when it\xe2\x80\x99s flooding at high tide on a sunny day and fish are swimming through the middle of the streets, there\xe2\x80\x99s a cost to that. \xc2\xa0Insurance companies already are beginning to realize that in terms of how they price risk. \xc2\xa0And the more the market on its own starts putting a price on it because of risk, it may be that the politics around setting up a cap-and-trade system, for example, shifts as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, I\xe2\x80\x99m not under any illusion that this Congress will impose something like that. \xc2\xa0But it is worth remembering that it was conservatives and Republicans and center-right think tanks that originally figured out this was a smarter way to deal with pollution than a command-and-control system. \xc2\xa0And it was folks like George H.W. Bush and his EPA that effectively marshalled this approach to deal with acid raid. \xc2\xa0We ended up solving it a lot faster, a lot cheaper than anybody had anticipated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I guess, more than anything, that\xe2\x80\x99s the main message I want to send here, is climate change is a massive problem. \xc2\xa0It is a generational problem. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that, by definition, is just about the hardest thing for any political system to absorb, because the effects are gradual, they\xe2\x80\x99re diffuse; people don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it immediately and so there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of constituency pressure on politicians to do something about it right away, it kind of creeps up on you. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the problem of the commons and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get everybody doing it -- because if just one nation is helping but the other nations aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing it, then it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do any good -- so you have this huge coordination problem and the danger of free riders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo on all these dimensions, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to come up with a tougher problem than climate change -- or a more consequential problem.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd yet, despite all that, the main message I\xe2\x80\x99ve got is, I actually think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve this thing. \xc2\xa0If you had said to people as recently as two years ago that we\xe2\x80\x99d have 180 countries showing up in Paris with pretty ambitious targets for carbon reduction, most people would have said you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pipe dream. \xc2\xa0And yet, here we are. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s already happened. \xc2\xa0Before the agreement is even signed, that\xe2\x80\x99s already happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I said earlier, if you had told folks what the cost of generating solar energy would be today relative to what it was five years ago, people would have said, not a chance. \xc2\xa0And with relatively modest inputs, that\xe2\x80\x99s already happening. \xc2\xa0I mean, imagine if we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to put more R&amp;D dollars into it -- which is why the Mission Innovation announcement was so significant -- the biggest countries, the most prosperous countries doubling their R&amp;D, but then you\xe2\x80\x99ve also got Bill Gates and other extraordinarily wealthy individuals saying we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put our money into this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic. \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve it. \xc2\xa0I think the issue is just going to be the pace and how much damage is done before we are able to fully apply the brakes.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in some ways, it\xe2\x80\x99s akin to the problem of terrorism and ISIL. \xc2\xa0In the immediate aftermath of a terrible attack like happened here in Paris, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s natural for people to despair. \xc2\xa0But look at Paris. \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t tear down Paris because of the demented actions of a handful individuals. \xc2\xa0The beauty, the joy, the life, the culture, the people, the diversity -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to win out every time.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we have to be steady in applying pressure to the problem. \xc2\xa0We have to keep on going at it. \xc2\xa0We have to see what works. \xc2\xa0When something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, we have to change our approach. \xc2\xa0But most of all, we have to push away fear, and have confidence that human innovation, our values, our judgment, our solidarity -- it will win out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at this long enough where I have some cause for confidence. \xc2\xa0We went, what, a month, month and a half, where people were pretty sure that Ebola was going to kill us all? \xc2\xa0Well, nobody asks me about it anymore. \xc2\xa0And although we still see flickers of it in West Africa, we set up an entire global health security agenda -- part of American leadership -- to deal not only with Ebola but to deal with the possibility of future pandemics. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. \xc2\xa0It takes time. \xc2\xa0And when you\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of it, it\xe2\x80\x99s frightening. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s solvable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAll right? \xc2\xa0With that, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go home. \xc2\xa0Vive la France! \xc2\xa0Thank you very much. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:55 P.M.
