GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xc2\xa0 How are you guys?\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re going to land soon, so I -- looks like it.\xc2\xa0 How are you guys?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we ask you about -- we hear Goldman Sachs folks that will be in the audience today, including the head of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to get an updated list.\xc2\xa0 I think different attendees were changing, so I think several were invited, including I think the CEO and the COO -- I\'ll make sure I have those titles right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s Blankfein and Cohn?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 But let me get a confirmed list when we get on the ground and we have a little bit of a better sense, like I said, as schedules were changing.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get an updated list for you -- and try to get a more comprehensive list, because there\xe2\x80\x99s about 700 people in the audience; several hundred are from the school, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good cross-section of people throughout this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I will just say one other thing.\xc2\xa0 This is -- this was never scheduled for or intended to be a speech to five or six CEOs.\xc2\xa0 It is a speech -- certainly there are messages in there for Wall Street, there are messages in there for Main Street, about the need to get this legislation, strong Wall Street reform done this year, because we know what happens if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get something done -- the same rules that got us into this mess are in place to get us into a mess again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any CEOs that are going?\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with the Wall Street firms and it seems like there are risk officers and CFOs, but we don\'t know of any CEOs --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a better list for you on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would, again, underscore that the speech wasn\xe2\x80\x99t intended to gather CEOs and speak directly to them; it\xe2\x80\x99s intended to speak to the country writ large about the importance of this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments on derivatives meant to be an endorsement of the Senate agriculture bill that passed yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Jonathan, we have at the very beginning of this process identified the need for regulation and transparency of financial instruments, including derivatives.\xc2\xa0 And that was in the white paper that the administration sent up last year.\xc2\xa0 The bill that passed the Senate Ag Committee yesterday -- as I understand it, there will be meetings to take bills that Senator Dodd has and Senator Lincoln has that have a lot of overlap and merge all those together.</p>\n<p>Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak extensively about ensuring that this bill takes those instruments out of the dark into the light of day and puts them in something that regulates their activities for all to see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the Ag Committee bill do that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are aspects of each I think that have pluses and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through them and merge those bills together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all concerned that if you regulate derivatives in this way, that a lot of them will go offshore and then be off the books and even in darker, blacker places?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?\xc2\xa0 You mean if you -- I mean, obviously, our original proposal puts them into a regulated exchange.\xc2\xa0 So in fact --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if you take the Lincoln language, then banks will have a lot of -- have their international consortiums do a lot of this and it will be offshore.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the best thing to do is for us to have\xc2\xa0 -- we\'ll have a better sense of some of this once all these proposals get worked through.\xc2\xa0 I do think overall we\xe2\x80\x99re making a lot of progress on the legislation.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at, for instance, the Consumer Finance Protection Agency I think, quite frankly, is in a far stronger position than it may have been even two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>So I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re on the precipice of taking, as the Secretary said this morning, some genuinely historic steps in reforming the way Wall Street and our financial system work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you consider the Dodd bill essentially a done deal at this point?\xc2\xa0 I mean, a lot of people seem very optimistic that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say we seem very optimistic.\xc2\xa0 I think you have seen statements from Republicans, well, quite frankly, well into last week that -- I think they want -- I think there are some that want to get something done and I think that only gets stronger as the days go on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the criticisms of Republicans is that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on Fannie or Freddie in these reforms.\xc2\xa0 Treasury Secretary Geithner, who was asked about that on a television program earlier today, said that there is something in the works. What\xe2\x80\x99s in the works?\xc2\xa0 How far along is it?\xc2\xa0 When might we see it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, specifically, we wanted to get something focused on what we had seen on Wall Street and what caused many of the calamities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with over the last two years through this process as Treasury works on additional measures.\xc2\xa0 Let me get an update from Treasury on where exactly they see that being.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why the President\xe2\x80\x99s strong comments for free markets?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like some of his rhetoric has gone a little too far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I point you -- I think the best way to show where the President has been on this issue is not to look at what the excerpts say today, but look at what the President said in 2007 standing at NASDAQ as a candidate; look at what the President said at Cooper Union in 2008.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a remarkable similarity in the way the President has talked about this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President, again, going back to 2007, was very clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s a strong believer in our capital system, that we have to have a strong free market.\xc2\xa0 The only way that works is with some real common-sense rules that don\xe2\x80\x99t allow people to take advantage of the system, and that that system, when it gets taken advantage of, hands the bill to the American taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President warned about in 2007 and in 2008.\xc2\xa0 We come here in 2010 I think on the cusp of real progress to ensure that what the President has warned about for years doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come again to pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So today isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dialing back of his rhetoric?\xc2\xa0 This is all like a consistent, steady thread?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, don\xe2\x80\x99t take my words for it -- take the President\xe2\x80\x99s words for it dating back to 2007.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re so good at parsing his words and calibrating them for us.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think if you read only a few lines of each of those speeches, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that for the better part of more than three years, even as the President warned about things that -- look, I\'ll be the first one to tell you, google the text of the speech for the NASDAQ, because I can assure you there weren\xe2\x80\x99t this many reporters -- and there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight of you all that I\'m talking to, for the purposes of people reading this transcript -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to fight for press space in the 2007 speech warning of loose regulation.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a ton of interest in it.\xc2\xa0 I think there is now because what we\'ve seen happen.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a remarkable consistency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on immigration, given the amount of time left before the political calendar really starts ticking --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One can say that\'s already -- that clock has been ticking for about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that immigration or energy should be the next major thing up before Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'ll be honest with you, Jonathan, the way we\'re going to get either of those things done is through bipartisan proposals.\xc2\xa0 Senators Graham and Schumer are working on -- among others -- are working on comprehensive immigration legislation.\xc2\xa0 Senators Kerry, Lieberman and Graham are working on -- with others -- comprehensive energy legislation.\xc2\xa0 I think in order to get either of those things through we\'re going to need leadership from both parties.\xc2\xa0 So the President has been working with both groups in trying to help those processes along.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I do think there\xe2\x80\x99s time to get more done.\xc2\xa0 We will watch gas prices rise again as we get into summer and see the desire and need again to take additional steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 And as I talked about yesterday, the President made some phone calls on this plane a few days ago to try to get additional support for immigration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about energy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, he has, and the team have met with those senators as they finish up their proposal to move forward.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think that -- I wouldn\'t rule anything out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any update that you can give us on phone calls he\xe2\x80\x99s made on financial regulatory reform in the last 24 hours?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing new on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he reached out to anyone in Louisiana over the oil rig explosion?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe so, but\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might he?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 well, I know that the Department of Interior and I think the Deputy Secretary were headed -- either down there or headed down there because that falls under the Department of Interior\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me go sit down before we start surfing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, no vat tax?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, no vat tax.</p>\n<p>Yes, you have one more?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yes.\xc2\xa0 South Korea is saying that they believe North Korea is responsible behind that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am going to go sit down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to get back to me on that?</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n11:06 A.M.
