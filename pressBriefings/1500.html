Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  10:58 A.M. EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Oh, Mr. McCormick, a special appearance.\xc2\xa0 Wow.<br/> <br/>  We\'re doing this a little early today so you all can watch the President\'s events or travel, as you maybe needed to do.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Before we take our regularly scheduled questions, we\'ll hear from Secretary Sebelius, who will talk to you all about some demonstration projects and grants and a program that the President, as you know, during the recent joint session of Congress, asked her to look into regarding medical malpractice.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I will turn it over to the Secretary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY SEBELIUS:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday of this week, we received the latest evidence that the health care system is simply unsustainable.\xc2\xa0 The Kaiser Family Foundation came out with a new study showing that, for families, health insurance premiums rose from under $6,000 to over $13,000 in the last 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And a second report from the Business Roundtable focused on companies which show that -- they estimate companies will pay over $28,000 in health care costs for each employee in the next 10 years.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So you heard from the President a week ago, who outlined a plan to move in a new direction, providing security and stability to Americans who have coverage, and affordable coverage to those who don\'t, and raise the quality for all Americans; slow the rising costs for families, businesses, and government.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But as part of that new direction, he directed me, as Secretary of Health and Human Services, to move forward on medical liability demonstration projects that put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing medicine.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Now, this is an area we know we can do better.\xc2\xa0 As many as 98,000 Americans die every year from medical errors.\xc2\xa0 And though malpractice premiums themselves count for only a small percentage of total medical costs, many doctors report that they practice costly defensive medicine because they are fearful of lawsuits.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So reflecting these concerns, the presidential memorandum that I received today directs my Department to make $25 million in grants available to states, localities, and health systems to try out new patient safety and medical liability models.\xc2\xa0 Grants are going to be available for the development, implementation, and evaluation of models that do four things:\xc2\xa0 put patient safety first and work to reduce preventable injuries; foster better communication between doctors and their patients; ensure that patients are compensated in a fair and timely manner for medical injuries, while reducing the incidence of frivolous lawsuits; and finally, reduce liability premiums.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Now, those goals are consistent with the principles identified by the joint commission and the Institute of Medicine, and the goals that were contained in the legislation that President Obama as a senator introduced in 2005 with then-Senator Hillary Clinton.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'re moving forward on the projects immediately, as the President requested.\xc2\xa0 Within 30 days, we\'ll post an official funding opportunity announcement on grants.gov.\xc2\xa0 After that, potential grantees will have 60 days to apply for two different kinds of grants -- one-year planning grants of up to $300,000 that will help states and localities and health systems develop and conceptualize new patient safety and medical liability models; and demonstration grants for up to three years and $3 million that will help implementation of projects that are ready to go.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We -- at the same time that the grant applications are being submitted, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will be conducting a review of what is currently in place throughout the United States and what evidence there is that has been gathered about what works and doesn\'t work.</div> <div class="legacy-para">As required by law, every application will go through a rigorous review process at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which includes by law a peer review by independent scientific experts.\xc2\xa0 At the end of the process, we\'ll announce the grant awards early in 2010.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So the demonstrations are about learning what works and what doesn\'t.\xc2\xa0 Grantees will be required to report back to us with data on patient safety and medical liability costs.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier, this isn\'t a new area of interest for the President.\xc2\xa0 He said from the start of the reform process that he\'s open to any idea that will help improve health care quality and patient safety and bring down overall costs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The demonstrations made possible by the grants will help us learn what changes are needed in our health care and medical liability system to help accomplish the goals.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re looking forward to collecting the data, sharing in and acting on part of our ongoing effort to assure that all Americans have access to the best-quality, most affordable health care possible.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary, if this is such a serious problem, as it says in the release, then why just a demonstration project?\xc2\xa0 Why isn\'t this part of the comprehensive health care?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY SEBELIUS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the good news is that the President feels strongly enough about this that he wants us to move ahead right now.\xc2\xa0 He\'s not using this as a lever in the health care debate, but he feels that we can move ahead.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had this authority within the Agency for Health Research and Quality since 1999.\xc2\xa0 Nobody, not the prior administration, not anybody, has ever directed that this agency move ahead, and the President thinks we should do it right now.<br/> <br/>  So we\'re going to move ahead the same way we moved ahead -- we announced yesterday -- we\'re moving ahead on a medical homes model, which is a great experiment taking place in various parts of the country, lowering costs and delivering high-quality care.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the research is already there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY SEBELIUS:\xc2\xa0 The research is not there.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems that the -- you have enough research to know this is a serious problem.\xc2\xa0 Why -- why not work with Congress?\xc2\xa0 It clearly could be beneficial to you guys politically.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something Republicans want to be involved with.\xc2\xa0 It just seems like -- how does somebody not interpret this as saying, well, you know what, trial lawyers are a huge interest group of the Democratic Party, so that\'s why they\'re going slowly?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me step in for one second.\xc2\xa0 I think you can recall from the presidential campaign, I don\'t recall us being the preferred candidate of the trial lawyers that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Second, as the Secretary said --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes you were.\xc2\xa0 You got more money than any other candidate when it came to trial lawyers.<br/>  \xc2\xa0<br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d check your FEC figures on the primary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Check out opensecrets.org.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Happy to do it.\xc2\xa0 I think it came up in some interviews with your network.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The authority has existed since 1999.\xc2\xa0 There are certainly provisions in some of the House bills that would codify some of the Sorry Works! ideas that the President introduced in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But the thing here, Chuck, is we could wait and wait and wait, or the President could, as he did, instruct the Secretary to act in setting these projects and programs up in order to get them going and moving to ensure patient quality and get doctors practicing medicine again, rather than waiting for a political football to get tossed around the aisles of Congress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, how soon do you anticipate things actually changing in the real world, based on the grants, the work done, and the changes, as actual doctors and patients interact and the system begins to adapt to what these demonstration projects reveal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY SEBELIUS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re hoping that the incentives will encourage systems to come together and look at models that are already in place.\xc2\xa0 We know -- you know, the kind of Sorry Works!, the system in the -- that was contemplated in the MEDiC bill is already in place -- the University of Michigan and children\'s hospitals throughout Kentucky that have demonstrated that they can reduce litigation costs, compensate patients in a much more timely fashion, improve communication.\xc2\xa0 So there are some models in place that we hope we\'ll take a look at, and could be put in place very quickly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Lots of states have bits and pieces of the puzzle.\xc2\xa0 There are states with screening panels.\xc2\xa0 There are states that have review processes.\xc2\xa0 There\'s some voluntary mediation efforts.\xc2\xa0 And we think this is an opportunity to not only look at what has had a proven effect lowering preventable errors; increasing patient safety, which is the number-one goal; improving communications; and lowering costs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So we\'ll share that data.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to inform people around the country.\xc2\xa0 There\'s never been a scientific look at what works and what doesn\'t.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been a lot of anecdotal battles, really, for three decades.\xc2\xa0 We think this is a big step forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, some states have passed malpractice reform, obviously.\xc2\xa0 Has HHS looked at what\'s happened in those states and seen if any of them meet these four requirements?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY SEBELIUS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re going to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the review that\'s going to be underway.\xc2\xa0 It\'s never happened before now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you say demonstration projects, you don\'t just mean -- I guess I misunderstand --</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY SEBELIUS:\xc2\xa0 There are two areas where states or medical systems can apply for grants.\xc2\xa0 One is a planning grant that will be up to a year, up to $300,000 to look at what may work in that jurisdiction or within that medical system and put something in place.\xc2\xa0 The other is a demonstration project that could run for up to three years.</div> <div class="legacy-para">At the same time, the Agency for Health Research and Quality is going to be reviewing just exactly what is out there scientifically, what has some evidence that it\'s had an impact on patient safety, on lowering costs, and share that information as we go forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, $25 million is a pretty small amount at first.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you\'ve thought about how it would be expanded if these demonstration projects proved efficacious?\xc2\xa0 And also, how this interacts with the legislation that\'s moving through Capitol Hill in the health care bill, bills, like the House one, that contains a similar program.<br/> <br/>  SECRETARY SEBELIUS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the good news is that this can move forward within the next 60 days, and the grant applications can start coming in immediately.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have the framework up.\xc2\xa0 So this is a faster process than legislation can be because that will take some time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We haven\'t thought at this point about how to expand.\xc2\xa0 We\'re hoping that this becomes an opportunity for -- as I say, medical systems in some jurisdictions hav</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
