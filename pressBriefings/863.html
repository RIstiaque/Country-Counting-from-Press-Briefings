Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:48 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your flexibility.\xc2\xa0 I know we moved the briefing up.\xc2\xa0 And I have no announcements to make at the top, so I will go right to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to start with Syria.\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State Clinton said that the defection of Syria\'s prime minister increases the urgency of preparing for a post-Assad Syria.\xc2\xa0 What type of role should the U.S. have in those plans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you, first of all, to Secretary of State Clinton\'s comments.\xc2\xa0 But it is certainly the case that contingency planning is the responsible thing to do.\xc2\xa0 I think we discussed a little bit of that here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And we are, of course, actively consulting with friends, allies, and the opposition about a post-Assad Syria.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to get into the specifics of our contingency plans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Secretary Clinton said earlier today, we can\'t possibly predict a timeline at this point, but we know the transition will happen.\xc2\xa0 We know that Assad ultimately will not be a part of Syria\'s future.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can say that in this transition we think it\'s essential to make sure that state\'s institutions stay intact and that we send very clear expectations about avoiding sectarian warfare.\xc2\xa0 We have to think about what we can do to support a Syrian-led democratic transition that protects the rights of all Syrians.\xc2\xa0 We have to figure out how to support the return of security and public safety, and how to get the Syrian economy up and going.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our allies, we\'re working with the "Friends of Syria" and we\'re working directly with the opposition in our efforts to plan for that eventuality and to help the Syrians make that transition in a way that gives them the best possible prospects for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate an increased aid package in the coming weeks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t get into specifics, as I said before, and I think it\'s premature, because we can\'t predict a timeline, to say what we will do when that happens except to say that we will be actively engaged in helping the Syrian people, together with a broad array of nations who have the interests of the Syrian people at heart.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, this transition -- this day will come once Assad steps aside.\xc2\xa0 And it is essential that it does come because the longer Assad remains in power, the longer that he has the support of the Iranians, for example, or others, the more bloodshed, the more chaos there is in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic, the Romney campaign is out with a new ad accusing the President of gutting welfare reform, essentially saying that the administration has turned into a blank check for states without any work requirements.\xc2\xa0 From a policy standpoint, does the White House feel that offering these states this flexibility has somehow undermined the work requirement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From a policy standpoint, let me say that this advertisement is categorically false and it is blatantly dishonest.\xc2\xa0 This administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy will strengthen the program by giving states the opportunity to employ more effective ways to help people get off welfare and into a job.\xc2\xa0 Under this policy, governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people -- more people -- from welfare to work.\xc2\xa0 And as we have made very clear under our policy, any request from any state that undercuts the work requirement in welfare reform will be rejected.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the ad is particularly outrageous as Governor Romney himself, with 28 other Republican governors, supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever.\xc2\xa0 Those are not standards the President supports.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also worth remembering that this waiver policy that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing was specifically requested by two Republican governors -- Governor Herbert of Utah and Governor Sandoval of Nevada -- two men, I think you know, who are supporters of Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think if you ask them -- and I suggest you do -- that they believe that their interest in these waivers was guided by a desire to undermine work requirements.\xc2\xa0 Their interest in these waivers was to achieve more flexibility for their states, to innovate and to move more people from work to welfare [welfare to work].\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of this policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tReuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The British bank Standard Chartered is in hot water with New York financial authorities for allegedly hiding $250 billion in transactions tied to Iran.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if this was an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s reached the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk and if the White House has been in touch with British authorities on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports, but I do not have specific comment on what is an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 Of course, as you know, sanctions violations are something that this administration takes extremely seriously and has a strong record of action to this end.\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Department remains in close contact with both federal and state authorities on this matter, and I would refer you over there for further questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xc2\xa0 Julianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The stock market seems to be rallying today, in part on some positive developments out of Europe.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House share that optimism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julianna, our view of the situation in Europe remains what it has been, which is that the difficulties Europe faces are not going to be solved overnight.\xc2\xa0 But we are working with European leaders, both at the presidential level -- I think yesterday I read out a -- or we read out a phone call the President had with the Spanish Prime Minister -- and at the level of the Treasury Secretary, to assist them and advise them as they seek to take, in their words, whatever steps are necessary to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we believe is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that officials move quickly to make good on leaders\xe2\x80\x99 commitments from the late-June summit in order to reduce immediate financial market stresses, even as they undertake longer-term reform and integration plans to promote growth adjustment and stability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is all important to us because what happens in Europe affects our economy.\xc2\xa0 Europe, as you know, is our largest economic partner and we are closely linked in many ways, and we have a profound interest in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s stability and growth.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, the President has noted, that instability in the eurozone creates a headwind for the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 So it is very much in our interests to see European leaders take the steps that they said they would take to deal with the situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 German Chancellor Angela Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s announcement yesterday that she\xe2\x80\x99s accepting the bond-buying program, does that send any more optimism to think -- the White House, the President think that Europe is on track to meet --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without critiquing individual statements or steps, because this is obviously something that European leaders are doing themselves, I would simply say that we encourage European leaders to, in effect, operationalize the commitments at the late-June summit.\xc2\xa0 And steps that demonstrate an effort to do that I think are welcome here and across the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn, how are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fine, thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Back to welfare -- it is not just a campaign commercial.\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney, minutes ago in Illinois, stated the same thing -- that the President wants to take the work requirement out of welfare.\xc2\xa0 You called the ad categorically false and blatantly dishonest.\xc2\xa0 Is Governor Romney being dishonest about what he should know the truth is on welfare reform?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s his ad, and so as a matter of policy -- and my response to this utter misrepresentation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy -- the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 The attack is dishonest.\xc2\xa0 It is false.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, again, this policy arose and was specifically requested by two Republican governors -- Republican governors who, I believe if you asked them, would not say that they sought or are seeking to undermine the work requirement in welfare reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, because it seems to be the case these days that -- with charges like this, that hypocrisy knows no bounds, Governor Romney joined with 28 other Republican governors in support of policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever.\xc2\xa0 So perhaps his argument is with his past self.\xc2\xa0 And I suppose that should not be a surprise.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But President Obama, last night, talked about "Romney Hood" and Governor Romney wanting to take money from the middle class and apply that tax money to the upper class.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans say there is nothing in Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s economic plan that raises taxes on the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President guilty of the same kind of stretching the truth?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not, because as independent analysts have said, as the Tax Policy Center documented last week, Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s promise of a $5 trillion tax cut that is, as promised, revenue-neutral is a mathematical fantasy.\xc2\xa0 It cannot happen.\xc2\xa0 It simply will not work.\xc2\xa0 It is understandable, I suppose, in the heat of a primary battle that you would make fantastical promises about what you might do in policy.\xc2\xa0 But the problem is at some point someone is going to analyze your proposals and make the obvious judgment that it cannot happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no way to give that kind of tax relief without, A, blowing a hole in the deficit; B, asking middle-class Americans to pay a tax hike, to pay more; or, C, radically savaging Social Security or Medicare.\xc2\xa0 It simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up.\xc2\xa0 There is no mathematical way to make it happen.\xc2\xa0 And assertions that it can happen without any kind of documentation to prove otherwise should be taken for what they\xe2\x80\x99re worth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis goes -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon the referees here to say -- to not cover this stuff simply as a campaign tactic, but to assess fact from fiction.\xc2\xa0 Look at the policies of this President when it comes to welfare reform.\xc2\xa0 Look at the specific proposals for allowing states that request it more flexibility to implement welfare reform, provided that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s fact from tactic.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, on the tax policy, it is simply a fact that you can\xe2\x80\x99t cut taxes by $5 trillion, promise that it won\xe2\x80\x99t add a dime to the deficit, that it will be revenue-neutral, without doing one of two things:\xc2\xa0 raising taxes on the middle class, or savaging Social Security and Medicare.\xc2\xa0 The money is just not there.\xc2\xa0 Or savaging defense, which Governor Romney claims he actually wants to increase spending on.\xc2\xa0 So at some point, it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon those who would govern or legislate to demonstrate how their policies are more than flimsy sheets of paper.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President entertain a head-to-head debate sometime earlier than October on something like this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there is a schedule of debates set for -- set by the Presidential Commission on Debates.\xc2\xa0 The President looks very much forward to debating policy and his vision for America\xe2\x80\x99s future, which is very focused on this whole question of how do we keep the economy growing, how do we keep it creating jobs, how do we make it grow faster and create more jobs, and what policies will work to get us there.\xc2\xa0 And we have some recent history by which to judge the different policy proposals that are on the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President believes -- not as a matter of wishful thinking, but as a matter of concrete fact -- that his policies of taking a balanced approach to our fiscal challenges, to deficit reduction, of making sure we continue to invest in education and innovation and infrastructure, research and development, are the right ones; that his policies of extending tax relief to the middle class while asking the wealthiest 2 percent of American taxpayers to pay a little more are the right ones; and that the policies that we tried in the eight years prior to President Obama taking office empirically, demonstrably, provably, did not work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause, after all, when we all assembled here in January of 2009, those of you who were covering the administration from the beginning -- and I working across the street for the Vice President -- remember what those headlines were like -- economic calamity like none of us had seen in our lifetimes, job loss like none of us had seen in our lifetimes, like this country had not seen since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 That was the legacy of the very policies that are being put forward for a repeat performance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President feels very strongly that they are the wrong policies.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to the debate about which way to go forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tBriana.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Priorities super PAC has an ad out today that features a man who used to work at a steel plant that closed in 2001.\xc2\xa0 This was after it was acquired by Bain Capital.\xc2\xa0 And the implication is that Mitt Romney bears responsibility for the death of this man\'s wife because he lost his insurance when the plant closed in 2001 and then, in 2006, his wife who was uninsured at the time, died of cancer.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the President believes that Mitt Romney shares responsibility in her death.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the ad, and I would refer you to the campaign or to the organization.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t comment on that when I haven\'t seen it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you just took a very vocal position on an ad from a conservative super PAC.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 An ad that falsely and dishonestly represents the President\'s current policy.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen this.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t respond to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you look at it and then let me know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I would refer you to the President\'s reelection campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you see it and you\'re responding to ads by a conservative super PAC, couldn\'t you respond to one about the super PAC --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 By all means, ask me tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I said, I\'m simply saying that I have not seen this, so how could I possibly assess it without seeing it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can -- will you assess it later?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you ask me tomorrow, sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s been a lot of talk over the past 24 hours about the fact that Mr. Romney has outraised President Obama for the third month in a row.\xc2\xa0 Before that, the President was outraising Mr. Romney.\xc2\xa0 But at the end of the day, if both of these candidates and their supporters raise a billion dollars or $1.2 billion, does it really matter who raises more?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that qualifies as a question beyond my purview here that I would refer to the campaigns and to political professionals on the outside about how much money is involved in a presidential election cycle.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, one thing we certainly know -- and this goes to policy, because of the President\'s position on Citizens United -- is that untold millions, hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent by outside groups disproportionately attacking the President.\xc2\xa0 Much of that money will be spent by organizations that do not reveal to the public who their supporters are, who their donors are.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously thinks that is an unfortunate result, but a predictable result, of the Citizens United decision.\xc2\xa0 But assessments for how the money factor plays into the presidential election, I would refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point, the President has had to attend so many more fundraisers than, say, George W. Bush had during this point in his reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 Does that impact the President\'s ability to do his day job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it does not.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is part of running for President and running for reelection.\xc2\xa0 But as we\'ve discussed here, it is a simple reality that even as he is a candidate for reelection, he continues to be President of the United States, and the demands of the job restrict his capacity in some instances to focus entirely on the campaign.\xc2\xa0 He simply cannot do that.\xc2\xa0 So he and we carefully allocate his time working with the campaign.\xc2\xa0 And when matters of state trump campaign requests for his time, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that he has to live with and we have to live with because that is his primary responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tWendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President of the Boston Fed is suggesting the Fed should again act because the economy is just treading water.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to Republican criticism that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s actions, and not the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies, that are keeping the economy from going under?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those assessments, but I would simply say, Wendell, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on the Fed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to comment on the Fed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to comment on comments about the Fed.\xc2\xa0 I would --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to comment on people who weigh the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s actions against the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies in line with the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, am I surprised that Republicans are criticizing the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies, I am not.\xc2\xa0 I am happy to access the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies and point you to this simple fact -- that when the President took office, we were in a cascading economic crisis, the likes of which none of us had seen in our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President took dramatic action -- sometimes, as with the auto bailout, action that was deemed politically unwise and unpopular, but was the right thing to do. He took action working with Congress to pass and implement and sign the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 And his policies, once they began to take effect, have helped this economy reverse the course it was on when he took office, which was one of -- at the time, seemed like bottomless decline\xc2\xa0 -- and put us in a situation where, while we are far from where we need to be, we have been growing economically since the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies have taken effect and we have been creating -- this economy has been creating private sector jobs, 4.5 million of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat stands in stark contrast to the situation that existed when the President took office.\xc2\xa0 And as I noted, it is instructive to look back at the result of the policies that are now being put forward as an antidote or the answer to our problems and see what they bequeathed to us in 2007 and 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say it\xe2\x80\x99s a combination of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on the Fed and its actions, its impact on the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s simply something I do not do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s comment about "Romney Hood" -- was that an ad-lib or was that in his prepared remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s speeches --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were pleased with it, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xc2\xa0 And it got a predictable response from Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s point is a point that he\'s been making quite frequently of late, which is that policies that promise massive tax cuts, that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest of us, are not the right prescription for the economy and they are simply bad for the middle class, because as the Tax Policy Center made clear in its study last week -- a study which, by the way, reporters who wrote about it said, bent over backwards to be generous to Governor Romney\'s policy proposals -- simply cannot work without resulting in a tax hike for the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I said earlier, the numbers don\'t add up.\xc2\xa0 The math is a fantasy.\xc2\xa0 And we are in a reality-based universe here when we talk about economic policy.\xc2\xa0 The economic crisis, the Great Recession that was in full bloom when President Obama took office was a real tangible consequence of policy decisions that ended up being wrong for America.\xc2\xa0 And the President took bold action, some of it at the time unpopular, to halt the economic decline that this country was experiencing, and to reverse it.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the hole dug by the Great Recession is very deep, and we continue to climb out of it together as a country.\xc2\xa0 But one thing is quite clear, and that is that we cannot go back, that we should not buy any more magic potion that promises to cure the economy\'s ills by giving tax cuts to the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 We know that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to relieve me with a little foreign policy, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh!</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A little counter-programming.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Earlier this week, the President made a phone call to the women\'s gymnastics team.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was with him.\xc2\xa0 He was very excited.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay -- and said, "Michelle and I have watched and decided, of all the Olympians, you guys amaze us the most."\xc2\xa0 I wonder if he wants to revisit those after the awesomeness of the U.S. women\'s soccer team coming back -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to say that time stopped -- I don\'t know where everybody here was -- but in upper press and lower press, it was -- and I think across the West Wing -- that last half hour of that game was just extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\'t spoken about this yet with the President, but I know that he was extremely excited by the victory and looks forward to the final.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, I think -- look, the President\'s comments about the women\'s gymnastics simply reflected his, as you\'ve heard him say, he knows how to swim, he just can\'t swim as fast as our Olympians, and he knows how to run, he simply can\'t run as fast as our Olympians.\xc2\xa0 But it amazes him that those young women can do what they do on the balance beam and the parallel bars and the vault.\xc2\xa0 It\'s really quite extraordinary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe spoke with the members of the women\'s gymnastics team after they had won the team competition.\xc2\xa0 And I know he was very excited to see Gabby Douglas win the individual competition.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s been a great Olympics so far, I think we can all agree.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have a comment at all about Mrs. Romney\'s horse not making the semis?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had a discussion with him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- I know you\'re really playing against type here, Scott.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I appreciate the diversion.\xc2\xa0 I have not had that discussion with him.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I can tell you the President was strongly behind every American athlete and entrant into the Olympics and wanted all of them to succeed.</p>\n<p>\n\tChuck.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You used some rough language -- "hypocrisy knows no bound", "blatantly dishonest", "categorically false" -- to talk about this ad from the Romney campaign.\xc2\xa0 And, yesterday, when asked about what Harry Reid is doing, you basically said, well, you guys know Harry Reid, he can speak for himself.\xc2\xa0 So what Harry Reid is doing is appropriate and what Mitt Romney is doing is inappropriate?\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I speak for the President.\xc2\xa0 This ad --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say about the ad -- what about Harry -- what does Harry -- is what Harry Reid doing appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 I explain and defend the President\'s policies.\xc2\xa0 This advertisement falsely and dishonestly represents the President\'s policy.\xc2\xa0 And so I very clearly made our views on that known in my response to questions about it.\xc2\xa0 I do not speak for Harry Reid.\xc2\xa0 He is fully capable, as you know well, and others who have covered him know well, of speaking for himself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would simply say that it is certainly a fact that -- I mean, let me back up here.\xc2\xa0 When we talk about ads like this and we talk about other ads that have been aired in this campaign, I understand there\'s an eagerness to cover this as tactic, as will it work, will it be effective -- even if it\'s blatantly false.\xc2\xa0 And I urge my former colleagues to also cover -- I understand there\'s interest in who wins and what tactics are effective -- but to also assess things and to separate fact from fiction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\'re denouncing what Harry Reid is doing, because you don\'t like these -- you don\'t like these tactics.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- I\'m denouncing ads that categorically --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why is the Harry Reid tactic okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, what I\'m saying is we can point you to the President\'s policies and demonstrate that the ad is false.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- again, I don\'t speak for Harry Reid.\xc2\xa0 But there is a way to resolve this dispute, right, which is for the Governor --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there\'s a responsible way to go about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s for the Governor to follow a tradition that was established by his own father many years ago of presidential candidates releasing multiple years of their tax return.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I would -- I think the dispute here is between the Romney campaign and Harry Reid.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Reid doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take direction.\xc2\xa0 He speaks for himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you could say, hey, you know what, this is the low road.\xc2\xa0 The President has been in an ad saying sometimes our politics are small.\xc2\xa0 Is this an example of one of the small --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, the President believes that the broader issue of tax fairness is very important to this campaign.\xc2\xa0 The particular issue of a presidential candidate\'s willingness to be transparent about his or her background is important.\xc2\xa0 And as a matter of tradition, it dates back to 1968, as you know, or the \'68 election actually, prior to \'68.\xc2\xa0 And I speak to his positions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the campaign tit-for-tat, at the purely political level, I refer you to the campaigns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I go back -- and you\'ve been very hesitant, very tough when there have been unsubstantiated allegations that come about the President from people, whether it\'s a Donald Trump or somebody like that.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve called on Republicans to speak out against this.\xc2\xa0 Why is this -- explain to me why this is different, what Harry Reid is doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really can\'t do anything but reiterate what I said both yesterday and today, which is, I speak for the President.\xc2\xa0 I explain and defend his policies.\xc2\xa0 And I am very clear, crystal clear, when I believe that his policies have been falsely represented, as is the case here or when his words have been completely mischaracterized.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You stand by what Harry Reid is doing?\xc2\xa0 Do you think this is a good thing to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to Senator Reid.\xc2\xa0 I think that the issue could be resolved now if a tradition that\'s been in place since 1968 were honored.\xc2\xa0 I understand, as I\'ve said before -- and everybody who has covered presidential candidates knows this and everybody who has worked on campaigns I\'m sure knows this -- that the process of running for President, if you\'re a serious candidate, a major candidate, is not always pleasant and it involves a lot of revelation about one\'s past and the positions you\'ve taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is part of the process, as I said yesterday, that isn\'t always comfortable, that isn\'t what I think candidates leap up and volunteer to do -- here, look at all of my financial records.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s a tradition that as Governor Romney, Governor George Romney said back in the 1968 cycle is important to get a sense of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re comfortable with what Harry Reid is doing?\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not making a judgment on it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m simply saying that this whole thing could be resolved in a minute.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about guns.\xc2\xa0 You were very careful yesterday on the Sikh shooting and on Aurora, basically saying that it\'s too early to talk about policy.\xc2\xa0 When is it appropriate to talk about policy?\xc2\xa0 When does -- does the President believe we have a gun problem in this country, that access to guns is too easy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes we have a violence challenge in this country, a violence problem that we need to address and come at from a variety of fronts, because it is not a problem that is just related to gun laws.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that when it comes to firearms, that we need to take common-sense measures that respect and uphold the Second Amendment rights of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there enough measures on the books?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was asked about the assault-weapons ban, which the President supports reinstating.\xc2\xa0 So I think, in that regard, he believes that Congress has not, but should, take action on that.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, he thinks that we are -- that we can, recognizing a stalemate in Congress, recognizing the difficulty of moving forward even with something like that, that there are measures he can take, directing his administration, his Department of Justice, to make it harder for those who should not have weapons under existing law from obtaining them by improving and enhancing our background check system, on which progress has already been made, and by directing, as he has since he took office, his administration to work with local communities, local law enforcement, to address violence from a variety of angles, including through education and other means.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the point the President was trying to make in New Orleans, and did make, and that I\xe2\x80\x99ve reiterated from here, is that these horrific incidents, like we saw in Aurora and like we saw outside of Milwaukee, are terrible, but we should not forget that violence occurs in America too frequently all the time.\xc2\xa0 And it is a problem that needs to be addressed on multiple fronts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just follow please?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, Sikhs are being -- demonstrating throughout India against violence and gun laws in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And also, at the same time, on Sunday night they gathered outside the White House for a vigil prayer and also thanking the President for his concern.\xc2\xa0 Now, question is that they\xe2\x80\x99re also frightened and scared throughout the gurdwaras in the U.S. and also getting support from India.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re asking the President what message he has for them for the future to put up protection because they are part of this society and President has place in their hearts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can say that the President feels very strongly that in the wake of this shooting that we need to recognize the significant contributions of the Sikh community to the broader American community.\xc2\xa0 I cannot, as I said yesterday, comment on an ongoing investigation or on the motives behind the attack in Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI did note yesterday that since 9/11 there have been occasions where Sikhs have been targeted for violence because they have been misidentified as Muslims.\xc2\xa0 And that is a terrible thing on two levels because obviously neither Muslims nor Sikhs should be targeted for this kind of terrible violence.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\'m speaking in a broader sense here, not with regard to what happened in Wisconsin, because I cannot make judgments about motive there while it\'s under investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as he said in his statement, the President and the First Lady -- their hearts go out to the victims, to their families, to the broader community.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the FBI is part of this investigation and, more broadly, the administration is certainly assisting in whatever way it can.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, I see American flag is half-staff or lowered, and is that in connection with the victims in Oak Creek?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, is President going to make a phone call to Prime Minister of India, or going to visit the victims?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no calls or scheduling announcements, or schedule changes to announce to you at this time.\xc2\xa0 But the answer is yes with regards to the flags being lowered.</p>\n<p>\n\tDonovan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have a question -- there\'s a report out today, I think it\'s on the Drudge Report, that the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Be mindful of your sources.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking the question.\xc2\xa0 That the President told someone he believes Mitt Romney wants to pick General Petraeus as a running mate.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say with absolute confidence that such an assertion has never been uttered by the President.\xc2\xa0 And again, be mindful of your sources.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Drudge is wrong?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Apparently so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would Petraeus make a good Vice President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 General Petraeus was an excellent general and is currently serving very well at the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In these waning months, weeks, leading into November, how important are the polls?\xc2\xa0 I know you say you don\'t look at the polls, but we know for sure --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve never said that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know for sure that the Democratic Party and this White House are looking at the polls throughout the country, how Democrats are faring and what people are thinking.\xc2\xa0 How important are the poll numbers to you at this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that sounds like a question that would be best directed to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say, speaking for the President, that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then answer a campaign question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- that he has said all along that he believes this will be a close election.\xc2\xa0 And the President has said that and others have said that, speaking for him and his campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President fully understands that this country is continuing to emerge from the Great Recession, that Americans continue to be concerned about the direction of the economy, the need to have the economy grow more, to have it create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is so focused on the security, the economic security of the middle class, because he believes that that is, as he said back when he ran for office the first time, for this office in 2008, that the security of the middle class is elemental to his vision of America\'s economic future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd long before the Great Recession delivered a hammer blow, to use a recently used phrase, to the middle class, the middle class was suffering already.\xc2\xa0 It was being squeezed by economic policies that disproportionately rewarded the wealthiest of Americans but did not, as promised, deliver the kind of economic growth or job creation that we, the American people, had been told they would.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s why we cannot go back to those policies, and that\'s why this President is focused with such determination on an agenda that expands opportunity for the middle class, expands security for the middle class, that takes a balanced approach to our fiscal challenges, that ensures that we are continuing to invest in education and innovation and research and development, so that our economy has the foundation to grow in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are the issues that preoccupy the President, and they are certainly the issues that will be debated in this election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I talked to David Axelrod last week, and he -- I brought up the question about some Republicans are saying that there will be -- Mitt Romney will receive 40 percent of the vote in November at least.\xc2\xa0 And he said it would be tighter than that.\xc2\xa0 And he even likened it possibly to Gore v. Bush.\xc2\xa0 What do you say about that from the tightness?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to predict outcomes.\xc2\xa0 The President has the economic vision that he believes and I believe and we all believe are the -- is the right one for this country\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 We need to move forward and not backward.\xc2\xa0 The election in the end takes place on a single day when Americans across the country cast their ballots.\xc2\xa0 I know that some of them will have cast their ballots ahead of time because of early voting, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll know the outcome when we know the outcome.\xc2\xa0 This President right now is focused on the possibilities that -- you like that quote there, Chuck?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is what it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is it what it is.\xc2\xa0 But seriously, from now until then, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the President focus on his responsibilities in office and on making the case about why his vision is the right one for our future economically, and why his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s proposals are mirror images -- although slightly exaggerated in size and form -- of the very policies that contributed to the worst economic disaster of our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter Baker.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You left out \xe2\x80\x9cone day at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One day at a time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could I ask a question on early voters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I called on Peter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney has promised 12 million jobs in the next four years if he is elected.\xc2\xa0 Is that a realistic goal?\xc2\xa0 Is there a goal that the President has by number for how many jobs he would --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things about that -- that a single piece of paper or a couple pieces of paper upon which you base a representation like that I think should be judged accordingly.\xc2\xa0 I would also note that projections by outside economists as well as the CBO suggest a certain amount of economic growth and job creation over those years.\xc2\xa0 But I would -- let me go back to the first point because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s most important.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is not enough to simply make promises about what your economic policies deliver -- will deliver, and then not expect the policy specifics to be analyzed and judged for what, realistically, they can deliver.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what we saw.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Tax Policy Center\xe2\x80\x99s assessment was so valuable, because it simply -- to quote I think one of the articles I read, the analysts there \xe2\x80\x9cbent over backwards\xe2\x80\x9d to be as generous as possible to Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s plan, to insert all the assumptions that would be most generous to it, and yet still came to the irrefutable conclusion that you cannot have a tax policy like the one that has been proposed without -- that does not result in the wealthiest Americans getting huge tax cuts and middle-class Americans seeing their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt just can\xe2\x80\x99t happen, because you have to -- in order to give that huge tax break to millionaires -- I mean, what is it, $250,000 -- another $250,000 to someone who makes $3 million without then asking dozens and dozens of middle-class families to pay the bill for that tax cut.\xc2\xa0 So the money that\xe2\x80\x99s being asked for here, the price -- when the plan says, you, middle-class America, has to pay more -- you have to pay more to pay for this proposal, it\xe2\x80\x99s not, well, you need to pay more because we all need to contribute to bringing the deficit down.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not you need to pay more to pay for our national defense or for education or for Social Security and Medicare.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s you need to pay more, on average, for a middle-class family, $2,200 more, so that a millionaire or multi-millionaire can get a massive tax break.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s not our assessment.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the assessment of an independent outfit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You segued nicely from my question to your answer.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if we could go back to the jobs question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it realistic to expect 12 million jobs --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t assessed it.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I would encourage you and others to take that promise and bring it to outside economists and see what they say.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment of it.\xc2\xa0 What I know is that the economic policies that have been put forward will result in massive tax breaks for millionaires and substantial tax hikes on middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the right policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President give us his sense of what he expects us to see in four years before the campaign is over?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been very clear about what his economic policies are, what he believes we need to do, not just in the four years going forward.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he would encourage Congress to take this issue away from him, the middle-class tax cut, by coming back now during recess or immediately upon their return in September, and reaching an agreement.\xc2\xa0 Because if you look at what the Senate passed, the bill the President supported, and the tax cuts it extended for 98 percent of the American people, and you look at what the House passed, which was that same 98 percent, but tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers, the overlap is pretty substantial -- 98 percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s make that law.\xc2\xa0 Sign it into law and take that issue away.\xc2\xa0 Give the middle class the certainty that would be created by that.\xc2\xa0 Give the economy the boost that would be delivered by that.\xc2\xa0 And then, continue to debate whether or not the wealthiest 2 percent should be getting another substantial tax cut next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask just maybe -- the President always says or likes to say we\xe2\x80\x99ve created 4.5 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 Given his fascination with that number, can we get any expectation from him of what he thinks we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to create in the next four years?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- well, let me just say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a prediction for you of future economic growth.\xc2\xa0 We have economists here who put forward policy proposals and assessments of the future.\xc2\xa0 You can also look at CBO and other analysts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President does is focus on his policy proposals.\xc2\xa0 And what you saw with the American Jobs Act is that rather than make predictions of -- like you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing from Governor Romney of \xe2\x80\x98my one-sheet plan here will create 12 million jobs\xe2\x80\x99 -- the President put forward a comprehensive job creation proposal, legislation that went before Congress, and we made no assessments of how many jobs it would create.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we let outside analysts, outside economists assess it, and they made a judgment that the portions of the American Jobs Act that Congress has yet to pass would add an addition 1 million-plus jobs to the American economy right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Congress should pass that.\xc2\xa0 Put teachers back to work, firefighters and police officers back to work, construction workers back on the job.\xc2\xa0 That would certainly help those families.\xc2\xa0 It would help the economy overall.\xc2\xa0 And it would help build infrastructure in this country that would allow the American economy to continue to grow.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon-Christopher.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be holding a full-blown press conference anytime soon, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Define \xe2\x80\x9canytime soon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before November.\xc2\xa0 Before his vacation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will be holding -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will be taking questions from you in the relatively near future.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Collinson.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You said that it was important that the institutions of the state to be maintained in Syria after the fall of Assad.\xc2\xa0 How much of this approach is informed by what happened in Iraq when the Ba\xe2\x80\x99athist state institutions were torn up after the fall of Saddam Hussein?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that that precedent is useful to look at.\xc2\xa0 There are other precedents to look at, and the experience that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had and that the region has had in various countries that have been affected by the Arab Spring.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is also true, as I have said or tried to say frequently, that each country in the region is different.\xc2\xa0 And so I would not suggest that any other country\xe2\x80\x99s past experience is identical to what we can expect or what we could expect in Syria if various decisions were made about the transition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, with our partners, what needs to happen in Syria in a post-Assad world there that\xe2\x80\x99s best for the Syrians; that allows for, as you mentioned and I mentioned, the state institutions to stay intact; that allows for a transition that brings about a government that is inclusive, that is responsive to the Syrian people, and that acknowledges and enforces the liberties and rights of all Syrians.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think King Abdullah said that -- in CBS News today -- that he was worried that Assad -- if Damascus fell, Assad might retreat to an Alawite enclave, and that could lead to the kind of breakup of Syria and ethnic conflict.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House is concerned about, too?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, the longer this goes on, the longer Assad remains in power, the longer he is helped in his efforts to remain in power by those who continue to prop him up, the more chaotic the situation becomes in Syria, the more violence, the more bloodshed.\xc2\xa0 And those are all bad things.\xc2\xa0 That is why it is so essential that Assad step aside and that the Syrian people be given the opportunity to determine their own future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are all sorts of possible outcomes in Syria that are less than ideal.\xc2\xa0 The least ideal, the worst outcome is one that would somehow allow Assad to stay in power and to continue to butcher his own people.\xc2\xa0 That will not happen.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people won\xe2\x80\x99t allow it to happen.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent days and weeks, Assad\xe2\x80\x99s grip on power continues to loosen.\xc2\xa0 His control over his government, of his military, of the country continues to lessen.\xc2\xa0 But there is no question that suffering continues as well due to his actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, last one.\xc2\xa0 Connie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the chemical weapons -- do you have an update on where they are?\xc2\xa0 And could these be the weapons that were looked for and never found in Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that suggestion posited.\xc2\xa0 I would simple say, as I have in the past, that we remain concerned about the stockpiles of chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We have and our international partners have made clear that it is the responsibility of the Syrian government to safeguard those stockpiles, and that any -- that the government and individuals within it will be held accountable if those stockpiles are not safeguarded.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that cross-border raid between Israel and Egypt, was there al Qaeda behind it as far as you can assess?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment of that.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps the State Department can help you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is Friday the relatively near future?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no scheduling announcements to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:36 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
