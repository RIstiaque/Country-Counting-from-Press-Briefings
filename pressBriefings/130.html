EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So I had the opportunity to sit in on the first part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s roundtable discussion with some of the Muslim leaders that the President was meeting with prior to his speech today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was an opportunity for him, as you saw, to visit with Muslims from all walks of life, with a variety of experiences. \xc2\xa0But all of them do reflect the diversity of our country, certainly the racial and ethnic diversity of our country. \xc2\xa0But they all have their own story to tell about the way that they contribute to and enrich the communities in which they live. \xc2\xa0So the President will certainly enjoy the opportunity to hear from them. \xc2\xa0That discussion is ongoing, but I wanted to step out and have a chance to speak with all of you before the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask about the Zika virus?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The WHO has said it\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about a potential new way it\xe2\x80\x99s transmitted. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether this changes anything for the United States and its response and its strategy. \xc2\xa0The Dallas case I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say over the last couple of weeks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this, there is still a lot of scientific work that needs to be done to understand a lot about this disease, including its connection to a particular birth defect, but also how it\xe2\x80\x99s transmitted. \xc2\xa0At this point, our understanding of exactly the impact of the disease, though, has not changed. \xc2\xa0The symptoms that are associated with this virus are relatively mild, and they last only a week or so. \xc2\xa0And they only appear in about one in five people who contracts the virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe particular concern that we have is about the potential link to a birth defect. \xc2\xa0In the case that you mention, in Texas, that does not appear to be an issue. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to rely on the collection of data and the analysis of our scientific experts to guide the American public and provide them with the information that they need to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should Americans be more worried about potentially contracting it, particularly women who may be considering having a child, given that there\xe2\x80\x99s this potential new route of transmission?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, as we have more information about what people can do to protect themselves, then we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to share that information. \xc2\xa0But as you point out, it is important for people to understand exactly what those risks are. \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re a man, the risks are relatively minimal. \xc2\xa0The risks are associated with contracting a virus that has relatively mild symptoms. \xc2\xa0But we do want to communicate with the American public. \xc2\xa0And as we have more information to share about the steps that they can take to keep them and their families safe, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll share that information.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I wanted to ask about Libya. \xc2\xa0The Secretary of State seems to have indicated that the President has ruled out any participation in a U.N. ground force in Libya should the national unity government be established. \xc2\xa0I was wondering, has the President actually ruled that out? \xc2\xa0I understand they haven\'t received any recommendation as yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President did convene his National Security Council a week or two ago to talk about our counter-ISIL efforts. \xc2\xa0This is something that he does every couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0And the focus of those discussions is typically on the ongoing efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the desire on the part of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to try to establish a foothold in other countries that are experiencing severe political chaos like they are in Libya. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a number of things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to try to counter that. \xc2\xa0The first is, we have been working hard to support the U.N.-led effort to bring about the kind of political transition inside of Libya that will allow a national unity government to be established and to stabilize the political situation in that country. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s our top priority. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult challenge and one that\xe2\x80\x99s been ongoing for some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has not hesitated to order the use of military force, even in Libya, to protect the American people and to counter ISIL. \xc2\xa0In fact, back in November, the United States military carried out an airstrike where the leading ISIL figure in Libya was taken off the battlefield. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we move forward, the President will continue to be updated on the potential risks associated with the spread of ISIL into Libya, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to get updates from his team about what they recommend is the best way to counter that threat. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new announcements to make about decisions the President has or hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made. \xc2\xa0But I think the track record of just the last couple of months I think gives you the opportunity to assess that the President has demonstrated a willingness to take decisive action to protect the American people from ISIL, even in Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think if the national unity government is stood up, which it looks like it will be, is it possible for them to survive without foreign military assistance on the ground and boots on the ground?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the first thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do is, as the national unity government is put together, we certainly are going to be very respectful of the sovereignty of that government. \xc2\xa0So that will be the first thing. \xc2\xa0I think that the national unity government, to the extent that they request the assistance and support of the United States and other Western governments, they can count on it. \xc2\xa0We understand that the stability and even success of the national unity government in Libya has national security consequences for the United States and our allies, because we know that ISIL is looking to capitalize on countries that governed by unstable governments. \xc2\xa0And so the more that we can bolster the capacity of the national unity government in Libya to govern that country, the better off we\'re going to be.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m confident that part of that support will include cooperation on a range of national security issues. \xc2\xa0What form that kind of support or assistance will take at this point is too early to say. \xc2\xa0But if there is a need -- again, as we demonstrated back in November, if there is a need for the United States to take unilateral action to protect the American people, the President won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can I ask you about the visit here today? \xc2\xa0There has been criticism in a variety of outlets about this particular mosque and its potential ties to extremist groups. \xc2\xa0Given that focus, does the White House still feel good about the vetting process of selecting this particular mosque to visit? \xc2\xa0Are there any questions about how this particular site was chosen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know that there has been some criticism. \xc2\xa0But I think you all have had the chance to spend a little time here, just in the last few minutes. \xc2\xa0I think you can see that there is -- that this is an institution that is making a valuable contribution to its community. \xc2\xa0There is a school here that\'s educating children. \xc2\xa0There are medical services provided in this facility. \xc2\xa0And this is a faith community that regularly speaks out against extremism. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the President is here to do today is to affirm the rightful role that the people who worship at this mosque have in our country, and that our commitment to protecting their religious liberty is quite firm.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President can make a pretty powerful statement to that effect just by showing up. \xc2\xa0But he also brought along a speech where he intends to communicate that not just to those who are in the room, but to those who will be watching his remarks around the country and even around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you don\'t have concerns that the message he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to deliver gets overshadowed by this pulled focus of these criticisms and concerns that are being raised?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0There is no one who has been covering politics over the last year who is surprised to see that the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to a mosque is going to be criticized by the President\xe2\x80\x99s political opponents. \xc2\xa0We\'re not concerned about that at all. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf anything, if it elevates the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit and elevates the President\xe2\x80\x99s message of protecting religious liberty and affirming the rightful and meaningful contribution of Muslim Americans to our country, then our opponents should be keep it up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should he have come earlier considering rising levels of anti-Muslim rhetoric in this country and rising anti-Muslim hate crimes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the timing of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit is good. \xc2\xa0And it does serve as an opportunity for him to send a meaningful message to both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you describe the process by which the roundtable participants were chosen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What we sought to do is to bring together a diversity of voices, people with a variety of perspectives, different racial and ethnic backgrounds, and even people who practice their Muslim faith in different ways. \xc2\xa0All of them know what they have in common is they\xe2\x80\x99ve all made an important contribution to the community in which they live, and that makes them important representatives of how much Muslim Americans across the country have to contribute to the communities in which they live.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know if any of the people in the roundtable were victims of bias or discrimination or any behavior of that sort?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I will leave it to them to tell their stories. \xc2\xa0And you obviously have all of their names, and we can help connect you with them directly. \xc2\xa0But if those individuals want to tell their stories, they can do that. \xc2\xa0Why don\'t I just say in general that part of the discussion that the President had earlier today did talk about some of the stereotypes and bias that many Muslim Americans are subjected to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President is expected to talk a little bit about national security here, as well, as I understand it. \xc2\xa0Is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, the President certainly will talk about national security while he\xe2\x80\x99s here as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing that not encourage this bias? \xc2\xa0I mean, what does national security got to do with these people? \xc2\xa0Why is every time somebody opens their mouth about Muslims you have to have some kind of (inaudible) about national security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0And I think, Andrew, what the President is hoping to reinforce is a message that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from us before, which is that we know that there are extremist organizations like ISIL that are seeking to infiltrate Muslim communities both in the United States and around the world. \xc2\xa0And the question is, as somebody who has a responsibility to protect the American people, the question the President asks is what is going to be our most effective strategy for countering that. \xc2\xa0And the strategy that is proposed by some is to automatically assume that every Muslim in America is a potential terrorist. \xc2\xa0That actually is going to undermine our strategy to keep the American people safe. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes, rather, that we should enter into a partnership with the Muslim community. \xc2\xa0After all, it is leaders in Muslim communities who, as much as anyone else, are interested in countering the efforts of terrorist organizations like ISIL from radicalizing vulnerable members of their community. \xc2\xa0So why not work with them in that effort both to safeguard their communities but also to safeguard the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ll do a couple more. \xc2\xa0Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any thought of inviting Republicans today? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure exactly how the list -- I think the list was put together in terms of members of Congress who were invited. \xc2\xa0We invited the local congressional delegation as well as two Muslim members of Congress. \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any interest that was expressed by Republicans to attend the event, but I\'m confident that they were not intentionally excluded. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday you called Mitch McConnell a committed supporter of TPP. \xc2\xa0He went up on the Hill and said that there were a number of flaws with the bill and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if he could support it. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of disjoint there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I was -- I tried to be careful in my comments, and if -- I needed to be more precise than I should have been. \xc2\xa0The point that I have made -- and I know I\'ve said this a number of times -- we know that people like Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan and many other Republicans in the United States Congress are supportive of agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that would, for example, cut taxes on 18,000 American goods that are imposed by other countries. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll leave it to Leader McConnell to render his judgment on this specific agreement. \xc2\xa0We certainly are going to advocate to him and to Democrats and Republicans alike that this is a good agreement that is clearly in the best interest of our country and our economy. \xc2\xa0But I\'ll let him say whether or not he supports it. \xc2\xa0I think there will be a lot in here -- based on his public comments in the past, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in this agreement for him to like.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s economy minister resigned today. \xc2\xa0He said he was under pressure to appoint people who would have blocked some anti-corruption practices that the U.S. has backed. \xc2\xa0Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s the latest sign of instability in the Poroshenko government. \xc2\xa0Do you guys have a response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the Ukrainian government is under intense pressure because of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in their country. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we have pushed hard for the implementation of the Minsk agreement to try to resolve that instability. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that we have repeatedly encouraged the Ukrainian government to consider and move forward in implementing needed reforms in their government and in their economy. \xc2\xa0Much of the assistance that we have provided has been contingent on the successful implementation of some of those reforms. \xc2\xa0We\'re pleased with the kind of progress that the Ukrainian government has made in implementing those reforms. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to do, and they can count on the support and partnership of the United States as they implement those reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A quick one on the Brexit, just because it\'s so hot right now in Britain. \xc2\xa0What is the White House position on how it would affect the U.S. relationship with Britain if the UK leaves the EU? \xc2\xa0And what would it mean for the economy and NATO?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, ultimately, this will be a decision for the British people to decide -- or a decision for the British people to make. \xc2\xa0And I know that Prime Minister Cameron has made some commitments to the British people about national consideration of this question. \xc2\xa0The U.S. position has long been that we benefit as a country and as a broader NATO alliance from a strong UK being a member of a strong EU. \xc2\xa0And all of that is something that we want to encourage. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in terms of the kinds of decisions that need to be made by the British people about the best kind of relationship, that\'s a decision that they should make. \xc2\xa0And it sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to do so relatively soon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Valerie Jarrett was in the roundtable. \xc2\xa0Was there anyone else of note from the White House who was in the roundtable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s some other White House staffers, including Melissa Rogers, who is the Director of Faith Outreach at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy don\'t we let you guys go and get a seat for the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you guys. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:07 P.M.
