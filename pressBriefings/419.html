Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:41 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the lengthy delay in advance of today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 A lot of news to get through.\xc2\xa0 So since there\xe2\x80\x99s so much going on, Julie, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just go straight to questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President said in his interview over the weekend that the strategy that he\xe2\x80\x99ll announce for going after the Islamic State is going to look like a counterterrorism campaign.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain a bit more what that means?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President also mentioned in his interview is his intention to give a speech on Wednesday to discuss some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that speech.\xc2\xa0 But let me try to give you a sense of at least what the President is thinking when he says something like that.</p>\n<p>As the President confronts the situation and the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL, he puts the safety and security of the American people at the top of his list of concerns.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that he has ordered thus far in Iraq to strike ISIL is principally motivated to protect American personnel, including at our embassy and our consulate in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the focal point of our operations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, there are some other objectives that we\xe2\x80\x99re also pursuing in terms of providing some humanitarian assistance to those religious and ethnic minorities that are being targeted by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 There also are some specific counterterrorism operations that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in there, as we have been for some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But when the President is making these decisions, particularly as it relates to an organization like ISIL, what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on is the safety and security of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the threat that this extremist organization principally poses to the homeland is in the form of foreign fighters, individuals with Western passports that have traveled to the region and taken up arms to fight alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 There is significant concern about the idea that some of these individuals may try to travel back to the West using their Western passports and carry out acts of violence or engage in terrorism here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So as it relates to our principal concern about the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL, the President is concerned about the threat of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the other counterterrorism operations that this administration has carried are a relevant reference point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One of the other things that the President mentioned in his interview is that we have seen the United States effectively, under the leadership of this President, and thanks to the courage and service of men and women in uniform and the intelligence agencies, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very effectively to defeat terrorists who pose a threat to the United States.\xc2\xa0 That is true of the success of our efforts to decimate al Qaeda core in the border region and along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also true in some of the counterterrorism efforts that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the administration and the President order in Yemen, in Somalia and other places.</p>\n<p>So what the President is trying to do is trying to illustrate that there is a track record here that people can evaluate.\xc2\xa0 And each of these situations is different, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to consider each of them differently.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of evaluating what the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief concern is and what our solution looks like, it is similar to some of these other counterterrorism missions that the President has ordered and have been successfully executed by the United States military and with the support and in conjunction with our allies around the world, and of course the support of American intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned some of the counterterrorism missions.\xc2\xa0 People often think about this in the context of Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia, which tend to be missions that are kind of shrouded in secrecy.\xc2\xa0 The administration in some cases doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even acknowledge that these are happening.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what the President is talking about here, though, when he talks about counterterrorism, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been engaged in an effort -- and he gave a speech on this earlier this year -- his desire and our collective effort to try to bring some more transparency to some of these issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you get my point.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s one type of counterterrorism mission.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the type of mission he appears to be talking about here, though, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, each of these situations is a little bit different, and each of them has their own unique threat.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess what I would say is the President has been pretty clear about what he\xe2\x80\x99s contemplating.\xc2\xa0 The President is not contemplating the deployment of combat boots on the ground into Iraq or Syria to deal with this situation.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talking about building a broader, international coalition, engaging regional governments, looking for the support and the effective governance of the Iraqi central government to confront this threat.</p>\n<p>Is it possible that there might be some clandestine efforts that are also underway here?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s something that I won\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position to talk about if they do occur.\xc2\xa0 But what the President is talking about is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out a couple of time and will have the opportunity to talk about at more length on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made a decision on whether airstrikes should extend into Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is he -- and he said this, again, in the interview that he conducted over the week -- is his willingness to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening America.\xc2\xa0 And that has been true in a range of other circumstances.\xc2\xa0 To the extent that there are parallels here, the President ordered this military to go after Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And that was sort of the President fulfilling a campaign promise that he made in a speech -- I believe was in the summer of 2007 -- where he talked about his commitment as Commander-in-Chief to deploying American resources wherever necessary to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a useful guideline as you try to assess the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about some of these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To play that out -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to go after groups that threaten Americans wherever they are, and you say ISIS could pose a threat to Americans, and they\xe2\x80\x99re in Syria, has he then made a decision to go after them inside Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if the President has made a decision along these lines, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that would rise to the level of the President making the announcement about that decision.\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do is provide you some insight into the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I was successful in that effort, but it certainly was a valiant effort.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President also said in his interview that he did not believe he needed further authorization for action on this plan, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also been very clear that this is a long-term thing.\xc2\xa0 So how do those two elements jive?\xc2\xa0 If this is going to go on for more than just a couple months, what does he need from Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the administration has demonstrated in a pretty transparent way our commitment to closely consulting with members of Congress as we pursue these kinds of foreign policy/national security priorities.\xc2\xa0 The President has convened a couple of meetings with leaders in Congress to discuss these issues before they went away on their August recess six weeks or so ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has invited the four leaders of Congress -- the Democratic and Republican leader of both the House and the Senate -- to come to the White House tomorrow to discuss some of these issues and to follow up on the very successful NATO Summit that the President attended in Wales at the end of last week.\xc2\xa0 So the President is committed to intensive consultations between the administration and Congress as we consider some of these very difficult and very high-stakes questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition to that, I think the President has long believed -- and this is something that the President has articulated in different -- as he\xe2\x80\x99s confronted different national security questions.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that when the American people, through their elected representatives, can demonstrate a united front across party lines, that that\xe2\x80\x99s beneficial to our foreign policy; that that sends a clear signal to people all around the world that the American people are united in pursuing and accomplishing a specific foreign policy or national security priority.</p>\n<p>So the President, in his interview with Chuck Todd at NBC, was clear that he does believe that he has the authority to \xe2\x80\x9cdo what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But he went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Congress to understand what the plan is, to have buy-in, to debate it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been consulting with Congress throughout.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So there will continue to be an effort to keep an open line of dialogue between the administration and leaders in Congress as we move on this important foreign policy priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So dialogue, but no need to ask for authorization.\xc2\xa0 Is that a correct understanding of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the way the President described it is he believed that it was important to understand what the plan is, to have buy-in, to debate it, and engage in the kinds of consultations that this administration is leading right now.\xc2\xa0 And that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Debate it does not mean vote on it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just clarifying if that\xe2\x80\x99s what that means.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is not in a position where he sets the legislative floor calendar for either the House or the Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s in a position of asking for them to authorize or not authorize.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s not just in a position of asking, he\xe2\x80\x99s also in a position of consulting and trying to be as candid as possible with leaders in Congress about what he\xe2\x80\x99s contemplating and what the policy implications are of some of the decisions that he is prepared to make.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important in the mind of the President for Congress to be a partner in these decisions.\xc2\xa0 They have a solemn responsibility as the elected representatives of the American people to be engaged in this process.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, it is the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief to make the kinds of decisions related to our military that rest on the shoulders of the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also said that there might be a need for more resources.\xc2\xa0 Can you address what kind of money request or funding request he might end up submitting to Congress as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of any funding request to preview at this point.\xc2\xa0 I would remind you in a speech that I believe that you covered, Jeff, when the President traveled to West Point, he talked about his interest in the creation of this Counterterrorism Partnership Fund.\xc2\xa0 And this is a core component of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for dealing with this and other issues like it around the globe.\xc2\xa0 That is additional resources that can be used by the United States to build up effective partners so that when the United States has to confront threats like this, that we have well-trained, well-equipped, effective partners that we can work with to confront these problems.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we need to get into a position where the United States is not solely responsible for dealing with these kinds of emerging threats; that we want to be able to work closely with partners around the globe, partners who have better knowledge of the local politics, who have better knowledge of the local terrain, who in some cases can prevent some of these situations from becoming so urgent and so severe.\xc2\xa0 And that is one example of a funding request that the President has made to members of Congress that I think that members of Congress have talked about but have not voted on.\xc2\xa0 And the President would certainly like to see those kinds of resources be provided because it would strengthen the hand of this President and future Presidents for dealing with urgent situations like this.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You mentioned earlier the President\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding commitment to counterterrorism operations -- one of them, but one the administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk about a lot was the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki.\xc2\xa0 And given the administration talks a lot about the 100 American citizens who are fighting alongside ISIS and potentially could come back here and pose a threat here, I was wondering whether the President has sought out any sort of legal justification like he did in that case and is considering the use of -- using whether drone strikes or direct airstrikes on potentially American citizens?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Zeke, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of policy announcement to make along these lines.\xc2\xa0 I would point out the administration has sought, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, to try to provide additional insight to the American public and to working journalists about the legal justification and the decision that was made to strike threats in Somalia and Yemen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as it relates to ISIL more generally, we are concerned about the threat that is posed by these foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 There are -- it is believed by some analysts that there are dozens of individuals with American passports who have traveled to the region and taken up arms to fight alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Now, there are some reports that indicate that there is a risk that those individuals could return to the West, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the United States or one of our allies, using their Western American passport to travel either completely unimpeded or relatively unimpeded in a way that poses a threat to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the President will not hesitate to take the actions that he believes are necessary to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And following up there, there\xe2\x80\x99s potential legislation on Capitol Hill in terms of either stripping citizenship or taking action on passports of Americans who are serving -- who are fighting alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Is that a measure we can expect to hear more from the President about on Wednesday?\xc2\xa0 And is that something he would support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about some of those proposals; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at them specifically.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a position on them at this point.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned to Jeff, the administration certainly is interested in working in a partnership with members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, as we confront this threat.</p>\n<p>Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to degrade and destroy ISIL, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put boots on the ground.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 American combat boots on the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 American combat boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, in response to Chuck Todd of NBC News --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of that guy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President -- Chuck asked him, well, who is going to go into Syria, and the President said Syrians like the Free Syrian Army are going to occupy that space -- assuming the President is successful in pushing ISIL back from its Syrian strongholds.\xc2\xa0 The Free Syrian Army, the administration has been reluctant to arm them all along; you\xe2\x80\x99ve been reluctant to allow countries like Saudi Arabia to send them shoulder-launched ground-to-air missiles, the MANPADS.\xc2\xa0 Some of the equipment that has been transferred to them has reportedly shown up in ISIS hands in Iraq, fighting against American, Kurdish and Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 Why is the Free Syrian Army now a more viable and trustworthy fighting force than it was just a few months ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is one aspect of your question that I want to quibble with just a little bit, which is that we have for more than a year now been providing both non-military and military support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lethal military support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been providing military support is the term of our --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming now you\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide them with lethal military support if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be actually carrying a fight as a proxy for this coalition.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that support from the Obama administration has been flowing to the moderate Syrian opposition for more than a year now, and that includes military support.\xc2\xa0 The President has sought -- and this was in the context of the West Point speech that I mentioned in response to Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s question a little bit earlier -- the administration has sought additional resources, using our Title 10 authority, to ramp up that assistance to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly would, we would hope and expect, improve their capacity and success in taking the fight to the Assad regime and to ISIL to essentially -- or to effectively wage that battle on behalf of the citizens of their country to try to retake their country.\xc2\xa0 So there is an effort that has been underway for some time.\xc2\xa0 We have, as you point out, sought to increase or ramp up that assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the question you\xe2\x80\x99re asking though is a somewhat more complicated one, which is the question is, why?\xc2\xa0 Why them, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And why now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who else?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And who else.\xc2\xa0 So I guess you have three complicated questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, you were just -- to point out there are no American boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So who are the boots on the ground?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was, I was.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting -- it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated but not illegitimate.\xc2\xa0 Why them?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s their country.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President -- I think the President, again, in the interview that we\xe2\x80\x99re all citing, described it as a profound mistake to commit American combat boots to being on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 This is not a fight that the United States can take on for them.\xc2\xa0 The United States is willing to be supportive of the Syrian opposition as they try to put in place a government that reflects the will of the Syrian people, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was their country three years ago.\xc2\xa0 Three years later, 162,000 people are dead, there are millions of refugees all over the region.\xc2\xa0 Again, why not then?\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it effectuated back then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, again, a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is the United States has been engaged in an effort to support them, and we have been for some time -- for more than a year, at least.\xc2\xa0 Separately, the concern that was expressed by the administration at the time and has been -- is something that\xe2\x80\x99s been often repeated, is a concern that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to provide assistance to every individual who said that they were fighting Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 Had we done that without thoroughly vetting them and building the kind of relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to understand who we\xe2\x80\x99re providing weapons to, we would have inadvertently provided weapons to the very people we\xe2\x80\x99re now fighting in Iraq.</p>\n<p>So there was a question of who exactly was included in the Syrian opposition, and which of those elements were interested in putting in place a government that actually reflected the will and diversity of the Syrian people, and which of those were members of the opposition who were actually extremists, who were hoping to use the power vacuum that\xe2\x80\x99s been created by this civil war in Syria to try to carry out their own vision of an Islamic caliphate in this region.</p>\n<p>So the reason that the administration was interested in carefully vetting the individuals who were part of the Syrian opposition is because we wanted to make sure that our assistance was landing in the hands of the people who were trying to create a government that reflected the will of the Syrian people and not to create an Islamic caliphate that was carrying out acts of violence throughout the region.</p>\n<p>So this challenge of vetting the opposition certainly contributed to the policy of this administration to ramp up our assistance to that opposition over time after we had established some relationships and had the opportunity to vet these individuals and get a better sense about what their intentions actually were.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Jeff asked you a series of very direct questions and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a direct answer.\xc2\xa0 So can you just --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please help me with a yes or no.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to ask Congress for authorization to expand his campaign against ISIL?\xc2\xa0 Just a yes or no?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President was asked this direction question and he --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t give a direct answer either.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if you can give me, seriously, a yes or no.\xc2\xa0 Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what buy-in -- I covered Congress for years; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean by you saying you want to have congressional buy-in.\xc2\xa0 Buy-in, it seems to me, would imply a vote of some kind, either a vote on appropriations or a vote on an authorization or a sense of Congress resolution, but some kind of a vote.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you want from Congress -- a vote on this?\xc2\xa0 Yes or no?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if you want to get some insight into the President\xe2\x80\x99s current thinking about this, then I would refer you to the answer that he gave to Chuck in the interview 48 hours ago.\xc2\xa0 But the other thing that I would point out that\xe2\x80\x99s also part of your question is if the President decides to expand the operation.\xc2\xa0 And these are the kinds of questions that are best answered after the President has made some fundamental decisions about what he wants to do there -- that if there is an expansion in the operation that takes place, what consequences are there for a whole range of things:\xc2\xa0 for our diplomatic relationships, what kind of assistance are we going to seek from our partners; what kind of assistance would we seek from regional governments in terms of the role that they could play here; and what role does Congress have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to -- unless we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a very specific order from the President, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to talk in very specific terms about what we want Congress to do.</p>\n<p>But as a general matter, what I can say is that the President is interesting in their buy-in, is interested in a congressional debate, and is interested in consulting closely with the leaders in Congress so that they feel bought into this process and they feel like the partners that they actually are, as the elected representatives to the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because we remember that the President did make a decision on airstrikes on Syria under very different circumstances but previously, and his decision at that point was that he needed congressional authorization or that he wanted congressional authorization.\xc2\xa0 If he were to go in that direction again and decide that some kind of an extended air campaign against ISIL targets in Syria were necessary, is it safe to assume he would have the same view that he would need, want congressional authorization?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the situation from last year is a little bit different than the situation this year; that the situation from last year was related specifically to this issue of chemical weapons being used by the Assad regime against the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 The situation right now is related directly to the protection of American citizens in the region.\xc2\xa0 The President does believe that he has all the authority necessary as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States to order the kind of military action that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect American citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including strikes in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But again, if there is an expansion of the President\xe2\x80\x99s military orders, or if there is an expansion of the scope of operations that the President is willing to consider, at the point that the President has made that decision we can start making decisions about what sort of congressional role or authorization is required, if any.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Give me a sense on the timeline for a decision on this.\xc2\xa0 Is this something the President is considering right now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this something we should expect in the next day or two, or is this something over a course of weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9cthis\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The decision on whether or not to expand military operations that you just referred to.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been regularly consulting with his national security team for weeks now.\xc2\xa0 And when they are having these meetings, they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about our broader strategy for confronting the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And there are a range of elements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed quite a few times here in terms of our diplomacy with the Iraqis trying to form a central government.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve made tremendous progress on that over the next last couple weeks, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that this week they\xe2\x80\x99ll make some additional important progress in forming a cabinet.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s important work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done by the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s traveling to the region this week where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be consulting with regional governments.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was pretty powerful in explaining the role that these governments in the region have and the stake that they have in resolving this conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President highlighted that so often these Sunni-dominated governments perceive Shia-led governments as the principal threat to their ability to lead their country and to remain in power.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view -- and I think that there is some justification for this based on the facts that we see on the ground there -- that they actually face a great threat from more extremist Sunni elements that have demonstrated significant capacity to wreak havoc in their region.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also a diplomatic effort to engage the international community here.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of intelligence efforts that the President has already ordered.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit about how the President at the beginning of this situation ordered an increase in intelligence assets to get a better sense of what sort of -- to get a better sense of what actually was happening on the ground and to better assess the capability of both ISIL but also the Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 But also, as you point out, the other element of this strategy is the use of military force.\xc2\xa0 That is part of the strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m running through this long list here is to illustrate to you that there are -- that this broad strategy that the President has put in place to deal with this is something that is regularly discussed among his team.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re discussing every element of this strategy at each of these meetings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in his speech on Wednesday -- and first of all, is this a primetime address or a daytime speech?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working through the logistics of the speech that the President wants to give.\xc2\xa0 And so once we have some more details on that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the purpose of the speech to announce a new phase in this military operation, or to outline what he has already outlined in different venues -- the interview over the weekend, the press conferences on his last trip -- what his strategy is vis-\xc3\xa0-vis ISIL?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the speech isn\xe2\x80\x99t written yet, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of describing a speech that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been written yet.\xc2\xa0 But generally --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But trying to go forward, is the purpose to explain what he\xe2\x80\x99s already doing or to announce something new?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that there might be something new in the speech.\xc2\xa0 But the principal goal here is to make sure that people understand what the clear stake is for the American people and our nation in this ongoing violence that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 He also wants to describe what sort of tools are at the disposal of the American government as they try to protect our interests and our people in the region.</p>\n<p>And the President wants to try to lay that out pretty clearly.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the President may have something new to say in the speech?\xc2\xa0 He might.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait until the speech is written before I start guessing about where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to end up.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when you were asked a moment ago, has the President decided to expand the air war into Syria, you said the President said he will go wherever is necessary.\xc2\xa0 That sounded like a very near confirmation that he has decided that.\xc2\xa0 Should that be interpreted that way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No -- because if the President has made a specific decision like this to expand our military operations, then you can expect that the President himself would announce a decision like that, not just little old me here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How should we interpret your answer that he\xe2\x80\x99ll go wherever is necessary?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a statement of the President\xe2\x80\x99s view in terms of what sort of authority he has as the Commander-in-Chief to confront these challenges.\xc2\xa0 And the President is determined to act where necessary to protect American citizens both in the region, but here in the homeland.\xc2\xa0 And the President has demonstrated a willingness to do that on a number of occasions already, and that principle continues to apply in this situation, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of whether, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of timing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if and when the President has made a decision along these lines, it will be something that the President will announce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the purpose of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s speech?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, the purpose of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech on Wednesday is broader than that.\xc2\xa0 Again, military action is one element of our strategy, and the President does have this integrated strategy that relies very heavily on America\xe2\x80\x99s forceful diplomatic might and a range of other assets that we have at our disposal.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to use all of them to deal with this specific challenge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s just say, for the sake of argument, I was an American who watched the President\xe2\x80\x99s press conference at the end of the NATO Summit and watched the interview yesterday.\xc2\xa0 After seeing Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s speech, will I say to myself, wow, there\xe2\x80\x99s like 70 percent brand new?\xc2\xa0 Or is it going to be like -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a particularly creative way to ask that question.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is I would encourage that American citizen that you\xe2\x80\x99re describing to tune into the speech and evaluate for themselves to see how surprised they are by the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come on, you can give us something better.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a little early for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you more or less said to Jonathan it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly going to be what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard before; there might be something new.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it to try to gather the American people\xe2\x80\x99s attention and say, in case you haven\'t heard -- (laughter) -- here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about, here\xe2\x80\x99s the context, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the declarative speech on how I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ratchet up this conflict to a higher military level, and I need Congress to approve it, and here\xe2\x80\x99s how much it\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline I\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of put together to envision achieving goals X,Y and Z?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still a couple days away from the speech, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to provide additional guidance to you right now of what the President may or may not say.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to try this again tomorrow and maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared with a little bit more to say about this.</p>\n<p>Look, the President and his team are working on the speech as we speak.\xc2\xa0 So as we get some more details locked down, I will try -- I\xe2\x80\x99m probably over-committing myself now -- but I will try to provide at least a little bit greater insight for you and your viewers about what the President intends to talk about on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on immigration for a second, because I just want to be clear -- what the President decided Saturday was that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any executive action until after the November election, right?\xc2\xa0 Or has he decided to revisit the entire question of taking executive action until after the election?\xc2\xa0 Because to my mind, and many advocates who have been pushing for this, they are very different things.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to clarify this -- to the extent that there is any ambiguity here.\xc2\xa0 The President has decided that he will take executive action within the confines of the law to fix those aspects of the broken immigration system that he\xe2\x80\x99s able to fix before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And that is a decision that he has made, and that is something that will occur.</p>\n<p>Now, some of the static that you might say in the media over the weekend was related to the President\xe2\x80\x99s earlier commitment to acting before the end of the summer.\xc2\xa0 What the President has decided is that he will act now before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 The President has not in any way altered his commitment or interest in taking executive action -- again, within the confines of the law -- to solve to act where Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and more specifically, to act where congressional Republicans have blocked congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to acting on this before the end of the year has not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said yesterday that the reason for that is he needs to explain it to the American people.\xc2\xa0 Why does he need until the end of the year to explain something?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true that the dominant factor -- if you want to call it static -- was static from Senate Democrats saying this is a -- maybe you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, but it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible politics for us and we want you to wait until after the election?\xc2\xa0 The President clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need nine weeks to explain this to the American people.\xc2\xa0 If he wanted to explain it, he could explain it -- just like he\xe2\x80\x99s going to try to explain the strategy on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 It seems to me the only rational explanation for this is an intervening midterm election and fears from Senate Democrats that they did not want to take this issue on in the teeth of an already tough political environment.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major, the reason that the President has made the decision to delay his announcement about executive actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take is specifically because he is concerned mostly about ensuring the solution that he offers is both sustainable and enduring.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s an executive action, it is sustainable by definition until the end of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole point.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President wants to do is he wants to ensure that all of the work that has been done over the last several years to build this powerful bipartisan coalition in support of immigration reform is sustained.\xc2\xa0 And by injecting an executive action in the midst of this hyper-partisan, hyper-political environment shortly before the midterms, that will have a negative impact on the broader public support and on the sustainability of immigration reform.</p>\n<p>So I guess the short answer to your question is, the President is willing to take a little political heat from the pundits, from some of the advocates in the Hispanic community in particular, in order to ensure that the policy that he puts forward is one that can be sustained.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is we haven\'t seen a similar willingness from congressional Republicans to take a little heat to do what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen congressional Republicans do exactly the opposite.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a situation where they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take any political heat, even though they know that acting on bipartisan immigration reform would create jobs, it would expand economic growth, it would reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s strongly supported by the faith community, by the law enforcement community, by the business community, by the labor community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are all reasons why comprehensive immigration reform should move forward.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it passed with bipartisan support in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But there is a small but vocal group among congressional Republicans in the House of Representatives who are blocking this kind of reform.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only reason we\xe2\x80\x99re having this question right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not doing what he said he was going to do on the timeline, he said he was going to do it as an act of courage.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has done -- I mean, look, Major, it\xe2\x80\x99s a not a surprise to anybody at the White House, or it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t a surprise to me -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak for my colleagues -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise to me that there were some people in the newspaper over the weekend who were critical of the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to announce these executive actions before the end of the year as opposed to the end of the summer.\xc2\xa0 That criticism was not a surprise; that criticism was anticipated.\xc2\xa0 But the President is willing to take on that criticism so that we can ensure that the executive action that the President takes is sustained, that it\xe2\x80\x99s enduring, and that we continue to have public support for it.</p>\n<p>Look, for all the disagreement that there may be around this one issue, there should be no disputing the fact that injecting this issue into the current political environment would be really bad for the issue.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some disagreement about whether or not, well, maybe it would help some Democrats, maybe it would hurt some others, maybe it would galvanize base Democratic voters, maybe it would energize Latino supporters, maybe it would provoke Republican candidates into doing outrageous things like shutting down the government in a way that would benefit Democrats.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of people with a lot of different views about what possible impact this could have on individual races.\xc2\xa0 But there is no arguing about the fact that injecting this issue into this sharply political, polarized environment would be bad for the issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President believes ultimately that that\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing -- that making progress on this issue is the most important thing.\xc2\xa0 No one in Washington, D.C. has invested more in trying to get this done than President Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0 And if that means the President has to take on a little bit more heat here for a few weeks until we announce our decision in order to make it more likely that these solutions will be enduring and sustained and successful, the President is happy to take on that heat in order to get that done.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I wanted to just follow on that and maybe argue with the idea that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that injecting that into the current political climate is bad for the issue.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we just went through a year of you guys saying time and again that House Republicans haven\'t moved on the issue, it seems legislatively dead in every possible way.\xc2\xa0 And so the only X factor out here seems to be control of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can maybe explain explicitly why an executive action would make -- if it were to come this week, would be less enduring than one that happens five weeks from now -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s not what I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all dancing around, which is that it helps Senate Democrats to retain control of the chamber.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The reason that immigration reform over the last five years has made so much progress --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has it made progress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it passed the Senate with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 We got 14 Republicans to vote for it, and every single Democrat in the Senate voted for it.\xc2\xa0 We also know -- although we haven\'t tested the proposition -- but I think everybody in here -- let me know if you disagree -- but I think everybody is willing to stipulate that if this legislation that passed through the Senate in bipartisan fashion were put on the floor of the House of Representatives, that it would also pass with bipartisan support, with a bipartisan majority, the President would certainly sign it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of significant progress.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ancient history to cite the experience of 2006 where you had Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the issue reluctant to engage in a debate about it, let alone reluctanct to vote for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we have made a lot of progress over the last five years.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that I think is twofold.\xc2\xa0 The first is, it\xe2\x80\x99s become clear what the facts are. The facts are that it would be good for job creation.\xc2\xa0 It would be good for economic growth, it would reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0 So the facts are clear about why Congress should take action on this.</p>\n<p>The second thing is, a lot of very difficult work was done between Democrats and Republicans to try to find some common ground.\xc2\xa0 That is harder than it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been in this town.\xc2\xa0 But thanks to the dutiful efforts of members of this administration, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, they brokered some common-sense common ground and cobbled together a legislative proposal that would do a lot of good for the country.\xc2\xa0 It meant that neither side got every single thing that they wanted, but they were able to arrive at a piece of legislation that everybody acknowledges would be really good for the country.</p>\n<p>So there is painstaking work that was put into striking that compromise.\xc2\xa0 Now, what we have also seen in the context of these midterm elections is a pretty gross distortion about the facts of our immigration system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s going to change after the midterm elections?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what will change is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be past it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of the Republican candidates --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but listen -- think about it, Justin.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of the Republican candidates right now are contemplating a six-figure ad buy the third week in November.\xc2\xa0 Are they?\xc2\xa0 If they are, I hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll spend their money that way, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to.\xc2\xa0 So the tone and heightened nature of the debate will just be different.\xc2\xa0 Will there still be Republicans who are against common-sense immigration reform?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I readily concede that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 But will they be in less of a position to distort the facts about what that position actually is?\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think they will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why does that affect the sustainability of the President\xe2\x80\x99s eventual --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because the reason that the President feels confident about -- well, let me take that in two ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is we want to preserve the strong public support that currently exists for immigration reform; that we have worked hard in painstaking fashion to cobble together this coalition of Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C. and business leaders and labor leaders and faith leaders and leaders in the law enforcement community all across the country in support of this proposal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But by injecting it into the highly charged political debate six or eight weeks before the midterm elections is to subject this issue to gross distortion and partisanship that could alter that balance.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that.\xc2\xa0 And that means the President is willing to take on a little heat and be criticized by -- certainly by Republicans, but even by members of his own party in order to protect the issue -- because ultimately that is the goal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said for quite some time that the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal here is solving problems and not playing politics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to square the last circle in this maybe, why is this diffused as an issue if, as you just said maybe 15 minutes ago, you\xe2\x80\x99re pledging to take this executive action by the end of the year?\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we going to see a six-figure ad buy from a Republican going up against a vulnerable Democrat, saying the President not only is still going to do this but now he\xe2\x80\x99s playing politics to hook the issue.\xc2\xa0 Have you really diffused this or taken this out of the political discussion?\xc2\xa0 Or have you just kind of punted it and kept it alive as an issue but now people aren\xe2\x80\x99t kind of getting the relief that they would otherwise?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there is a difference between the President indicating a willingness to act and -- or a commitment to act even, and actually announcing what that action is.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is a tangible difference there in a way that will reduce the amount of incoming, if you will, that the issue will take.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately what\xe2\x80\x99s driving this decision.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the last sentence in the latest War Powers letter that the President sent to the Congress says, \xe2\x80\x9cI appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How and where was that support here expressed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of public comments from Democrats and Republicans indicating that they support the decisions that the President has made to order military action in Iraq to protect American citizens there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not Congress speaking as -- I mean, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say, I thank some Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 He is explicitly assuming full congressional support for what he\xe2\x80\x99s done, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the War Powers report notification in front of me.\xc2\xa0 If you want to read it to me again, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI appreciate the support of the Congress in this action.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does he consider the leadership to be sufficient?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting back to this whole notion of a vote or not a vote, obviously, but he seems to be assuming it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen public comments from rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans as well that indicate their support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to order military action to protect American citizens in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to stipulate that, yes, they have not voted on this at this point, and voting on it is different than them talking about it.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of them articulating support that the President appreciates, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many Democrats and Republicans do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the past couple weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ve had senior officials say -- I think one on CNN and some elsewhere -- that this conflict to degrade and destroy the Islamic State could run three years or more.\xc2\xa0 And we had news over the weekend of airstrikes on targets that I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how it fits the President\xe2\x80\x99s contention that this is a mission about safeguarding the security of American personnel and installations in Iraq when you\xe2\x80\x99re striking targets like IS around the Haditha Dam, for example.\xc2\xa0 It seems like the President, for all his public comments about mission creep, is overseeing a fairly steady expansion of a conflict in scope and now in duration as well.\xc2\xa0 Is that an incorrect assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is that there is a direct threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL taking control of the Haditha Dam to American personnel in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There also is this broader effort to support the Iraqi security forces as they are engaged in taking the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an example of our efforts to try to support them in a way that, again, safeguards the American citizens who are already there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the direct threat to American personnel from --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s been described to me is that there is a threat that if ISIL decided to destroy the Haditha Dam, that it could threaten -- or would threaten the airport downstream from the dam.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told that that was true of Mosul Dam, as well, and is true in this case.</p>\n<p>Move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the -- and I want to follow up on Olivier -- because the buy-in phrase sounds squirrely.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about buy-in, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to give Congress just enough authority, just enough of a role to agree with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position but not enough to say no.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration intend to give Congress a role to shape policy about ISIS, to shape policy and action?\xc2\xa0 Or is it just to buy into the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, Jared, that the level of consultation that this administration has demonstrated a commitment to indicates our genuine interest in a dialogue with members of Congress about our policy in Iraq and Syria, and our policy more broadly for confronting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I think that is evidenced by the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re having continuous conversations.\xc2\xa0 Some of the conversations have occurred before the President has made important decisions.\xc2\xa0 There have been regular consultation from the Department of Defense and the Department of State, other senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team here at the White House.</p>\n<p>So there has been intensive consultation, and that is evidence of our genuine interest in members of Congress partnering with this administration as we develop a policy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL and to protect American citizens in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about buy-in, buy-in kind of exists in this rhetorical gray area, where it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite a vote so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have them shaping policy -- at least, again, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t clarified it, despite getting several questions about it.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like it\xe2\x80\x99s quite so far as negotiating on policy, negotiating on strategy and voting on it.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just enough responsibility for Congress to maybe share some of the blame if something were to go wrong or if something were to happen, but not enough to actually say no to the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies.\xc2\xa0 Is any member of Congress going to get the ability to say no to the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy to fight ISIS in Syria or Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jared, it is the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief to make decisions about the use of our military to protect American citizens.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that he has all of the authorization that is required to make those kinds of decisions.</p>\n<p>That said, we welcome Congress as a partner as we confront some of these very difficult and high-stakes national security issues.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress wants to participate in this process, we certainly would welcome their participation in a constructive way.\xc2\xa0 But our level of engagement indicates our legitimate interest in congressional consultation and in congressional action that is contributing to this broader effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about if Congress wants to do this, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like there\xe2\x80\x99s a sign-up board.\xc2\xa0 They have a constitutional role here.\xc2\xa0 And obviously depending on whether it\xe2\x80\x99s authorization or appropriations -- there are different rules for each aspect of this -- but you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about something that sounds volitional.\xc2\xa0 Congress has a duty here.\xc2\xa0 Is the President trying to limit their duties as it goes against authorization or appropriation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m merely stating the fact that the President is the Commander-in-Chief, and that means he is the one that is ultimately responsible for making decisions about ordering military action.\xc2\xa0 But you are right -- you\xe2\x80\x99re saying something that I said early on in this briefing, which is that there is a role for Congress to play here.\xc2\xa0 And how they choose to play that role is obviously up to them.\xc2\xa0 They are a separate branch of government.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make decisions about what pieces of legislation find their way to the floor of the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 It certainly would be a good thing in our view if the President did have some authority over that, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It certainly would allow us to confront some of the other problems that House Republicans have refused to vote on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, we are interested in careful and close consultation with members of Congress in both parties, in both Houses of Congress, and we are interested in their buy-in, as the President described.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no opposite to buy-in.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Excuse me?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no way for them to say no.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about buy-in, it\xe2\x80\x99s one-directional.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you mean, Jared.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, if members of Congress want to put forward a piece of legislation saying the President should not act or should not order military force to protect American citizens in Iraq and Syria, they\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to vote on that.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President won\xe2\x80\x99t have a vote and the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t determine whether or not that goes onto the floor of the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 So Congress does have some volitional aspect to this.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about what we would like them to do -- or at least a little clear.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed -- they obviously -- there are a variety of ways for them to demonstrate their support or opposition to this policy, and that can range from everything from an interview or a piece of legislation that they vote on, and a range of things in between, as you pointed out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to say at this point is we are interested in members of Congress and Congress as an institution working closely with the President as he confronts these difficult challenges.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is really simple, Jared.\xc2\xa0 The reason is the President believes that our foreign policy is more forceful, it\xe2\x80\x99s more impactful when we can demonstrate to the world that the United States of America is united in support of this priority.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a quick sidebar issue since the briefing started.\xc2\xa0 The Baltimore Ravens have announced they\xe2\x80\x99ve terminated the contract of Ray Rice.\xc2\xa0 I realize you did not know that, but probably have seen or heard about this pretty dramatic, horrific video of him beating up his wife.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken out on this issue a lot.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President I think today is having an issue -- an event about the passage of the Violence Against Women Act.\xc2\xa0 What kind of comment could the White House offer about this situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the news because of what you just said, but let me say it this way:\xc2\xa0 This administration and this President do believe strongly that the scourge of violence against women is something that needs to be aggressively combatted.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on the individual decisions that are made by, in this case, an individual NFL team, but you have seen the President and the Vice President make very forceful public comments in talking about how important it is for men, in particular, to step up and step forward and make clear that violence against women is something that is not and cannot be tolerated, and that the most important thing -- or one of the most important things that we can do to try to end the scourge of violence against women is for men to ban together and to send a very clear signal that it is unacceptable for men to perpetrate acts of violence against women.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome any strong signals by anyone in this country in support of that value.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to ISIS.\xc2\xa0 To try to put a finer point on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked several times, rather than trying to confirm if he is going -- get ahead of the President of what he\xe2\x80\x99s specifically going to say, will he make decisions by Tuesday and Wednesday about expanding this campaign against ISIS so that he can present a plan first to the congressional leaders on Tuesday and then a plan, a strategy to the American people on Wednesday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to foreshadow any specific presidential decisions, but the President is interested in having a genuine consultation with the congressional leaders who will be here tomorrow about what he believes is the best path forward for confronting the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The President is interested in having a conversation with the American public about what sort of tools are at the disposal of the United States of America to confront this threat. Those tools include intelligence tools.\xc2\xa0 Those tools include the powerful diplomacy of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 Those tools also include the potent arsenal of the United States military.\xc2\xa0 And all of those things can be brought to bear to confront this situation.</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s most important for people to understand -- both the American people and for congressional leaders to understand -- is the President is steadfastly committed to ensuring that the United States is not taking this one alone.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to use all of the tools of our diplomacy to ensure that we have a central Iraqi government that\xe2\x80\x99s standing up and uniting that country to take the fight to ISIL in their own country; that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaging nations in the region, particularly the Sunni-led nations in the region who have a very clear stake in this outcome.\xc2\xa0 And the President spent a lot of time at the NATO Summit at the end of last week talking to our allies in NATO about what role the international community can play to support this broader effort to confront, degrade, and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple specifics.\xc2\xa0 A couple weeks ago, Peter asked you a question and you said the President was not referring to ISIS when he dismissed some terrorists in The New Yorker magazine as the JV squad.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post, I believe last week, gave you four Pinocchios for that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday went ahead -- glad you saw that -- the President yesterday went ahead and doubled down on it and said, I was not referring to ISIL, he said.\xc2\xa0 Why do you and the President continue to say something that has been proven to be false?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not proven to be false.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to go back to the -- I did this when Peter asked it, too, but let me just read what the President said.\xc2\xa0 The President was drawing distinction between core al Qaeda and a range of local groups.\xc2\xa0 What the President said is, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland, versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The point is the President was describing the wide variety of extremist groups that have sprouted up over the last several years in this region of the world.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have greater capabilities than others.\xc2\xa0 Some of them do not pose a threat to the homeland, or at least don\xe2\x80\x99t have the capacity to plan what the President described as \xe2\x80\x9cmajor terrorist plots against the homeland.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But David Remnick told PolitiFact -- the interview took place on January 7th -- that the President was referencing a specific event that had happened just days before -- January 3rd, when Islamic State raised this flag, took over Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 So in that interview, in that context, the President was referring to something -- I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re making this more general.\xc2\xa0 But according to David Remnick, was saying -- he was referring in the interview to something that specifically happened four days before -- Islamic State taking over Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 So that sounds like a direct -- whether he used the name ISIS/ISIL, he was referring to an event from four days before where Islamic State took over Fallujah.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, what the President was referring to was he was referring to jihadists who were engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.\xc2\xa0 The President was not singling out a specific group -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why he described jihadists, plural; power struggles, plural; disputes, plural.\xc2\xa0 He is talking about the wide variety of groups and indicating that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be worried about every single one of these groups.\xc2\xa0 Many of these groups aren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly sophisticated, don\xe2\x80\x99t have designs or the capability of attacking the United States homeland.\xc2\xa0 Some of them are more influential, some of them do have greater capacity, and some of them have built up and demonstrated that capacity over the last several months, like ISIL has.</p>\n<p>But the fact is, at the time what the President was talking about is drawing a clear distinction between core al Qaeda and the wide variety of groups that are extremist organizations that are operating in this area.\xc2\xa0 Even ISIL, which has demonstrated some substantial military capacity as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, there are not indications right now that they are actively planning or that they have the capacity to carry out a widespread conspiracy along the lines of the plot that was organized by Osama bin Laden about 13 years ago this week.\xc2\xa0 Their capacities are different, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the point that the President was trying to make.\xc2\xa0 It means that our policy for dealing with them needs to be different.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is putting in place a strategy to deal with the threat that is posed by ISIL before they can find the kind of safe haven that would allow them to eventually build the capacity to carry out the kind of terror attack that we saw that was carried out by Osama bin Laden.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Janet Napolitano, the President\xe2\x80\x99s former Homeland Security Secretary, said this morning that when she was in office, ISIS was on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s radar screen.\xc2\xa0 She left office a year ago this month -- September 2013.\xc2\xa0 So was ISIS on the President\xe2\x80\x99s radar screen at least a year ago?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why is he giving a big speech this week?\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t we get a strategy a year ago?\xc2\xa0 Six months ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is ISIS is essentially the inheritor of al Qaeda in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And these extremists have been wreaking havoc in this region of the world for a long time, so they\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly been on the radar screen of the national security professionals, national security leadership of this administration for five years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Janet Napolitano was right that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the radar screen --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They were also on the radar screen of the national security officials in the previous administration because there was concern about the threat that al Qaeda and Iraq posed to Americans in the region.</p>\n<p>Now, this is an organization that has evolved, but that essentially is where they evolved from.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the President has been focused on.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that the President is giving this speech now is that over the last couple of months we have seen this organization make substantial gains in Iraq and threaten Americans in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is that the Iraqi government -- the core reason for this is that the Iraqi government was governing along sectarian lines in a way that ruptured what had been a united country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so what we have been actively engaged in for quite some time at a diplomatic level is encouraging Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to unite that country behind a central government that demonstrates that they are committed to advancing the interests of every citizen of the nation of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a diverse country, and they need a central government that reflects that diversity and demonstrates a commitment to representing the interests of that diverse population.</p>\n<p>April.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Back on your talking point today -- buy-in and also partnerships -- would you say that if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying buy-in and partnerships you mean that executive -- well, the White House and Congress will either succeed or fail together, no matter what happens?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we would like to see is we would like to see Congress be united and to be a partner with this administration as we confront this threat -- for all the differences that I do not want to be in a position of papering over.\xc2\xa0 There are differences between Democrats and Republicans, particularly the Republicans on Capitol Hill, and the Democrats in the administration are substantial, that we have a difference of opinion about a range of things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But when it comes to protecting the American people and putting in place a strategy that makes good use of our intelligence capability, our diplomatic authority, and our military might, that we should be able to unite across partisan lines in support of that policy and in support of that strategy.\xc2\xa0 And we seek that kind of cooperation, consultation and partnership with everybody in Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even with uniting across party lines, no matter what happens, successes will be shared evenly and failures will be shared evenly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is undertaking this effort with the intention to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And the President is willing to share credit with those individuals in Congress who are going to partner with this administration to accomplish these goals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, in the ramp-up to 9/11, as we are looking to this next anniversary, there are concerns by many in the national security field that with the threats of ISIL that something could possibly happen here.\xc2\xa0 What is the mindset of this administration in the lead-up to 9/11?\xc2\xa0 And is there a possibility of increasing the threat level in this country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Decisions about increasing the threat level are made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, so you should consult with them about whether or not they are planning to increase the threat level.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not currently aware of any plans to increase the threat level.</p>\n<p>The second thing that\'s important for people to understand is the intelligence community continues to assess that there is no active plotting underway by ISIL for an attack against the homeland of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>The third thing I want to point out here is that we are concerned and remain concerned about the threat of violence that is posed by foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 And again, they\'re ironically named foreign fighters because we\xe2\x80\x99re principally talking about Americans with American passports who have traveled to Syria and taken up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And there is a threat that those individuals pose because they have an American passport.\xc2\xa0 They can freely travel back to the United States, and would therefore be in a position to potentially carry out acts of violence here in this country.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about and something that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring very closely.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re working with the international community to try to monitor the travel of those individuals so that we can try to limit the threat that they pose.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The concern of those several dozen Americans who have those passports back and forth to Syria, that doesn\'t make you think about increasing the threat level here at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly recalibrating our security posture here in this country to try to meet the threats that we perceive.\xc2\xa0 And some of the changes to that security architecture are perceptible and some of them aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But we are constantly making sure that we have in place a strategy for protecting American citizens and protecting the homeland.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a couple more.\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you have a handle on who all these foreign fighters are?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a number between 100 and 200, and that always kind of comes through other channels.\xc2\xa0 So what can the White House say specifically about how closely you are now able to track the foreign fighters?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The effort to monitor these foreign fighters is something that is the responsibility of the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult from this vantage point for me to spend a lot of time talking in detail about the actions of the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what I can tell you is the United States and this administration are very aware of the threat that is posed by these individuals.\xc2\xa0 We have been engaged in an effort both at a diplomatic level, at a law enforcement level, but also at an intelligence level to mitigate this threat.\xc2\xa0 And that means working closely with our partners in the region, but also with our allies in Western Europe.</p>\n<p>We talked a little bit earlier last week about how there are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an even larger number of so-called foreign fighters that have originated from Western Europe.\xc2\xa0 So the threat to these Western countries is, if you just look at the numbers, even larger than the threat that currently is facing the United States.</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work in united fashion, in coordinated fashion and united with our allies to confront this threat.\xc2\xa0 And I would also say something that I have been meaning to say for some time but haven\xe2\x80\x99t, which is that the President is actually going to convene a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss this issue and to talk about what sort of role the U.N. and our Security Council partners can play in trying to mitigate this threat that faces not just the United States, but to our allies and interests around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there a confidence that we generally know who all these people are at this point and where they are?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are significant resources that have been dedicated to this effort.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that I would be in a position to say a whole lot more about this, but other than to say we recognize the severity and the seriousness of this threat, and we have responded accordingly by putting in place the kinds of policies and procedures that we feel mitigate this threat.\xc2\xa0 But it remains something that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy\xe2\x80\x9d and then that a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy is being formed,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cintegrated strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d but then, \xe2\x80\x9cif it expands\xe2\x80\x9d and what role will everybody play.\xc2\xa0 So it seems like right now the strategy is to lay the groundwork for making those decisions, right?\xc2\xa0 Because whenever we hear an explanation of what the strategy is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of coalition building and putting something together to make those decisions in the future.\xc2\xa0 Is that how you would define the strategy right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would define the strategy in a couple of pretty clear ways.\xc2\xa0 The first priority, as the President has laid out, is supporting Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders as they form an inclusive government.\xc2\xa0 That inclusive government will be required to unite the country to face down the threat that is posed by ISIL and to take the fight to ISIL in their country.</p>\n<p>After all, we need to start from a place where the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people are responsible for the security of their own country.\xc2\xa0 The United States stands ready and will continue to support the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people as they try to secure their own country.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the first thing.</p>\n<p>The second thing is engaging regional governments.\xc2\xa0 And when I\xe2\x80\x99m saying regional governments, I\xe2\x80\x99m principally talking about these Sunni-led governments in the region.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who for two reasons should be involved.\xc2\xa0 The first is they can play an important role in coordinating with the Sunni tribes in western Iraq that can also take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The second is that they have a larger stake in this even than the United States does; that so many of these countries actually are threatened by Sunni extremists that are wreaking havoc in some cases on their border or very near it.\xc2\xa0 So they have an interest in committing to this broader effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>The third aspect of this strategy is engaging the international community, that there are resources that can be brought to bear by our NATO Allies and by other allies.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the U.K. and Australia and others commit military resources to providing some humanitarian relief to the religious and ethnic minorities that are being persecuted in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a tangible role for our allies to play.</p>\n<p>And, yes, there is a role to play for the United States military.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that that strategy for our military does not include sending combat troops on the ground into Iraq or to Syria.\xc2\xa0 But it does mean using the military might of the United States to coordinate with our allies in support of Iraqi and Peshmerga fighters that can take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So that is the strategy.</p>\n<p>And ultimately what -- let me finish with this just one last thing.\xc2\xa0 The thing that\'s important for people to understand is this is a different strategy than what was previously tried in Iraq, that previously the United States bore the overwhelming brunt of this commitment.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, what we learned is that the United States military -- for all its prowess, and for all of the bravery that was exhibited over the course of years by our servicemen and women -- cannot solve this problem for the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be up to the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government and Iraq security forces to secure their own country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the failure to learn that lesson would be a profound mistake.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that people pay more attention to what the military component of our strategy is than they do to the diplomatic element of our strategy.\xc2\xa0 But it is critically important that we ensure that the international community and that regional governments are invested in this effort so that the United States of America and our military are not bearing this weight alone.</p>\n<p>Do you have more, Michelle?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Okay, so all of this is groundwork-laying, basically.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine what the President is going to do on Wednesday besides lay all this out again.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it before.\xc2\xa0 So what are you expecting concretely then by the U.N. Security Council meeting from the coalition that\'s been formed?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a timeframe for some kind of progress on that?\xc2\xa0 Because for weeks now, it\xe2\x80\x99s been about building these coalitions.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the next kind of benchmark for seeing something from that coalition?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President spent a lot of time when he was at the NATO Summit talking to our allies in NATO about this issue.\xc2\xa0 The President also met with the Prime Minister and the incoming President of Turkey to discuss this issue, among other things.\xc2\xa0 He also talked to the King of Jordan about this issue.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State were there to participate in these conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we speak, the Secretary of Defense is in Turkey talking about some of these issues with his counterparts there.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of this week, the Secretary of State will be traveling to the region where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with his counterparts to talk about some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism advisor here at the White House, Lisa Monaco, is traveling to the region.\xc2\xa0 She was in Yemen and has trips to Saudi Arabia and at least one other country planned while she\xe2\x80\x99s in the region this week.\xc2\xa0 So these conversations are ongoing, and they will continue.</p>\n<p>You heard from the President himself on Friday indicate that he was encouraged by the reaction that he got from our partners and allies in the context of those conversations about their willingness to support a broader international effort to confront ISIL and degrade and ultimately destroy them.</p>\n<p>Sam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, two questions then.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a bit more about the tangible things you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from our international allies?\xc2\xa0 I know that they support in broad the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but have they committed any specific resources?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They have.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a long factsheet here that I won\xe2\x80\x99t read from because we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been here a while, but, yes, there are.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the first three, and they\'re in alphabetical order.\xc2\xa0 So Albania is first; they provided military equipment to the Kurds.\xc2\xa0 Australia participated in Mount Sinjar and Amerli airdrop operations.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve pledged $4.6 million to the U.N. to address some of this situation, and they agreed to accept 4,400 refugees from Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve also contributed significant airlift capacity and several planeloads of humanitarian assistance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you mind making that list public?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get that to you.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that nations like Canada, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s alphabetical order, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a long list.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99re running -- not much time.\xc2\xa0 Bill Nelson --you say you want congressional input here -- Bill Nelson, a senator, is actually introducing a bill that would authorize airstrikes in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House would/could support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen his legislative proposal, but I am confident that somebody here in the administration will be in touch with him about his proposal.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly interested, like I said, in getting some buy-in from Congress and are open to considering the kinds of things that they want to move forward to demonstrate the kind of partnership that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see between the administration and Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last housekeeping item.\xc2\xa0 Has the President actually seen or heard the Ray Rice video?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s an avid sports fan, and this is something that has been covered extensively in sports journalism, so I do know that the President is aware of the situation as it relates to the Ravens\xe2\x80\x99 running back.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen the video that was just released in the last 12 hours or so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the Hawks email?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, he\xe2\x80\x99s a big NBA fan.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the story, but I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen the email.</p>\n<p>So thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll come back tomorrow.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:59 P.M.
