EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started with questions I just wanted to give you a readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President called the Israeli Prime Minister today to convey his best wishes before the start of Passover.\xc2\xa0 Noting that he would host a seder at the White House, the President recalled that the story of Passover is one of liberation and freedom, and expressed hope that the Israeli people would be able to celebrate in peace.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders also discussed U.S.-Israeli cooperation on counterterrorism, how best to move forward in efforts to advance Middle East peace, and the recent violence near the Gaza Strip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPrime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep appreciation for U.S. funding for the Iron Dome rocket and mortar defense system, which he noted has successfully intercepted several rockets aimed at Israeli communities.\xc2\xa0 The President congratulated the Prime Minister on his impressive -- on this impressive Israeli technological achievement and expressed his pride that Israel-American cooperation made it possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith the signing of the fiscal year 2011 budget appropriation, the President approved $205 million in U.S. funding for Iron Dome, which is above the annual package of foreign military financing for Israel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President and the Prime Minister agreed to stay in close touch on the range of issues facing the United States and Israel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat is all I have to start this day, and I\'ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 Standard and Poor\xe2\x80\x99s downgraded its rating on U.S. long-term debt to negative and cited a material risk that Washington won\'t be able to get a deal to confront and address these deficits in the coming years, and then the stock market took a plunge.\xc2\xa0 Just to start with, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that kind of bond rating?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the bond rating remained the same.\xc2\xa0 The S&amp;P affirmed the AAA bond rating of the United States, but emphasized the importance of timely bipartisan cooperation and action on fiscal reform -- the same emphasis the President made when he gave his speech last Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 What the S&amp;P analysis also said was that the American economy is strong, it\xe2\x80\x99s growing, it\xe2\x80\x99s diversified, it\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic, it continues to be the most important and most powerful economy in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for its political analysis, we simply believe that the prospects are better.\xc2\xa0 We think the political process will outperform S&amp;P expectations.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed, as he made clear in his speech on Wednesday, to moving forward in a bipartisan way to reach common ground on this important issue of fiscal reform.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that the fact that Republicans -- that he and the Republicans agree on a target -- $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 to 12 years -- is an enormously positive development.\xc2\xa0 They also agree that the problem exists.\xc2\xa0 So the third part is the hard part, which is reaching a bipartisan agreement.\xc2\xa0 But two out of three is important.\xc2\xa0 And it demonstrates progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, a statement that observes the fact that there is often gridlock in Washington and that the contentiousness between the two parties sometimes prevents us from getting things done is not one we would disagree with.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is when the issues are important, history shows that both sides can come together and get things done.\xc2\xa0 President Ronald Reagan did that with Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, Democratic Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 President Bill Clinton did it with Newt Gingrich, Republican Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 President Obama did it 10 days ago with John Boehner, Republican Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 We can do it again.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s possible and that it will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I understand your point there that the White House thinks that Washington will outperform this outlook, but I just want to make sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 When the agency lowers the outlook on the long-term debt to negative, is it your view that\xc2\xa0 -- what is your view about the significance of that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We think a reminder that it is important that we reach agreement on fiscal reform is always valuable, and that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially what it is.\xc2\xa0 It is another indication on the\xc2\xa0 -- of the importance of both sides coming together and grappling with this problem and getting to a resolution.\xc2\xa0 Again, Republicans and Democrats, the President, all agree that there is a problem, that we need to do something about reducing our deficit.\xc2\xa0 Everyone agrees now on a target for deficit reduction\xc2\xa0 -- $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years.\xc2\xa0 That\'s significant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I would point you to Moody\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.\xc2\xa0 In the wake of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech on Wednesday, Moody gave a very -- Moody\xe2\x80\x99s gave a very positive assessment, and again today in its weekly report, made another positive assessment.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that both sides have the same or similar target, that they diagnose the problem similarly, and that the President has begun a process that he hopes will lead to bipartisan negotiations and lead to some sort of bipartisan agreement I think is all an indication of the seriousness with which he takes this issue and the importance that he places on moving forward and addressing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick topic, please.\xc2\xa0 On the severe weather down in the South, as you know, dozens of people have been killed over the last few days by tornadoes across the South.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans to go to the region and talk to victims and inspect the damage?\xc2\xa0 As you know, that\'s often the role that Presidents play.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- I don\'t have a scheduling update.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with Governor Perdue and Governor Bentley yesterday to express his condolences and make sure they knew that the federal government stands ready through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist in the recovery efforts if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFEMA, through its regional office in Atlanta, Georgia, is closely monitoring conditions following the severe storms.\xc2\xa0 It has dispatched preliminary damage assessment teams to North Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, and we have folks on the ground assessing the situation and standing ready to provide assistance as necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staying with S&amp;P, does the warning on the direction and the outlook for the long-term debt rating make a deal over the deficit more urgent?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that any call for a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction on fiscal reform is a welcome one, and in that context, I think that it adds to what we believe is some momentum towards that end.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut again, I would point to some important factors here, that even in S&amp;P\xe2\x80\x99s analysis on the U.S. economy it said:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe economy of the United States is flexible and highly diversified. The country\xe2\x80\x99s effective monetary policies have supported output growth while containing inflationary pressures.\xc2\xa0 And a consistent global preference for the U.S. dollar over all other currencies gives the country unique external liquidity.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt goes on with:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cOur ratings on the U.S. rest on its high income, highly diversified and flexible economy, backed by a strong track record of prudent and credible monetary policy.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot here that describes the strength of the United States economy, the strength of our recovery.\xc2\xa0 And on the political question of whether achieving compromise is within reach, we believe it is, and we rest our faith in those prospects on historical precedent that is as fresh as the recent agreement between the Speaker of the House and the President and other leaders on the fiscal year 2011 budget, and on the seriousness with which this President and other serious parties are approaching this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any other concrete evidence, apart from the deal over the government shutdown?\xc2\xa0 I mean, their analysis is based on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I would say the fact that they share the $4 trillion target, they share an analysis of the problem and the fact that it needs to be addressed, and these are important steps toward a deal.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that it is recognized as an important matter adds to the momentum, we believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there is some legitimate sentiment on the Hill that the talks on deficit reform that the President called for last week have really undermined the work that the Gang of Six has been doing, working on for months.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re just a few weeks from -- away from releasing their own plan.\xc2\xa0 Why not wait for them, or why not include them more in the talks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President has said and others have said that we wholly endorse the fact that serious-minded lawmakers of both parties in that group and others have taken on this issue and approached it in a way that recognizes the importance of getting something done and the need to do it in a balanced way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe fact that the President has come out with his vision should be a positive reinforcement, another indication that this is important work that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the President built his vision by borrowing in many ways from the recommendations of the bipartisan commission on which a number of members of that Senate group sat, and that he has been -- his approach has been praised by people, independents, in this field, if you will, of fiscal reform -- like Pete Peterson and David Walker -- gives a good sign, a good indication, of the fact that there is a building consensus around the way to approach this problem.\xc2\xa0 So he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s very complementary to the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So creating another group you don\'t think undermines what --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the reality is that for anything to pass Congress you need 60 votes in the Senate and 218 votes in the House.\xc2\xa0 So we need to build off of all the existing groups, if you will.\xc2\xa0 We need to bring together through a process that has to involve the leadership those Republicans and Democrats who can find consensus on common ground on measures to reduce our deficit and begin to reform our fiscal policy in a way that makes us stronger for the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And President Obama is hitting the road this week.\xc2\xa0 What is his message for the American people and how is it different from his speech last week?\xc2\xa0 And what do you guys intend to get from the Facebook --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The message he\xe2\x80\x99s carrying to Virginia tomorrow, to California Wednesday, to Nevada on Thursday, is very much the message that he laid out on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 And you can\'t just say these things once, you need -- he very much looks forward to engaging with Americans outside of Washington to talk about how we got here, why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to deal with the need for fiscal reform, and what his vision is for getting there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis can be extremely arcane and esoteric stuff, when Americans out there are worrying principally about the economy and job creation and gas prices, and he wants to explain why, for the sake of our economy, we need to move forward on fiscal reform, share responsibility and share the burden as we go forward to create an America that is stronger and creating more jobs in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple things.\xc2\xa0 On the S&amp;P, Majority Leader Cantor just put out a statement calling it a wakeup call -- it seems to agree with what you\'re saying -- but also said that as a wakeup call, House Republicans will only move forward on the President\xe2\x80\x99s request to increase the debt limit if it\xe2\x80\x99s accompanied by serious reforms that immediately reduce federal spending.\xc2\xa0 The Majority Leader being pretty clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re standing firm on their position of more spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Is that at this point something the President can agree to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President very much, as he laid out in his speech on Wednesday, believes that part of the package in terms of long-term fiscal reform involves spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 It also involves reductions -- savings in health care spending.\xc2\xa0 It involves savings in the tax code.\xc2\xa0 It involves savings in Pentagon spending, as well as, of course, interest payments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo what I would point you to are the statements that the Secretary of the Treasury made over the weekend where he made very clear -- and he was in the room for a number of these meetings -- that what is reassuring and important is that the leaders of both parties in Congress as well as the President, of course, agree that the debt ceiling will be raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBecause we cannot play chicken with our economy.\xc2\xa0 We cannot play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 We meet our obligations -- we are the United States. And we will do that.\xc2\xa0 That will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tConcurrently, we, as the President urged, will be engaged in bipartisan negotiations aimed at reducing our deficit, cutting spending, and taking other measures to reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 Those things can happen on parallel tracks, if you will.\xc2\xa0 But regardless of how that process proceeds and what agreements are reached along the way and in what timeframe, it is absolutely a fact that Congress will raise the debt ceiling because not to do that would be a catastrophic folly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on Friday the President issued a signing statement that -- a lot of people have been talking about it.\xc2\xa0 On the campaign, during the campaign, he said in several different venues that signing statements were a bad idea, and at one point he said we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to use signing statements to do an end-run around Congress.\xc2\xa0 So why going -- why the change in position now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me make very clear what the President -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, what -- the position he took during the campaign, because it\xe2\x80\x99s been a little bit misunderstood, although most of the folks who reported on this over the weekend got it right.\xc2\xa0 He never said he was opposed entirely to signing statements.\xc2\xa0 I can point you to numerous statements from the campaign where he made clear that every President should retain the right, of course must retain the right, to have signing statements, to raise constitutional concerns and objections with a law passed by Congress that he signed into law.\xc2\xa0 His concern was with what he saw as an abuse of the signing statement by the previous administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the positions he took in the signing statements on the budget bill are entirely consistent with that position.\xc2\xa0 You need to retain the right to, as President, to be able to issue those signing statements, but obviously they should not be abused.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did that position evolve, would you say, over time?\xc2\xa0 Because it was pretty clear at a couple venues when asked about them, he said, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t sign --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have them with me -- no, actually on numerous occasions, including a question-and-answer session with Charlie Savage, who was with The Boston Globe at the time and did a lot of work on this issue, made very clear, explicitly, that signing statements needed to be retained.\xc2\xa0 They just should not and he would not abuse them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the tax -- does the administration have any more specific recommendations for reforming the tax code?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Any more specific today?\xc2\xa0 No, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun a -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun a process.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, is committed to both individual tax reform as well as corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 He believes that a simpler tax code is good for individual filers and it\xe2\x80\x99s good for business because it makes business more efficient.\xc2\xa0 So those are two goals that he thinks are very important.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any new proposals for you today, Mr. Plante.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Tax Policy Institute says that 45 percent of Americans don\'t pay any income tax.\xc2\xa0 Many of them are lower-income people.\xc2\xa0 But does that mean they don\'t have a stake in the system?\xc2\xa0 Should they pay something?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, there are many taxes besides income taxes, as you know, and most people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I said income tax.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I know you did, but to say that they don\'t have a stake in the system, of course, they\xe2\x80\x99re all Americans, and those who are paying payroll taxes are working Americans.\xc2\xa0 They very much have a stake in the system, and they very much have a stake in the economic future of this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd for those who are out of work, they very much have a stake in this process, which must not as we go forward take actions that undermine the recovery that\'s underway or that undermine the job creation that\'s underway.\xc2\xa0 That is paramount here and is -- the focus the President wakes up with every morning is:\xc2\xa0 What can I do to continue job creation?\xc2\xa0 What can I do to continue the growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as we emerge from this terrible recession that we\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered from?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo everybody has a stake in this.\xc2\xa0 And everybody has a stake in Congress and the President reaching agreement on economic policy issues that allows for the economy to continue to grow, for jobs to continue to be created, for industries to thrive in this country that can create jobs in this country.\xc2\xa0 And those are the policies that the President feels more passionately about and pursues every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, walk me through what happens if the nation bumps up against this debt ceiling and how that is fundamentally different than us lacking budget authority, for example?\xc2\xa0 What makes it so catastrophically more serious?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because we have the largest economy in the world, the most important economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 The world looks to us for economic stability.\xc2\xa0 The world obviously takes -- has a great deal of faith in our currency and in U.S. treasuries.\xc2\xa0 And a failure to meet our obligations would be a grave mistake that would have a grave impact on both the American economy and the global economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou don\'t have to look to me for an analysis of this.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of credible economists who can provide it for you independent of the White House, the Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I think the consensus is near universal that the impact would be very negative and very severe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What happens, though?\xc2\xa0 Does it mean we\xe2\x80\x99re not paying the interest on treasuries to institutions or individuals that own them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe what happens -- and at the end of this answer, I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to the experts at Treasury for this\xc2\xa0 -- but I believe what happens is that we have bills come due that we can\xe2\x80\x99t pay because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t raised the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So, to put it in very plain language, we would default.\xc2\xa0 And default is a terrible thing for an individual; it is a catastrophic thing for the United States of America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to me about this aid to an anti-Syrian government broadcast group, I guess, that was revealed in Wikileaks last week?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some reporting that administration officials are concerned that people who participate in this could be targeted by the Syrian government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, you know we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to comment on alleged leaks of classified material.\xc2\xa0 As you know also, the U.S. government provides support to civil society, democracy and human rights activists around the world in line with our values, among them respecting the fundamental human rights of free speech, peaceful assembly and human dignity.\xc2\xa0 U.S. outreach to Syrian civilian society is entirely consistent with those principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAthena.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two subjects.\xc2\xa0 On the debt limit, I want to make sure I understand the reason for sort of drawing a line in the sand or talking about how important it is to have a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 Is it a philosophical reason, or a practical one?\xc2\xa0 Are you worried that you -- you have to have it on two parallel tracks because if you try and lay out the debt limit bill, you\xe2\x80\x99ll slow it down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me make clear, the cleanliness of this bill is not the issue.\xc2\xa0 I think we went through this a little bit when we were talking about the 2011 budget negotiations and riders, for example.\xc2\xa0 And the issue here is -- again, you could have an attachment to this that declared my favorite baseball team America\xe2\x80\x99s baseball team, if you will.\xc2\xa0 That would be fine with me, maybe not everybody, but it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe problem -- the issue here is the debt ceiling has to be raised, and it cannot be held hostage to a process that is very complicated and difficult.\xc2\xa0 Now, we may reach -- we hope we will reach an agreement on deficit reduction, a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction within the timeframe; we believe that\'s possible.\xc2\xa0 However, I think what the Secretary of Treasury made clear over the weekend is that we cannot make it conditional.\xc2\xa0 Because what if we don\'t?\xc2\xa0 These are hard things.\xc2\xa0 What if we don\'t?\xc2\xa0 What if we\xe2\x80\x99re a week away or two weeks away and in the meantime, Congress says, well, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to raise the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 And even getting up to that deadline poses huge problems for the economy because the global economy begins the possibility of the impossible, the unthinkable, which is a U.S.\xc2\xa0 default.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the point is we have to separate the two in the sense that we can make serious progress with great commitment on deficit reduction, but we must within a time certain raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Because in many ways not to do so would render all our other efforts pointless because we would immediately arrest the recovery.\xc2\xa0 We could very potentially cause a global economic problem, and that would make everything else we need to do so much harder.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re coming up on a year anniversary since the Deepwater Horizon accident and the subsequent oil spill, which we all know what the effects of that were.\xc2\xa0 How confident is the administration now that that sort of incident could be avoided?\xc2\xa0 And what more needs to be done or is still being done to get to the point where you can be confident?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is an excellent question because we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed a lot even since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been Press Secretary about the process of granting new leases for offshore oil drilling in deepwater.\xc2\xa0 And what happened after this historically serious oil spill was that the administration -- this administration insisted that before we grant permits for more deepwater drilling that industry demonstrate its capacity to contain a spill like the one we saw in the Gulf.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe first permit after that was demonstrated by the first company or consortium of companies which was granted in February. We have now granted 10 deepwater, offshore oil permits, and we will continue to do that because we believe it is of paramount importance that we continue to drill, but we drill safely.\xc2\xa0 We need to obviously maintain and, when possible, increase our domestic oil production, but we need to do it in a safe way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, as you just said, that long ago that we were witnessing this terrible oil spill, and we should not forget that it is important to take the measures necessary, as this administration has through the Department of Interior, to make sure that the industries that want to drill -- and we want them to drill -- that they do it in a safe way, and they have the capacity to deal with the kind of spill we saw.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are confident that you could -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen again?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are confident that the procedures are in place.\xc2\xa0 And as the Secretary of State -- the Secretary of the Interior rather, said over the weekend, we obviously know there\xe2\x80\x99s more to be done and we are constantly in the process of improving the agency that oversees this process.\xc2\xa0 But on the issue of are we able, will industry be able to contain a spill if the kind of spill happened that happened last year, we believe that we are only issuing permits to those companies that demonstrate that capacity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I get back to you, Sam?\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did the White House learn that S&amp;P was going to make the announcement that it made this morning?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Friday afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And did anyone try to talk them out of what they were going to say?\xc2\xa0 Or what were those discussions like?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the discussions were like.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was -- they obviously have a process and they issue the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who did they raise --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe the Treasury Department, but you may ask them for more details about the conversations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction when he learned that this was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the reaction of all of us is that the assessment of the state of the U.S. economy is one we agree with.\xc2\xa0 The assessment of the potential for a bipartisan agreement is, we think, not as positive as we believe it is, and that -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why I say that we believe the process will outperform S&amp;P expectations on the political side of this, which, we obviously have a certain amount of experience here just in these last two-plus years in dealing with Congress, and in the last several months in dealing with a divided Congress and still getting things done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd there is great historical precedence for that to happen. When you can look and hear the competing statements from members of both parties and think there is no way these two sides are going to find common ground and come together -- and yet there is a way because the American people demand it and the American economy demands it.\xc2\xa0 We need to address this issue.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President takes it so seriously.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that there are a lot of serious lawmakers up on Capitol Hill who agree that we need to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo in many ways, as hard as this issue is, because of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through in the economy and because of the fine work of the commission, the President\xe2\x80\x99s commission, there is an atmosphere, if you will, that creates potential for agreement that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in the past.\xc2\xa0 And we hope to capitalize on that and get something done for the American people.\xc2\xa0 We may not agree on every item, but there is much we can agree on that we think will be good for the economy and good for our balance sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the interviews the President is doing this afternoon, can you tell us the criteria that\xe2\x80\x99s used to select the stations that get the exclusives?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we -- I mean, we do a lot of these, as you know, Mark.\xc2\xa0 I think we look at different states, different markets, where the President wants to carry his message.\xc2\xa0 And this is a continuing process.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure by the time my time is done here we will have hit a vast array of regional TV markets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the campaign weigh in on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The campaign doesn\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in on it.\xc2\xa0 We make our -- we make our decisions about where the President give interviews here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that the campaign -- I think that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign -- did not exist but for a few -- until a few days ago, or a number of days ago.\xc2\xa0 So it is not -- the process is pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 We look at where he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken before, where the market is, and proceed from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think he gets better access to the American people than doing a news conference here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we believe, and he shares our belief, that there are many ways to speak to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And it would be nice, it would make our jobs a lot easier, if these were the days when a vast majority of the American audience tuned into Walter Cronkite at night and we could just talk to \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Walter\xe2\x80\x9d and get our message out there, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case anymore, as you well know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so we reach out in numerous ways -- through national media interviews, through national White House press conferences, through regional media interviews, through Facebook town halls, which we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this week, which we are greatly looking forward to.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s a mix of traditional media, new media, national media, regional media and -- because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to reach Americans where they are.\xc2\xa0 And it just remains the case that a lot of Americans still get a large amount of their news from local television.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Did the President actually get briefed himself on the S&amp;P report?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not know specifically if he got briefed himself.\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he had a broad briefing on it, but he is aware of it.*<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he use that report in any way in the town halls tomorrow and Wednesday and Thursday to make his points?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to anticipate because these are town halls where people are asking him questions, but it certainly -- he certainly stands ready to answer a question that makes a reference to that report.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when the S&amp;P said that there was a material risk on long-term debt, does the White House agree or disagree with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact that there is a long-term debt issue that we must confront as a nation is precisely why the President and other serious-minded people in Washington, lawmakers on Capitol Hill, have come forward with their visions of how to address it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so, again, if the assessment is that we have a problem, we agree.\xc2\xa0 If the assessment is that we need to reach a bipartisan agreement to address that problem, we agree with that. And where we slightly disagree is that we think the prospects for bipartisan agreement remain high, because it is at moments like these when the leaders of this country come together and in a bipartisan way find common ground and do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the country.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it already, this President has, and we think we can do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMara.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the things that administration officials have warned about in terms of the urgency of the debt ceiling is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much that the markets would react in a catastrophic way after, heaven forbid, you don\xe2\x80\x99t raise the debt ceiling, but that they could start weighing in before if they don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be done, which is what this seems to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which is why it\xe2\x80\x99s so reassuring, Mara, that the leaders of both houses in Congress of both parties have said the debt ceiling will be raised.\xc2\xa0 They have said -- as you know, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, we can stipulate that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- read some of the quotes back, that -- and we believe they -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing they said in their meeting with the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact that after the President gives this major speech the markets -- S&amp;P and now the markets seem to have taken the exact opposite takeaway, in other words, that they\xe2\x80\x99re pessimistic instead of optimistic about the two sides coming together.\xc2\xa0 And they get a unique vote -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait until election -- markets don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait until Election Day to vote.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you think their pessimism could affect not just the economy and the stock market going down, but could affect -- make it harder for you to achieve the outcome that you want.\xc2\xa0 And this is a real factor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- let me parse -- let me split some of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying here.\xc2\xa0 One is, is it a problem -- would it be a problem if the markets, prior to the deadline for raising the debt ceiling, believed that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secretary of Treasury has said that. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important not just to raise the debt --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think that\'s a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- today\xe2\x80\x99s report was about a prospect for deficit reduction, okay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but -- yes, okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to move and to move sooner rather than later, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the instability caused by any doubt about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that they do it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that the leaders have said they will do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTwo, you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked a lot about this one piece of analysis.\xc2\xa0 But again, I point you to a lot of others out there -- Pete Peterson, David Walker, Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson, others who have -- outside people who have made very positive statements about the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech and the prospects for bipartisan compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI would also point you to Moody\xe2\x80\x99s:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThis potential change in the direction\xe2\x80\x9d -- this is in the wake of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech -- \xe2\x80\x9cThis potential change in the direction of fiscal policy is credit positive for the U.S. federal government, although it remains uncertain what sort of budget will actually be adopted.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Credit positive, so that is a positive assessment on the future as a result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech on Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cDespite these uncertainties, we view the changed parameters of the debate with broadly similar goals as to government debt levels as a turning point that is positive for the long-term fiscal position of the U.S. federal government.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That is Moody\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 That\'s Moody\xe2\x80\x99s assessment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, look, this is hard stuff, complicated stuff.\xc2\xa0 It requires some elbow grease by members of both the Republican and Democratic parties to get these kinds of agreements done, but we think there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to believe we can do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think S&amp;P matters more to the markets than Moody\xe2\x80\x99s?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a market analyst.\xc2\xa0 And we believe in the strength of the U.S. economy, the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re growing out of the recession and creating jobs, and that there is a focus by this President and members of Congress on the need to deal with our long-term debt and deficit issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what is the President doing, if anything, to spur Congress, the congressional leaders, to name the members of the debt reduction group that he called for in his speech?\xc2\xa0 The Republicans haven\xe2\x80\x99t named anyone.\xc2\xa0 The Democratic leaders have each named two instead of four, as he proposed.\xc2\xa0 And the two that Senator Reid proposed are not exactly people you associate with trying to reduce the debt.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Baucus is actively opposed to even talking about doing anything on Social Security\xe2\x80\x99s long-term finances.\xc2\xa0 I mean, why do we have any grounds to believe this is ever going to get off the ground?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because it has to.\xc2\xa0 Because it has to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President doing about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are obviously -- Congress, as you know, is on recess, but we are, at staff level, having conversations, and the phones work around the world, so we\xe2\x80\x99re also having conversations with lawmakers who are in various places around the world about the need to move forward with this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd we remain confident that we can do that and we will do that because it\xe2\x80\x99s essential.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essential that the American people see that its elected leaders in Washington are addressing an important problem together.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s essential for them to see that the serious members of both parties acknowledge that in any situation like this, just as it was true with the fiscal year 2011 budget negotiations, neither side is going to get 100 percent of what it wants.\xc2\xa0 There is not -- a \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or the highway approach\xe2\x80\x9d is not credible.\xc2\xa0 And so the President understands that, and we believe that everybody needs to understand that.\xc2\xa0 And then that will help -- that recognition will also help the process move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President had conversations since his speech last Wednesday with either Speaker Boehner or Senator McConnell about naming --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there have been conversations at the staff level.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe the President has had conversations with any of the leaders you mentioned in the last several days, but we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one question --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what, let me go to Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one -- just one.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my turn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 Ann Compton, from ABC.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on what Jackie asked.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have any conversation with the Speaker before he went to Iraq and to Pakistan to make sure the United States is speaking with one voice overseas?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know if that\'s -- if they spoke about his trip to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 They obviously spoke in the wake of the agreement on the budget a week ago Friday.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that the Speaker of the House visited Iraq to see the progress that\'s been made there and the fact that our civilian and military personnel continue to do extraordinary work there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA lot of people have taken their eye off that ball, understandably, because we have drawn down -- this President has drawn down 100,000 American troops from Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And we are very much in a process of making transition -- full transition to the Iraqis, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a support and assist mode there for a long time now, as you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker announced in a letter this morning that he would like to take money away from the Justice Department and give it to the House to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, something that he says, now that Justice has announced that it will not defend it, that the money it would have otherwise spent should go to the House to hire outside legal counsel so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add to any additional government spending.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any comment specifically on funding.\xc2\xa0 I do know that from the day that we announced this here and I spoke about it, that we obviously will work with Congress if Congress so chooses to move forward and want to defend it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- pay for it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would address that to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the question, the issue of funding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re moving from a high-stakes, high-drama dispute over spending that almost led to a government shutdown to another high-stakes, high-drama dispute over raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult political environment.\xc2\xa0 Is there space for the President to advance a positive agenda here on jobs and the environment?\xc2\xa0 Does he see the next two years as playing defense?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we have learned since the midterm elections that delivered the House of Representatives to the Republicans is that despite prognostications to the contrary, we can get big things done.\xc2\xa0 We can get important things done.\xc2\xa0 So this President believes very strongly that, yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a potential for serious work to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily going to be easy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to require compromise by both sides.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a divided government.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s how our system works, and he remains confident.\xc2\xa0 And I would just note a couple of things -- that he spent a lot of time going out not just from Washington but around the country talking about his energy policy and the need to diversify our energy sources and to pursue a clean energy standard and address very directly the problems that Americans are contending with because of the rise in oil prices.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd he believes that he can continue to talk about those issues and make progress on those issues because the American people expect us to.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t really care -- they don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s an excuse that one party controls the House and another party controls the Senate, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s party isn\xe2\x80\x99t in control.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not an excuse to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it is.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he began a process on Wednesday that explicitly calls for bipartisan agreement because that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re here to do, is to get some work done for the American people<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s timeline for dealing with the group is targeted for the end of June.\xc2\xa0 The deadline -- expected deadline for the debt limit to be increased is -- of course, could be between mid May and late July.\xc2\xa0 What happens if the debt limit -- if Treasury says we need that May 15th and negotiations are ongoing and you\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position yet to put forward a package?\xc2\xa0 What -- is there -- that seems to be another kind of game of chicken.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s expectation in terms of what will happen if the two parallel tracks don\xe2\x80\x99t proceed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the big -- well, the Treasury Department has made very clear what the -- in its letters to Congress from the Secretary of the Treasury and in other ways about what the chronology looks like.\xc2\xa0 And I would leave it to them to analyze what those deadlines are and to provide that information to Congress, which they have done and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will continue to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut it does -- your question goes right to my earlier point, and right to the statements that Secretary Geithner made yesterday, which is we are pursuing deficit reduction aggressively at the same time -- and within the same timeframe that Congress needs to take action on raising the debt ceiling.<br/>\n\tIt would be a mistake to have one be conditional upon the other precisely for the reasons that you mention, that -- agreement is hard.\xc2\xa0 We believe an agreement is possible by the end of June, and that that will be a positive thing in and of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- what we have said is that you cannot play chicken with the economy.\xc2\xa0 You cannot play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 And to make raising the debt ceiling contingent upon the success of those negotiations is very risky behavior.\xc2\xa0 It is playing chicken, and we don\'t think that that\'s what congressional leaders meant when they reassured the President and they reassured the public that the debt ceiling would be raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you would expect them -- the House and the Senate to just do the debt limit on the promise of this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I take them at their word that the debt ceiling will and must be raised, and more importantly, the President takes them at their word.\xc2\xa0 But let me remind you that we are cognizant of -- we acknowledge what members of Congress are saying and how they want to see progress on deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And so do we, which is why we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to this process.\xc2\xa0 And we will push that boulder up the hill because it\xe2\x80\x99s important, and we will demonstrate, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject.\xc2\xa0 You say you can\xe2\x80\x99t play chicken with the economy, but the economy right now is directly tied to prices at the pump.\xc2\xa0 When is the President -- or what conversations have been happening right now about tapping into the Strategic Oil Reserve?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President gave a major speech talking about gas prices.\xc2\xa0 And he spoke in a press conference about this, and he has taken questions in the past about the SPRO, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\xc2\xa0 We obviously look at the situation constantly and assess what our options are.<br/>\n\tThe SPRO exists to deal with a literal disruption in the supply of oil.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the President said recently in one of his interviews that you have to be very careful about the decisions you make with regard to releasing the reserve because you don\'t want to get in the situation where you release it because of a price issue, and then find that you have disruption and your reserves are down.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a very serious decision to take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHowever, he remains -- he obviously continues to look at it. The point he has made in his energy speech and his statements about our need to address our long-term energy future is that there are no short-term fixes to this problem, and it is -- that are sustainable or dramatic because -- and this is what he addressed and talked about before, that we had a spike in 2008.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people said a lot of things in Washington about the need to deal with gas prices.\xc2\xa0 And then prices went back down and everybody forgot about it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you need a long-term energy policy that reduces our dependence on foreign oil, increases our production both of fossil fuels and forms of clean energy, diversifies our energy sources, and does it in a way that protects us in the future against these same kinds of price shocks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up.\xc2\xa0 So let me understand if I\xe2\x80\x99m understanding you correctly.\xc2\xa0 If the President were to think about tapping the petroleum reserve, if he did that it would not make a significant difference to the American pocketbook?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that there are no short-term solutions to our overall problem with dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 You have to have a sustained energy policy and you have to look at diversifying your sources of energy, increasing your production of energy of all kinds, and building clean energy technologies that allow us to move -- again, move off of our dependence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing $4 a gallon at many pumps across the nation, is this White House bracing for $5 a gallon and higher starting this summer?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would not predict -- any more than I can become a market analyst be an oil market analyst.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is this -- again, it is a conversation we have every day here about gas prices and the impact they have on Americans.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that is the conversation that Americans are having around the country.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about deficits and debts.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about a lot of things.\xc2\xa0 But, far more, they\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about the S&amp;P analysis today -- they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the price at the pump down the street and the impact it\xe2\x80\x99s having on their wallets, which is why the President is so committed to coming up with a long-term solution and not just trying to win the rhetorical debate about the problem of gas prices.\xc2\xa0 He wants a policy that positions America in the future in a way that reduces the impact of these kind of price hikes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without quantifying that, is this White House bracing for higher prices?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not predicting higher or lower.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not in that business.\xc2\xa0 What we know is that prices are high and that severely tests Americans.\xc2\xa0 We are grateful that Congress and we were able to reach the tax cut agreement in December that provided a payroll tax cut for everybody that has helped alleviate the impact of the rising gas prices.\xc2\xa0 But we are very cognizant of it.\xc2\xa0 We think about it and talk about it every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just do one more.\xc2\xa0 Keith.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya, there are reports that NATO Europe is running out of munitions to fight the war.\xc2\xa0 Is there any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, reports of what?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That NATO Europe, the European allies of NATO who are in this front seat of this war, are running out of munitions to drop on Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces.\xc2\xa0 Is there any -- and apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s some pressure for the United States to take up a larger role again.\xc2\xa0 Is there any consideration of that now at the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe that NATO has the capability and the capacity to fulfill the mission it has, taking the lead and command and control in enforcing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973.\xc2\xa0 We have -- our role is as the President promised it would be, which is support and assist, and it remains an important role but not a lead role.\xc2\xa0 We provide capacities for jamming, for tanker refueling, for intelligence gathering and the like, and we continue to work with our NATO partners to find if there are other ways that we can assist.\xc2\xa0 But we are not -- we have no plans to change our posture.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe have a great deal of faith in NATO\xe2\x80\x99s ability to fulfill its mission.\xc2\xa0 And I would point to you that as -- in the last 24 hours have been -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a dramatic increase in the number of sorties flown by NATO planes as the weather has cleared, and again, demonstrates the capacity of NATO to fulfill its mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the report wrong then?\xc2\xa0 Does NATO -- do the European allies have enough munitions to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- again, I would address those questions to NATO.\xc2\xa0 We remain fully confident in NATO\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, but you said you\xe2\x80\x99d take it after.\xc2\xa0 You said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, wait.\xc2\xa0 You know what, I did -- well, I said I would take Sam\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember Victoria, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 One more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I never said yours, Lester.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You never said -- in other words, I\'m not going to be allowed to ask any questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered your questions many times.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Jay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to a lot of -- with the year anniversary of the BP spill, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about ensuring that similar mishaps don\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 But one of the key domestic legislative priorities for this administration is lifting the cap on economic damages.\xc2\xa0 From $75 million I think you got all the way to unlimited.\xc2\xa0 It started at $10 billion and I think it went further from there.\xc2\xa0 There is no movement on that in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 How can you be comfortable with more drilling in the Gulf when there still is a cap on economic damages at $75 million should a spill actually take place?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Sam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specifics on the issue of the cap on damages.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that, as I said earlier, that the administration is committed and focused on making sure that, as it has in recent weeks begun issuing permits, new permits for deepwater drilling, that it only does so when an industry demonstrates the capacity to deal with these kinds of spills, so that what happened in the Gulf last year does not happen again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd it feels -- we feel confident that the procedures in place do demonstrate that an industry can do -- can contain and can deal with that kind of spill, which is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve issued these leases.\xc2\xa0 We think drilling and increasing production is important as long as it is done safely, as you can do both.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you come back and tell me if you\xe2\x80\x99re still pushing for a raising of that cap?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if we have anything for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you take that question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Going back to April\xe2\x80\x99s question -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing from people on the radio, going back to the question of $5.00 a gallon gas coming up in the summer, people are saying they are very concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 They understand a long-term solution, but they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about $5.00 a gallon gas in the summer.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about 10 percent, 15 percent increases in airfares.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about not going away this summer. And they want to know what the President can do to help them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about people who are supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies, but who are looking around and saying we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to go anywhere this summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Victoria, I would tell you that we are, again, very focused on this, extremely aware of the burden that it creates, and looking at ways that we can help alleviate it.\xc2\xa0 The reality is, as you know, and I hope as a host of a radio show, that you are responsibly informing your readers that there are no silver bullets to alleviate this problem; that the way to deal with this problem in the long term is to have a serious long-term energy policy that reduces our reliance on foreign-produced oil and increases our diversity of our supply of energy. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way we get out of this mess in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn the short, we are obviously looking at different measures we can take to help alleviate the impact of the oil -- rise in oil -- this rise in oil prices.\xc2\xa0 But, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for everyone here who talks about and writes about this issue to acknowledge the fact that administrations and congresses in the past have not succeeded in addressing this issue for the long term, which is why we continue to have these cycles of price hikes and a great deal of consternation followed by a lull when everyone ignores the need for a long-term energy policy because the prices at the pump have gone down.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe fact is, this President is focused on a long-term solution so that Americans in the future, and his successors have a policy in place that means that we will not suffer from the kind of swings from the policy -- sorry -- suffer the impacts of serious spikes in oil prices in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:21 P.M.
