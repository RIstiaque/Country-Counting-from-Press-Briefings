EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s an early start.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here as we make our way to West Point where the President will deliver the commencement address.\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have a few.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to say about helping Syrian rebels?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Steve, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said from the beginning of the conflict in Syria, the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s brutality against its own people creates a conflict that feeds extremism.\xc2\xa0 We look at the Syria conflict as a part of a broader counterterrorism challenge, and that is why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue increasing our support to the moderate opposition who offer the best alternative to both the murderous Assad dictatorship and the extremists who have exploited the crisis in Syria for their own malign purposes.\xc2\xa0 We will also continue to increase our support for Syria\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors as they continue to host refugees and confront the terrorist threat emanating from Syria.</p>\n<p>We have a range of options that we will continue discussing within the administration and with Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, is this more about confronting al Qaeda and other terrorist elements within the opposition in Syria rather than going after Assad?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, Jim, it\xe2\x80\x99s really both.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said and what has come to pass is that the conflict launched by Assad has fed extremism, and that is why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to provide support to the moderate opposition and to continue to enhance that support in order to create that alternative, the best alternative to both the Assad regime and the extremists who have found fertile ground in the chaos created by the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you confirm that the President is going to announce a new military training program for the Syrian opposition?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the let the President discuss.\xc2\xa0 What I did say is that we are always looking -- we have obviously provided support to the moderate opposition, and we will continue to increase that support appropriately, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details ahead of the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the $5 billion Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, what kind of groundwork have you guys laid on the Hill for that -- that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need Congress to actually move that through?\xc2\xa0 Is it your sense that it will be received well?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, because the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech today comes at a moment, following yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s update on the disposition of our forces in Afghanistan and the winding down of that combat mission, to provide a view of the way forward after a dozen years of war.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief and his approach and policy that we should be moving away from heavy concentrations of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and going after al Qaeda elements in the way that we have to address the conflicts and the threats that exist today through separate extremist groups, some closely and some lightly and some not at all affiliated with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund would allow us to provide the kind of support for our partners, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in Mali and assisting with what the French have done there, or in Somalia or Yemen, to counter the threat posed by extremists in different parts of the world, from South Asia to North Africa to the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And where does that money come from -- the $5 billion?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress on it.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s up to $5 billion.\xc2\xa0 And we believe there is an absolutely compelling case to be made for this approach to counter the threat posed by disparate groups of extremists around the world, including in those three -- especially in those three areas I identified.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President talk about the savings in the budget from the drawdown in Afghanistan, and what else he proposes to do with that money in addition to the counterterrorism fund?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to focus on the path forward and the policy proposals that he believes are correct to advance our national security interests and protect our country and our allies.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly the case that when you have a situation where just in Afghanistan alone we once had 100,000 troops, and by the beginning of next year we\xe2\x80\x99ll have 9,800, that we will be spending less for those kinds of operations.</p>\n<p>And I think that goes also to the point of the question earlier about the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund and the utility of taking an approach that the President will talk about today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has had a lot of criticism of his foreign policy, Jay.\xc2\xa0 What do you hope these critics will take away from this speech?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is going to be focused on critics.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on his vision and his policies for how to continue to demonstrate American leadership around the globe -- we are the only indispensable nation; he firmly believes that -- and the steps we need to take to counter the threats that exist in this world in the wake of all of the heroic efforts that our military have conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief is that we need to adapt to the threats that are there.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, in Afghanistan, as the President talked about yesterday, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made enormous progress in going after the core al Qaeda leadership, and in standing up Afghan National Security Forces so that they can provide the security necessary in that country so that it does not and cannot once again become a haven for al Qaeda or other extremist groups that would threaten the United States or our allies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, who\xe2\x80\x99s the speech for?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s the audience that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to reach?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to give a significant foreign policy address, so it\xe2\x80\x99s for the American --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it targeted towards the American public?\xc2\xa0 Is it targeted towards our U.S. allies overseas?\xc2\xa0 Is it targeted towards foreign policy elites, members of Congress?\xc2\xa0 Like, who is he -- what is the intent and the goal and the audience that he hopes to reach?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer to all those questions is, yes.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to reach every one of those audiences, because every one of those audiences has an interest and a stake in how we move forward after a dozen years of war.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate venue for that, as graduates of West Point will -- the current class of West Point graduates will be the first in a long time who are not likely to be deployed into a war zone -- at least not Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And I think that reflects the kind of transition we\xe2\x80\x99re making out of that footing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had for a dozen years as we tackle the challenges that we face today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on another subject -- school lunches.\xc2\xa0 CNN had a headline on the screen a few minutes ago that said, \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Lady In Food Fight With House GOP.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did the President -- what was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction or view of the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s event yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President and First Lady both feel very strongly about the need to continue moving forward when it comes to school nutrition and not allowing politics to pull us backward.\xc2\xa0 And I think the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s words speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is an important issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made an enormous amount of progress.\xc2\xa0 The fact is 90 percent of school districts are implementing the guidelines effectively.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s contributing to improved health for our kids.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely inappropriate to let politics and pressure from the food industry rescind this progress.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President and First Lady have taken the stand that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to those elections in Europe where isolationist parties seem to have made big gains?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it would impact in any way the T-TIP negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re still assessing the outcome of those elections.\xc2\xa0 We obviously believe very strongly that the advantages of T-TIP for Europe and the United States are clear, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with our European partners on those negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Ed Snowden gave an interview to NBC, wide-ranging interview.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction from the President to the remarks from Snowden?\xc2\xa0 One of them is that he felt stranded in Russia by the State Department in revoking his passport.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a reaction from the President.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed it with him.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Mr. Snowden faces felony charges here in the United States and he ought to return as soon as possible to the United States to face those charges and enjoy the rights and protections that defendants in this country enjoy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the other matter, Mr. Snowden has been charged with felonies and he ought to return to the United States.\xc2\xa0 He certainly has that option available to him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the outing of the CIA officer in Afghanistan over the weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the Chief of Staff has asked the White House Counsel to look into that and to make sure that we\'re taking steps so that something like that never happens again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President have a specific reaction to it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the immigration review, was there something specific that happened to -- not sure if it\'s the right word -- delay, whatever, to hold off on that for the summer?\xc2\xa0 Was there something specific, or just a compilation of things?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity in the next several months to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he had been hearing from various supporters of that effort, including, a few weeks ago, from evangelicals, but more broadly that there was concern that the review undertaken by Secretary Johnson could be misused, if you will, in order to make -- create an excuse for not taking action, and we certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want that to happen.\xc2\xa0 And that broad coalition of supporters of comprehensive immigration reform share the President\xe2\x80\x99s hope that we might see some action in the House.\xc2\xa0 And we wouldn\'t want to create a reason not to act, or an excuse not to act.</p>\n<p>So we\'re going to continue to press forward in Congress and hope that the House follows the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead, hears the voices of, again, a broad coalition of support out there among labor and business, law enforcement and faith communities who all believe that we need to take action that would better secure our border, make sure everybody plays by the same rules, all our businesses are held accountable to that, and that would create a permanent solution for the millions of people living in the shadows in the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the main take-away from that that if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t occur by the end of July, if immigration reform isn\'t taken up by the House by then, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance of it for the remainder of the President\xe2\x80\x99s presidency?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to speculate that far into the future.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of people believe that now is the time.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the Senate passed a bill in this Congress and the House has the opportunity to act.\xc2\xa0 There is no question, and I doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s a single question in this crowd or the broader White House press corps about the fact that if the Senate bill were put on the floor of the House it would pass with votes from Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking for the Senate bill, we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for the House to take action in its own way that reflects the need to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy if the House took up the Senate bill, but we understand that it may proceed differently.\xc2\xa0 The end result needs to be comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The speech time is at, like, half hour, hour?\xc2\xa0 What do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President looks forward to the opportunity to give a broad view of how he sees the United States moving forward in the wake of a dozen years, a decade or more of war.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put an endpoint on the speech, but I think it will be pretty comprehensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the Nigerian abductions -- the government in Nigeria says it knows where these girls are located.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. government have any information to prove that that\xe2\x80\x99s, in fact, true?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We cannot confirm that report.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously working closely and advising and assisting the Nigerian government as it seeks to find and rescue the abducted girls.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that the first step in that process is locating them, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have confirmation of that comment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t9:03 A.M.
