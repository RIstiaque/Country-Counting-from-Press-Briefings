EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Miami, Florida.\xc2\xa0 I did want to point out a tweet from Republican Florida Governor, Rick Scott, who on Friday noted that Miami experienced the largest over-the-year decline in their unemployment rate of any metropolitan area in the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President a little bit more today about what he believes that we should do to build on that progress and to build on what we can do to help our economy in south Florida and communities all across the country recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to give you a brief preview of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks later today.\xc2\xa0 So the President, during his remarks, will remind the American people who the real Mitt Romney is.\xc2\xa0 If you just tuned into the race over the last two weeks, you would have noticed -- you would be seeing, I should say, a Mitt Romney who seems to have no familiarity or recollection of his own positions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve been tuned into the race for two years or you simply clicked on his website, you\xe2\x80\x99d be very familiar with his positions that are very similar to the extreme right wing of his party on many issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, over the last couple of days, if he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing and his team is not willing to tell the truth about his own record, we will.\xc2\xa0 So you can look for that in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks later today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, on the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s debate today, what constitutes success for you going into it?\xc2\xa0 Do you guys need this debate to basically blunt any of the momentum that Romney has established since the last debate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, first I\xe2\x80\x99ll say the Vice President is pretty fired up and ready to go this evening for the debate.\xc2\xa0 His number-one goal is to lay out the choice for the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a big audience, as any of these debates are, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to speak directly about the differences between the candidates and the tickets and the positions they represent.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe question is, which Paul Ryan will show up this evening.\xc2\xa0 Will it be the Paul Ryan who\xe2\x80\x99s been called the intellectual leader of the Tea Party, of the right wing of the Republican Party, who has embraced voucherizing Medicare, who has embraced a $5 trillion tax cut package that would give benefits to millionaires and billionaires and leave the burden on the middle class?\xc2\xa0 Or is it the Paul Ryan who gave fact-checkers -- made fact-checkers work overtime during his convention speech; misled for bizarre reasons -- I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand -- about his own marathon time; and as recently as two weeks ago, said there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough time during a Sunday show appearance to explain his tax cut package?\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking out for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe expect it will be more of a conversation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be sitting down, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And we feel great about the Vice President and looking forward to watching this evening, which the President will do on the plane tonight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does this need to change the trajectory of the race for your campaign?\xc2\xa0 Do you think this gathering tonight, this debate tonight is important in changing the direction, the tone of the coverage?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re very comfortable with the direction of the campaign and the direction of our plans.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of the same polls I have, yes, Mitt Romney had a good night last week, he had a better night than President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Our focus since then has been communicating directly with the American people about the choice in this election.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will have a big opportunity to do that again tonight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been implementing our ground plan and our ground game in states across the country, and I have some specifics on Florida -- I can go through that with all of you as well.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s interesting here is that in the swing states, the seven to nine states where this campaign is being not only debated but will be decided, the race has been relatively stable.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s in part because we spent time this summer laying out for the American people what the President would do with another four years; the difference between his platform and the Republican platform.\xc2\xa0 And we feel, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, very confident in our ground game and what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo absolutely, tonight is an opportunity to continue to lay out the choice for the American people.\xc2\xa0 We have great confidence in the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re also in Miami today because the President is going to encourage people to early vote in just a couple of weeks, and get students out and engaged.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on that every day as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The battleground polls did show a little bit of movement in some states for Romney -- tightening of races here and there.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like Romney has got as much out of the debate as he\xe2\x80\x99s going to in those states?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, it has been about a week since the debate, as you know.\xc2\xa0 We always thought this race would be close.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re exactly where we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d be.\xc2\xa0 And we never thought we were going to win Ohio by 10 points or that Virginia and Florida and Colorado would be states where we won by five or six points.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as you mentioned, and I mentioned I guess a little bit earlier, there\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable consistency and stability in a lot of these state polls.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re back to maybe not quite where we were right before the debate, but certainly where we were right before the convention, and that\xe2\x80\x99s in part of because of the work we did all summer to lay out the choice in this election.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of the other things that you saw, that we all saw, in those polls was that 20 percent of people have already voted and they\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to vote.\xc2\xa0 Only 6 or 7 percent I think of people polled in those polls said that they were impacted by the debate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as the President said in his ABC interview, he knows he had a bad night, he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to the debate next week.\xc2\xa0 We know it\xe2\x80\x99s a big opportunity, and we feel good about how prepared he\xe2\x80\x99ll be and his excitement about doing this again and having a conversation with the people in the room.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how things go from there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen and Josh, I have a China-related question about the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Hank Greenberg, the former AIG chairman, told Bloomberg today in an interview that he believes Romney, if he\xe2\x80\x99s elected, would reverse his position as it related to labeling China a currency manipulator.\xc2\xa0 He said that the U.S. would have a choice between a trade agreement or a trade war.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that this is also true?\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that Romney would go through with the currency manipulator step if he were elected?\xc2\xa0 Or do you believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s a campaign tactic?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I start just by pointing out that the President has engaged over the course of his three and a half years in office in dealing with China in a way that ensures a level playing field for American workers.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly welcomes international competition but only with a level playing field -- a playing field that\xe2\x80\x99s level for American workers and for American businesses and for American entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President is confident that if that playing field is leveled, that American businesses can succeed in that kind of environment, and so that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99s done in his conversations with Chinese leaders.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, something that members of the administration have done with their Chinese counterparts at every turn, and on a range of issues, not just on the issue of currency valuation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat has also been true in dealing with some trade programs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot over the last couple of weeks about the efforts at the WTO told hold China accountable for unfair trade policies.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President has done repeatedly with a significant benefit that\xe2\x80\x99s accrued to the American people for that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done when it comes to intellectual property to ensure that the Chinese government is not allowed to -- or Chinese businesses are not allowed to unfairly steal the ideas and hard work of American entrepreneurs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Governor Romney, do you believe that he would go through with what he said on the campaign trail?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 One other thing I would point out and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jen take this -- the one other thing that I would point out is that Mr. Greenberg is not the only business leader in this country to raise concerns about the impact that labeling China a currency manipulator could have on our economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States Chamber of Commerce, who, as you know, is spending tens of millions of dollars in campaigns all across the country to try to defeat Democrats in Congress and other allies of the President in Congress, has also expressed concerns about the impact that Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s promise could have on our economy.\xc2\xa0 So it might tell you the seriousness with which they confront this issue, they consider this issue, if the position that they are taking seems to align with the tact that the President has taken in dealing with China on this very important issue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what do you think about Romney?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think to the degree that people in this country are paying attention to China as an issue they\xe2\x80\x99re voting on, which is -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in states like Ohio, it very much is an issue that people are tuning into.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at, in our view, is the actions and the seriousness with which these candidates have taken the issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s only one candidate who has taken nine trade actions against China, only one candidate who has held them accountable on tariffs and held their feet to the fire on unfair trade practices.\xc2\xa0 Those are steps the President has taken that Mitt Romney has criticized.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen pretty clearly over the last couple of days and weeks that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to say and do anything to become President.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mesh with his conservative record and with his record on this website, and his record he\xe2\x80\x99s been running on for the last six years.\xc2\xa0 It would be virtually impossible for us to predict what things he will try to change his rhetoric on in the next few weeks, never mind in the weeks after he would become President.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have that opportunity, so hopefully we won\xe2\x80\x99t have to address it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moscow announced yesterday that they no longer wanted to extend -- adjudicate all U.S.-funded arms disposal initiative and that has helped them to commission dozens of nuclear weapons -- warheads, rather.\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction to that, if you have any?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have one.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is a valuable program and has been beneficial for United States national security.\xc2\xa0 There is certainly more work to be done in that program and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to engage in that effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has a long record of dealing with these issues.\xc2\xa0 Many of you traveled to Seoul earlier this year to cover the Nuclear Security Summit.\xc2\xa0 Many of you also covered the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts as a United States senator, where he worked cooperatively with Senator Lugar from Indiana to confront the nuclear threat -- or the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by loose nuclear materials and loose nuclear weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has a long record on these issues and we found the Russians to be good partners on these issues.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lugar himself commented recently -- just in the last day or two, I believe -- that in talking with his counterparts in Russia, it was his understanding that the Russians didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to actually end the program, but rather that after 20 years of this program being in place, they wanted to update the program.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we will work with him to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, along those lines, Moscow has raised objections to Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s decision to intercept an aircraft from Syria -- coming from Russia to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration think that the Syrians were justified -- that the Turks were justified in detaining that aircraft?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, along those lines, Moscow has raised objections to Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s decision to intercept an aircraft from Syria -- coming from Russia to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration think that the Syrians were justified -- that the Turks were justified in detaining that aircraft?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have seen reports about the actions that the Turks took to examine that plane, to force it to land and to investigate the contents of the plane.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on their decision to do so or what they found.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I can tell you is that it\xe2\x80\x99s the longstanding policy of this administration that the flow of arms to the Assad regime needs to be shut down.\xc2\xa0 And we have been working aggressively with our allies and partners in the region and around the world to end the flow of arms to the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 The reason we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that is because the Assad regime has used those weapons to perpetrate heinous acts of violence against the people of Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we stand with our partners and our allies as they work to stem the flow of weapons to the Assad regime, and we certainly stand with the Turks as they confront a number of challenges that are posed by instability in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an influx of refugees along the border between Syria and Turkey.\xc2\xa0 We have seen some border shells mortar shells launched by Syrian soldiers that have landed in -- across the border into Turkey.\xc2\xa0 And the Turkish citizens have sustained some casualties as a result of this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the House hearing on Libyan embassy security yesterday -- did the President feel that hearing was useful?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, I have not talked to the President about his reaction to the hearing.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along and the President has said even in the immediate aftermath of this terrible incident that he believed it was important for us to get to the bottom of what exactly happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have here a situation where four Americans serving this country overseas tragically lost their lives.\xc2\xa0 The President takes that very seriously.\xc2\xa0 The President knew Ambassador Stevens personally.\xc2\xa0 The President, both personally but also as the Commander-in-Chief, wants to get to the bottom of exactly what happened, wants to ensure that the people who perpetrated this terrible act are held accountable for their actions, that they\xe2\x80\x99re brought to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President also wants to make sure that we are conducting a review of our diplomatic facilities all around the world to ensure that they are secure and that our diplomats are protected.\xc2\xa0 This is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s asked the State Department to do.\xc2\xa0 They are doing that in the course of this Accountability Review Board that\xe2\x80\x99s been stood up to take a look at these issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe FBI is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s conducting the investigation to try to determine who perpetrated these actions.\xc2\xa0 The President is following these investigations.\xc2\xa0 And what we will try to do as these investigations run their course, try to share with you the results of those investigations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to share based on those recommendations, but the President does feel an obligation to the American people to share with them what happened and what steps we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take to minimize the threat or at least reduce the threat to our diplomats who are doing some very dangerous but important work in countries all around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in the briefing yesterday, Jay said that the President referred to the attack in Libya the next day, on September 12th, as an act of terror.\xc2\xa0 In his public remarks that day what he said was, \xe2\x80\x9cNo acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation,\xe2\x80\x9d which could be perceived as being a comment on the general situation in the region, not necessarily directed towards Libya specifically.\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether that\xe2\x80\x99s what Jay was referring to in terms of how the President characterized the attack the day after?\xc2\xa0 Were there other comments that he referred more directly to the attack on Libya as a terrorist attack?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jay was referring to the President\xe2\x80\x99s public comments that day.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments were declarative and an expression of the resolve of the American people that in the face of this violence, the United States is not going to shrink from engaging in nations all around the world.\xc2\xa0 There are diplomats and of course our military personnel who are operating in very dangerous environments to represent the United States of America and to ensure that the interests of the American people are represented in countries all around the world.\xc2\xa0 And even in the face of terrible violence and in the face of an act of terror like this, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to shrink from those responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement was pretty clear and very declarative for a reason.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CNN had an interview with Pat Smith, the mother of one of the victims of the Benghazi attacks.\xc2\xa0 She said that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t received much information at all about the cause of her son\xe2\x80\x99s death or any other information, details related to the investigation.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration think they\xe2\x80\x99ve done a sufficient job in communicating with family members of the victims?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to speak to the communications between our administration and the families of those who were lost just about a month or so ago.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President has spoken with the family of Mr. Smith, has articulated his condolences to them personally, and remains committed to ensuring that they get the kind of information that they deserve about what exactly happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is -- as I alluded to, the President does and this administration will continue to communicate with the American public about what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to communicate with the American public about our efforts to bring the perpetrators of this act of terror to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, the burden of communicating that information is even higher for those who have sacrificed so much for this country.\xc2\xa0 And that is an ongoing process, and that is something that the President and other senior members of his administration are committed to living up to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, does the shooting in Yemen further the President\xe2\x80\x99s concern about the safety of our diplomatic personnel in the Middle East?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have seen the reports that a Yemeni citizen who was employed at the American embassy in Sana\xe2\x80\x99a was killed today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information on the circumstances around that shooting.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that American officials have been in touch with our Yemeni counterparts as they conduct an investigation into what exactly happened, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stay in touch with them as that investigation is carried out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the culprits are affiliated with al Qaeda?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the investigation that the Yemenis are conducting.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in close touch with them as they conduct that investigation, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to jump to any conclusions about where that investigation might lead at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The RNC, in communications with the DOJ, is raising concerns that the campaign may be inadvertently or whatever getting foreign contributions, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that you can address at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I have seen reports of that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an absurd, baseless attack.\xc2\xa0 We have actually put up a debunking Truth Team post on our website I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to send you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good Truth Team plug right there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so I will circulate that to all of you as well during the flight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the incident with the Miami parking garage, we were wondering whether -- collapse -- whether the President has been or plans to be in touch with any family members or anything like that at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not the President will be in touch with anybody locally on that.\xc2\xa0 I can check on that for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Let me just give you two quick stats on Florida that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t include this morning.\xc2\xa0 Democrats have a 450,000-person voter advantage -- voter registration advantage in Florida over Republicans.\xc2\xa0 In the last three months, Democrats have registered 15,000 more Florida voters than Republicans have registered.\xc2\xa0 Forty-four percent of new registrants are under 30.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd last one is that at this point in 2008, Republicans outnumbered Democrats among absentee mail voters by more than 245,000.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve narrowed that gap, that margin, so now it\xe2\x80\x99s just over 70,000.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Jen, today is his last fundraiser before the election?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I would just say one of the last.\xc2\xa0 We still have a few weeks to go here.\xc2\xa0 We certainly want people to continue to contribute to the campaign, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of where we are in the schedule, but happily can say one of the last.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Vice President debate, does he intend to watch the first hour of the debate aboard?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The President?\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching it on the plane this evening and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know, depending on how the timing works, his reaction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he wanted to come back and watch it with us, that would be like an interesting social experiment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let him know what kind of snacks will you have.\xc2\xa0 That will be the determining factor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have a chance to speak by phone with Vice President Biden yet today?\xc2\xa0 Will they talk throughout the day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Not as of yet.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as you know, they speak on a regular basis about a range of topics.\xc2\xa0 We will let you know and keep you updated on that throughout the day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:02 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
