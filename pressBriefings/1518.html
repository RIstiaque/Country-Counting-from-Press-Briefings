EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Morning?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know, it\'s not really morning.\xc2\xa0 I\'m pretty sure my schedule will be completely messed up by the time we get home.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Public option -- is it dead or not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to tell you, this is one of the more curious things I\'ve ever seen in my life.\xc2\xa0 I was on a Sunday show, I said the same thing about a public option that I\'ve said for I don\'t know how many weeks.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary reiterated what the President said the day before, and you\'d think there was some new policy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The language appeared to be --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The language "appeared" to be?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the language on Saturday -- the President made -- saying that the public option was only a sliver, and whether it\'s in it or it isn\'t in it seems to move the ball a little bit from where you guys were.\xc2\xa0 No?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think you can go back and find the President saying -- look, the President has said that\'s his preference, but the President has also said I don\'t know how many times if the goals are choice and competition, right, the reason you have a public option is because you have an insurance market that doesn\'t have choice or competition.\xc2\xa0 If somebody is trying to seek private insurance on -- private health insurance on a private market and only has -- because this happens in some areas or in some states where there\'s one insurance company that does business in that region, that that is -- that doesn\'t ensure the type of affordability and quality that you\'d want to see in a health insurance system.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So you have some competition that provides some choice, so that if a family of four might have different insurance needs than a single person or a couple that\'s married with no children or what have you.\xc2\xa0 The goals are choice and competition.\xc2\xa0 His preference is a public option.\xc2\xa0 If there are other ideas, he\'s happy to look at them.\xc2\xa0 Because I think his -- I think this is true not only for the issue of health care, but for virtually every other issue that he\'ll ever deal with in public life is he has goals about what he wants to accomplish and he\'s not necessarily wedded to one -- only one way of getting there.\xc2\xa0 I think he\'s said that a hundred times.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be completely clear, has anything changed on the public option?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I challenge you guys all to go back and see what we\'ve said about this over the course of many, many, many, many months, and you\'ll find a boring consistency to our rhetoric.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The rhetoric, as you say, might be consistent, but the movement on the ground, so to speak, toward legislation hasn\'t been.\xc2\xa0 Is there any recognition now that a public option is looking less likely to be part of a final deal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me make sure I understand your question, because I want to know if it\'s -- is this predicated on legislative developments since Congress has been out of session, or are we trying to match the stampede of a series of stories to if not the consistent language that we\'ve all been saying to some now legislative vote?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s just looking more and more likely that a public option is not going to be part of the final bill.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the White House is --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do think -- can I just -- I want to point out the -- how do I phrase this -- massive irony that I don\'t know that I saw any of your stories denote the fact that this might be -- that you\'re surmising now this was a political reality rather than --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re asking.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, but did you think from the phrasing of Julianna\'s question that we might be coming to justify a series of stampeding stories in one direction based on something different than what we\'ve always said?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys have -- you haven\'t exactly come out publicly since Sebelius\' statement yesterday, come in front of the cameras to speak to us, to downplay --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because nothing has changed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you haven\'t downplayed the remarks and the coverage either.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think many people talked to you all yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think people sent e-mails.\xc2\xa0 David Axelrod called people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t get an e-mail from you.\xc2\xa0 Nothing has changed.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we can go out and say nothing has changed, but that seems sort of silly since nothing has changed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Look, in terms of the political realities, obviously there\'s a public plan -- or public option in the House bill.\xc2\xa0 There is a public option in the HELP bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the Senate Finance Committee will come out with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President talks about the special interests and railing against the special interests on health care, who is he referring to -- criticized special interests, lobbyists, and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically, those you\'re referring to.\xc2\xa0 What constituencies?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Interest groups that are aligned to keep the status quo either because it benefits them or they have a vested interest in -- or because they have a vested interest in it not changing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he would include drug makers in that, or not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Drug makers, if you\'re a member of PhRMA, you\'ve come to an agreement about health care reform happening this year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\'s referring to special interests who are not on board with reform?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, to be critical of somebody who\'s not for reform, you typically would have to be opposed to the President\'s plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it seems that there are actually a lot of special interests that are in favor of reform.\xc2\xa0 So --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess I\'m confused at where you\'re heading here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m -- he gets up there, he rails against special interests, but yet there are special interests who are allies of the White House, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But let\'s be clear.\xc2\xa0 You can rail against special interests that are for -- it\'d be sort of odd to go to a town hall meeting and rail against interest groups that are supporting reform -- right -- who have acknowledged that it\'s time for health care reform; acknowledged that the system as we currently have it either isn\'t working for patients or doctors or nurses or seniors or young people or budgets or the government.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then, specifically, who?\xc2\xa0 Can you give me a couple examples of --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President mentioned the other day that there are insurance companies that are for the status quo.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ve produced a list.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to find that for you.\xc2\xa0 There\'s groups that have run commercials, right?\xc2\xa0 Dick Armey\'s group has been out there.\xc2\xa0 I\'d point you to Dick Armey\'s comments on Medicare today, as well.\xc2\xa0 But Dick Armey\'s group is out there actively getting people to go to town halls and yell at members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The Conservatives for Patients\' Rights, the gentleman who has in his list of lifetime accomplishments, "receiving the largest Medicare fine in the history of the entire program," who spent millions of dollars to go on TV and criticize health care reform.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a list of people that are special interests who oppose a change and reform in health care.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching topics --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, can I ask one more health care question?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\'s message to Chairman Baucus regarding the public option during their meetings on Friday?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the degree which that particularly came up.\xc2\xa0 I think they were talking more about the global process, about trying to get consensus in the Finance Committee.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that have to involve public option of some sort?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously they\'ll make a decision about it.\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t talk to me about whether or not that specifically came up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Swapping topics a little bit to tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 What does the President hope to achieve with his meeting with Mubarak?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think this is continuing our outreach in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to get ahead of what the President will tell Mubarak.\xc2\xa0 But I think obviously each country in the region on either side of this issue has certain responsibilities to uphold as we make progress toward a lasting peace in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 And without a recognition of those responsibilities it\'s going to be hard to move forward.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President will take some time to talk through that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything else specifically that he wants to discuss?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- let me just leave at that, then we\'ll have -- you guys will have a chance to talk to them tomorrow afternoon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More broadly, sort of six months from sort of starting his Middle East peace push, how does the President feel things are sort of developing?\xc2\xa0 It seems we\'ve gone to a situation now where the Arabs are telling the Israelis, you\'ve got to go first, and the Israelis are telling the Arabs, you\'ve got to go first.\xc2\xa0 Is there any way you can sort of unblock that situation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- I think most Middle East observers will tell you that progress on this issue is not going to be made unless or until there\'s sustained involvement by the United States; that if we look back at progress that has been made, it\'s generally been with the involvement of the United States, because we all understand it\'s in our national interest.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the President talked throughout -- has talked throughout his time in public life as saying that most of all, what we have to have is have that sustained engagement that allows the two parties to work with each other and make progress.\xc2\xa0 And without it, what happens, we tend to see -- we tend to see the absence of that progress.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think instead of -- instead of waiting until the end of a certain term or a certain time to have that engagement, the President\'s plan is to -- was to do that from the very beginning, and I think you saw that in the phone calls that he made the very first full day -- his very first full day in office.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll continue to do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to Mubarak since the June meeting?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe he has but I will double-check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe he has since then.\xc2\xa0 They haven\'t -- I mean, they haven\'t spoken on the phone, I should say.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How else --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, they could communicate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s got the e-mail address.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You could write a letter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have the BlackBerry --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have the e-mail address?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0 Just by letter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'ll let us know if any communication has --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, I\'ll double check with those guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a change in the schedule for the rest of the week?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, though I have to admit, having been out West, I\'m a bit out of the -- I\'m happily out of the scheduling loop for a couple days.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll try to update you tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon in the briefing if any events have been added.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure there have, just as they have been fleshed out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the reason that we moved the schedule up earlier today -- was there any special reason?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, just he was -- he was up a little earlier, and the VFW could take us a little earlier, and I think he\'s probably anxious to get back over -- to get back out East, much to our chagrin.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the format for tomorrow, is it -- with Mubarak?\xc2\xa0 Is it the usual one-on-one, expanded delegations, lunch, that kind of thing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe so.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I have not seen the full itinerary, but I don\'t know why that would be different.\xc2\xa0 And then I don\'t know where we\'re doing the spray with the questions, but we\'ll have all that information out for you guys either in tonight\'s guidance or first thing tomorrow morning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the budget mid-session review coming out in the next few weeks, are you guys expecting good news or bad news?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think obviously the biggest driver in a budget right now is the state of the economy.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s pretty safe to assume that the economy over the course of the first six months, particularly that first three months that the President was in office, we\'ve talked about numerous times deteriorated at a rapid pace unlike anything anybody imagined.\xc2\xa0 So I think in many ways it has only sharpened our budget challenges.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not seen the final documents or things like that, but I don\'t think there\'s any doubt the challenges remain to get our fiscal house in order.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think you\'ve heard the President at town hall meetings talk about the importance of making sure that health care reform is paid for.\xc2\xa0 I think he, at the end of -- particularly at the end of the Colorado town hall meeting, you know, he talked about, you know, Congress -- and the President added an expensive drug benefit through Medicare that we didn\'t pay for.\xc2\xa0 We went to war in Iraq that we didn\'t pay for.\xc2\xa0 We made a lot of cognitive decisions that we knew would be expensive, and we made them knowing we weren\'t going to pay for them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President has a different idea about that -- that reform has to be something that we pay for because we have to get our fiscal house in order, we have to change the cost curve for Medicare and Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 Families can\'t afford health care to continue to skyrocket at this rate.\xc2\xa0 Neither, quite frankly, can the government.</div> <div class="legacy-para">All right, enjoy your flight home.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 5:05 P.M.
