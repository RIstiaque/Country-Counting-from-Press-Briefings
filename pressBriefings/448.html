Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>**Please see below for a correction marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>11:20 A.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see all of your smiling faces on this Monday morning.\xc2\xa0 I\'m joined this morning by the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s preparing to have lunch with the President and a handful of teachers who are here at the White House in a few minutes, and so we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d bring him to the briefing room while he was here to talk about some of the announcements that were made at the Department of Education today to make sure that we have a good, quality teacher in every classroom.</p>\n<p>So with that, we\'ll let Secretary Duncan make some opening remarks.\xc2\xa0 Then we\'ll take your questions and then after that we\'ll move on to our other business today.</p>\n<p>So, Mr. Secretary.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.</p>\n<p>Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Over the past couple years I\'ve had the opportunity to meet with literally hundreds and hundreds of fantastic educators across all 50 states.\xc2\xa0 As Josh said, in a few minutes the President and I will meet with a couple more to talk about their experiences.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Helping all students reach their full potential is quite simply the life work of America\xe2\x80\x99s great teachers and principals, and these educators absolutely know the enormous challenges that students growing up in poverty can face.\xc2\xa0 Right now, across the country, despite teachers\xe2\x80\x99 and principals\xe2\x80\x99 herculean efforts, students from low-income families and students of color often face daunting achievement gaps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the 2014 NAEP Assessment, only 24 percent of students eligible for free lunch were proficient on the 4th grade math test, compared to almost 60 percent of other students.\xc2\xa0 And as everyone here knows, access to great teachers has far-reaching positive impacts -- effects for students, including increased achievement levels, increased likelihood of college attendance, and higher wages over their lifetime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Other high-performing countries not only understand this profound truth, but more importantly, they act upon it.\xc2\xa0 In South Korea, for example, according to one study, students from low-income families are actually more likely than students from wealthier families to have access to high-quality teachers.</p>\n<p>But we\'ve struggled with that here in the United States, and today, race and family income too often still predict students\xe2\x80\x99 access to excellent educators.\xc2\xa0 That is simply unacceptable and we must do better, and do better together.</p>\n<p>For example, in Louisiana, the percentage of teachers rated effective is 50 percent higher in low-poverty, low-minority schools than in high-poverty, high-minority schools.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, in Tennessee, low-poverty, low-minority schools have almost 33 percent more teachers who are rated highly effective when compared to high-poverty, high-minority schools.\xc2\xa0 And in North Carolina, highly effective teachers are 50 percent more likely to leave a disadvantaged school than a school of more privilege.</p>\n<p>By no means are these states alone.\xc2\xa0 Actually, far from it. And I applaud their courage in making this information public and transparent.\xc2\xa0 Change can only come when we deal openly and honestly with the facts, and we need more states and districts to challenge the status quo.</p>\n<p>This problem exists because of systemic inequities that shortchange certain schools, communities and districts across the country.\xc2\xa0 Teachers and principals are not the problem, and they are absolutely essential elements of the solution.\xc2\xa0 They devote their lives to preparing our students for college and careers.\xc2\xa0 And we need to provide the support that they need to succeed and stay in high-need schools where their talent and their commitment is so desperately needed.</p>\n<p>Today, in collaboration with our partners, we launched the Excellent Educators for All Initiative, a three-pronged strategic effort to help states and districts support great teachers and principals to come to and stay in high-need schools and communities.</p>\n<p>First, we\xe2\x80\x99re asking states to submit comprehensive plans to ensure progress towards educator equity based on data and input from teachers, districts and community groups, and to submit that to our department by April 2015.</p>\n<p>Second, this fall we\xe2\x80\x99ll use $4.2 million to launch the new Educator Equity Support Network to provide states and districts real-time support in developing and implementing their plans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd third, this fall we\xe2\x80\x99ll publish Educator Equity profiles to help states use data to identify gaps in access through expert teaching for low-income and minority students, as well as high-need schools that are consistently beating the odds and that can serve as examples for other schools across the nation.\xc2\xa0 We will update these profiles every two years, using our Civil Rights Data Collection Project, and monitor states\xe2\x80\x99 progress towards their goals.\xc2\xa0 And we urge states to publicly report their progress on their own metrics each year, encouraging ongoing public dialogue, input and ideas, and revise their plans as necessary.</p>\n<p>This announcement builds on months of outreach to crucial partners at every level, including an inspiring conversation hosted by the Council of Chief State School Officers with state and civil rights leaders.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank CCSSO for being a fantastic partner.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep pushing each other to be bold, to act with urgency, and to meet these tough challenges with thoughtful, creative solutions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The simple truth is that all students deserve excellent educators, and all educators deserve our full support.\xc2\xa0 To reach these goals, there are no magic bullets or quick fixes, and the best ideas, quite frankly, won\xe2\x80\x99t come from any of us here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 We want to help states and districts to be creative in recruiting, supporting and retaining the excellent educators in high-need schools, and we want to encourage them to involve and listen to the teachers and principals who are doing this hard work every single day.</p>\n<p>This is one part of a larger educational equity conversation in which we\xe2\x80\x99re working to promote fiscal equity, as well as equal access to high-quality preschool, rigorous college and career-ready coursework, social and emotional support, and fair and appropriate school discipline policies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur department won\xe2\x80\x99t require any particular approach, but I can share some common themes that we have consistently heard from fantastic teachers and principals across the nation who are doing this work.</p>\n<p>First, great teachers follow great principals, so we should all work to improve the quality and stability of leaders in high-need schools.\xc2\xa0 Second, great teachers want to work on a team with other great teachers and need time to collaborate, so we need to help provide flexibility to allow this to happen.\xc2\xa0 Third, great teachers need extra help and support, particularly early on in their careers, so we should provide high-quality coaching, mentorship and professional learning opportunities to teachers in high-need schools.\xc2\xa0 Fourth, great teachers want to grow and take on additional leadership responsibilities, so we need to create opportunities that don\xe2\x80\x99t require them to leave the classroom to advance professionally and have greater impact.\xc2\xa0 Fifth, great teachers absolutely deserve to be well paid for these extra efforts and responsibilities, and for their effectiveness in keeping students on track to succeed in college and career.\xc2\xa0 And finally, great teachers and principals are in it for the long haul, and we must be as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Meaningful reform will take tireless work and relentless commitment.\xc2\xa0 The good news here is that across the country, many people are taking real action, showing real courage and creativity in working to challenge the status quo.\xc2\xa0 In Boston, the district is partnering with Teach Plus to recruit and support and retain teams of effective, experienced teachers, and results for students have been pretty profound.</p>\n<p>In Louisiana, the State Department of Education is implementing the TAP System for teacher and student advancement in 66 schools with a high concentration of minority and low-income students.\xc2\xa0 Teachers there get intense support and differential compensation, and the early results for those TAP schools are very promising.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the imbalance between highly effective and less effective teachers has basically closed in those schools.</p>\n<p>And finally, in Ohio, the state has provided $15 million in a four-year grant to the Ohio Appalachian Collaborative to help 27 rural districts join together in addressing the unique challenges they face in ensuring their teachers have the support that they need.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, together, let\xe2\x80\x99s shape a conversation that is national in scope but local in its solutions.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s find a way that supports students and educators, and let\xe2\x80\x99s keep working together until we make these changes the reality for every single child in the country.</p>\n<p>Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop there and take any questions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie, want to start us off?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 The NEA seems to be pinning some of its frustration with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s education policies on you directly.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve voted over the last couple of days to call for your resignation.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could respond both to that call and also their broader concerns about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I try and stay out of local union politics; I think most teachers do, too.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a very good working relationship with the NEA in the past -- meet every month for breakfast with them, have worked together on a national labor management summit, conference every single year.\xc2\xa0 They, as you know, elected a new president, and we wish her the best of luck and look forward to working very closely with them as we move forward.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you did not mention tenure in your points of emphasis in this initiative, and as you know and commented on, in California they had this sort of earthquake throughout the entire primary school system with removal of tenure.\xc2\xa0 And you were generally praiseworthy of that at the time and identified that some of the students who brought the suit were victimized by some of the things you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to address here.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us about how tenure fits into that?\xc2\xa0 And when you said earlier that teachers and principals are not the problem, your complimentary reaction to the tenure decision in California suggested some teachers, in fact, are the problem.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ll be very, very clear that I will always support due process rights.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s critically important.\xc2\xa0 I will always support the right to tenure.\xc2\xa0 We just want that to be a meaningful bar.\xc2\xa0 I think there in California, I think some folks were getting tenure after 18 months, and this should be something that\xe2\x80\x99s earned by demonstrating effectiveness.</p>\n<p>And we think across the country, folks can come together -- they can either litigate this for the next 10 years all over the nation, or we can come together to think about how we absolutely support teachers and how we help make sure that students are supported as well.\xc2\xa0 And those interests should absolutely be linked, and we think there\xe2\x80\x99s a common-sense way to do that and we hope folks will come together to work on that together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how or if these education equity profiles will play into states waivers for No Child Left Behind going forward.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at this going forward.\xc2\xa0 And again, we just really want states to take this very, very seriously; that if we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about closing achievement gaps, I keep saying we have to be serious about closing opportunity gaps.\xc2\xa0 And we know how critically important great teachers and great principals are to closing those gaps and giving disadvantaged children a chance to be successful.\xc2\xa0 So shining a spotlight on this, having courageous conversations we think is very, very important to going where we need to as a nation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will you link it explicitly to those waivers?\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the department had talked about before.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll look at this as a piece of many things we\xe2\x80\x99re considering.\xc2\xa0 But again, having states focus on this and have public, transparent conversations about where they are, where they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to go, and then publicly, what progress they\xe2\x80\x99re making towards those goals, we think this is a very important exercise for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s undertaking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, last month Governor Jindal of Louisiana became the fourth governor to want to pull out of Common Core.\xc2\xa0 What do you think of that move on his part?\xc2\xa0 And how do these new reforms you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today relate to Common Core?\xc2\xa0 Are they on top of it, instead of it, in addition to, or what?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, great teachers are essential to everything we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do to help students.\xc2\xa0 So we think it\xe2\x80\x99s essential to moving education forward as a nation.</p>\n<p>Across the country, as we go into the fall, over 40 states are moving forward with higher standards.\xc2\xa0 We think that\'s very\xc2\xa0 -- we think that\'s fantastic.\xc2\xa0 We think in Louisiana, the Governor is a little bit isolated there.\xc2\xa0 The state board, the business community, teachers are all moving forward.\xc2\xa0 Teachers need the support of their statehouses to raise the bar.\xc2\xa0 And again, having high standards, telling children the truth about where they are in terms of being truly college- and career-ready, we think that\'s absolutely the right thing to do for the nation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re sticking with Common Core?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been for high standards.\xc2\xa0 High standards, that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re about -- truly preparing students for college and career.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today has no congressional component it sounds like.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It does not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this coming about because you asked Congress to do something they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do?\xc2\xa0 This is more of a pen-and-phone thing that the President is looking at?\xc2\xa0 Or where does Congress fit in?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99d love to partner with Congress on any and everything we do.\xc2\xa0 We obviously would have loved Congress to fix No Child Left Behind, which is broken.\xc2\xa0 To tie back to the previous question, one of the unintended consequence of the No Child Left Behind law is about 20 states dummied down their standards to make politicians look good, and that was bad for children, it was bad for education, it was bad for the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we want to raise standards, and we want to take on this equity challenge, this equity agenda in a very serious way.\xc2\xa0 In a perfect world, we would be addressing this in a bipartisan way with Congress and fixing No Child Left Behind.\xc2\xa0 We stand ready to do that today, tomorrow, next week, next month.\xc2\xa0 But we just can\'t continue to wait.\xc2\xa0 And our children have one chance to get a great education, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move now.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The plans that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking the state school chiefs to submit were really started under the 2006 law, right?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Correct, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are asking them to update?\xc2\xa0 Or are there just a lot of states that never sent them in in the first place?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think states submitted them before -- again, that\'s seven, eight years ago -- so asking states to come look at -- be transparent in their data, what\xe2\x80\x99s working, what\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 Some places are doing a great job of taking this on.\xc2\xa0 Others aren\xe2\x80\x99t taking it so seriously, but really giving them a chance to put their best foot forward, their best thinking forward.\xc2\xa0 And again, the state chief officers have been a fantastic partner here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a real level of courage and commitment, which makes me very hopeful about where we can go.\xc2\xa0 No one is trying to sweep this stuff under the rug, and we want them to submit their plans and then, on a forward basis, have clear metrics, measure themselves against those metrics, be transparent in that, and this be part of the business of what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing as we move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re also saying in the documents that you released earlier today that inexperienced teachers often are in high-need schools.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Disproportionately, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So where do you think inexperienced teachers should go?\xc2\xa0 Where should first-year, second-year teachers --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 They should go everywhere, and again, we\'ve had amazing, amazing first-year teachers, obviously.\xc2\xa0 But when you just have -- like any team, you have a diversity of veterans and some younger players as well.\xc2\xa0 So when a school or a school district or a set of schools in a disadvantaged community has disproportionate numbers of inexperienced teachers, that\'s not a good thing.\xc2\xa0 You want a balance on any team, and what we\'re looking for is to increase effectiveness in disadvantaged communities.\xc2\xa0 As a nation, we\'ve had far too few incentives and, frankly, lots of disincentives, for the hardest working, the most committed teachers and principals to go to the communities who need the most help.\xc2\xa0 And we have to, together, reverse that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I\'ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary has got a lunch he\xe2\x80\x99s got to get to you may have heard about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a direct response to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 The NEA has directly called for your resignation, and the AFT have said they appreciate the sentiment behind that call -- the two, obviously, largest teachers unions.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a direct response to that.\xc2\xa0 And also, is it an indication that when it comes to the common reforms that you and others have been pushing over the years, whether it be on things like tenure or expanding charter schools, being able to remove ineffective teachers, are the teachers unions simply, then, obstacles to reform?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, the reality is much more complex than that.\xc2\xa0 For example, today in this announcement, Randi Weingarten, the head of the AFT, is standing with us.\xc2\xa0 And the NEA is just finishing up their convention; were they not at their convention, I think they probably would have stood with us on this.\xc2\xa0 And so we agree on many issues.\xc2\xa0 We disagree occasionally.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t get caught in union politics.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work very closely with both major unions, work very closely with state unions as well, and generally, we\'ve had very good working relationships.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything at the top other than what the Secretary had to say, so, Julie, we\'ll go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask about the reports about some possible U.S. spying in Germany, reports that a German intelligence employee spied for the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Are you in a position to be able to confirm whether that is accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to do that, Julie.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen those reports and we are aware that a German citizen was arrested over the weekend, alongside the claim that he was purportedly working with a U.S. intelligence agency.</p>\n<p>The reason I can\'t comment on this particular matter is it involves two things, and the first is a pending German law enforcement investigation.\xc2\xa0 I would not want to get ahead of that or interfere in that investigation.\xc2\xa0 And additionally, it obviously goes to a purportedly direct intelligence matter as it relates to the United States and that\'s not something that I frequently comment on from the podium here.</p>\n<p>What I can say more generally, though, is the relationship that the United States has with Germany is incredibly important. This is a very close partnership that we have on a range of security issues, including some intelligence issues.\xc2\xa0 That partnership is built on respect and it\'s built on decades of cooperation and shared values.\xc2\xa0 All of those things are high priorities not just of this administration but of this country.</p>\n<p>So we\'re going to work with the Germans to resolve this situation appropriately.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chancellor Merkel said today that if these reports are true that it would be a \xe2\x80\x9cclear contradiction of trust between allies.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s obviously a big \xe2\x80\x9cif.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if this were to be true, if this were to be the kind of spying and intelligence work that the U.S. does in a country like Germany, a close ally, is that something that the President would be comfortable with, given that his close ally, Angela Merkel, would see it as a clear contradiction of trust?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I understand the purpose of the question, but it is based on a hypothetical on a matter that I\'m not prepared to discuss from this standpoint.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that we highly value the close working relationship we have with the Germans on a wide range of issues, but particularly on security and intelligence matters.\xc2\xa0 That cooperation is very important to the national security of the United States and our allies.\xc2\xa0 We value that partnership.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\'s built on a lot of shared trust.\xc2\xa0 It\'s built on friendship.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s built on shared values.\xc2\xa0 And we value that relationship and that\'s why we\'re going to work through this matter and ensure that it\'s resolved appropriately with the Germans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this something that came up in the conversation that the President had with Chancellor Merkel on Thursday?\xc2\xa0 And if not, has he spoken with her since then or does he have any plans to speak with her?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It did not come up in the call.\xc2\xa0 The announcement of the arrest was made by German law enforcement officials on Friday.\xc2\xa0 The call between the President and the Chancellor occurred on Thursday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he had a chance to speak with her?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 You said that the President would prepare a supplemental spending request with regard to the border situation.\xc2\xa0 Exactly how much money is he going to ask for?\xc2\xa0 Can you provide some more details about that spending request?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not prepared to offer more details about that right now.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that we\'ll have an announcement about this tomorrow, and at that point we\'ll have a lot of details about what exactly is included in that supplemental request.</p>\n<p>As you know, it\'s related to our efforts to add additional resources to the border in the form of immigration judges, ICE lawyers, asylum officials and others that can help us more rapidly and efficiently process the immigration cases that are currently backlogged as it relates to a surge that we\'ve seen at the southwest border.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with regard to the plan to either move or hire more judges to handle those situations along the border, are there concerns that you will be displacing judges from necessary work elsewhere in the country and creating backlogs elsewhere?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has talked about this a little bit already, but he\xe2\x80\x99s directed that some resources from the interior be devoted to the border region.\xc2\xa0 I know that it is a view that is shared among both Democrats and Republicans that there is work that we can do to continue to secure the border.\xc2\xa0 And processing these cases through the immigration system is a part of that.</p>\n<p>It also is a part of our commitment, this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment, to dealing with these cases in a humanitarian way; that there are due process rights that are afforded to these individuals.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for those due process rights to be respected; at the same time we should have a process that is efficient and that reflects the state of U.S. law.\xc2\xa0 This administration is committed to enforcing that law, and if we can deploy additional resources and ensure that this law is being enforced efficiently, then we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in doing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is an element of that that the President can do on his own in terms of devoting resources that already exist from the interior and sending them to the border areas.\xc2\xa0 It also is why we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking additional resources from Congress, again, to further supplement the resources that are being deployed to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to confirm, you spoke about this last week, but the President still has no plans to visit the border specifically during his trip to that part of the country later this week.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick clean-ups on this.\xc2\xa0 So what Chancellor Merkel probably had asked for is a statement from the U.S. about this.\xc2\xa0 Is what you just gave going to serve as the statement?\xc2\xa0 Or should we expect in the coming days an additional statement that actually -- I mean, I know why you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it right now from the podium -- but actually addresses some of the specific allegations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As of right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a positon to comment any further on this particular matter.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re certainly welcome to ask in the days ahead and if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional information that I can share, then I will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the announcement tomorrow about the border stuff, will that actually be the supplemental that\xe2\x80\x99s being announced?\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to come tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so all the details about how much money, in which tranches, which subcommittees or whatever, that\xe2\x80\x99s all going to be addressed then and you\xe2\x80\x99re not able to talk about it now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty detailed compilation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it goes exactly down to that level, but we will endeavor to make officials available to answer those kinds of questions when we present the supplemental request tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick 2016 question.\xc2\xa0 There was a report over the weekend suggesting that President Obama is secretly really interested in having Elizabeth Warren as the nominee and not Hillary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering whether you can address from the podium whether there\xe2\x80\x99s anything accurate to that report, or whether he plans on getting involved in choosing sides in the Democratic primary.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s still in the middle of 2014.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any particular positions or candidates or all that much thinking, to be honest with you, that the President has done as it relates to the next presidential election.\xc2\xa0 So I haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 But the President has got a very full plate in front of him right now in terms of trying to move this country forward and expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on right now.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what he will be focused on over the course of the next couple of years.\xc2\xa0 And if it gets to late 2016 and you guys want to talk presidential politics, maybe we can do that.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Last week, the President also asked for more latitude for DHS and deportations of the kids at the border. Have you gotten any signals from Senate Democrats that there is something they might be interested in doing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about the specific conversations between Senate Democrats and the White House on this particular matter.\xc2\xa0 I would expect, however, based on the public comments we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, that we should see some bipartisan support for this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is concern about the urgent humanitarian situation that we see on the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 Giving the Secretary of Homeland Security additional authority and discretion that he can use to confront that situation more efficiently, making sure that we are acknowledging the humanitarian issues that are at stake while also enforcing the law is a priority.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the priority of this administration, and if you listen to the public comments of Democrats and Republican, it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan priority.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly hopeful that when we\xe2\x80\x99re in a position to be more specific about what kind of discretion -- or maybe I should say it this way -- when we\xe2\x80\x99re in a position to be more specific about what kind of authority we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking for the Secretary of Homeland Security to be able to use to confront this situation, we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the response will be, if not unanimous, at least bipartisan in support for him getting that authority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However it is that you end up crafting that, how do you get around the fact that there are many Senate Dems who don\'t want to do any little thing without also doing comprehensive immigration reform?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that -- well, there is one reason that comprehensive immigration reform hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten done, and that\'s simply because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen House Republicans block a compromise proposal that had already passed with bipartisan support in the Senate from coming to the floor of the House for a vote.\xc2\xa0 If that common-sense bipartisan proposal that passed the Senate had got a vote in the House of Representatives we\xe2\x80\x99re confident it would pass.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we certainly are familiar and even share that sentiment that action on a comprehensive immigration reform proposal is necessary.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also necessary, though, is that we deal with this urgent humanitarian situation that\'s cropped up in the last few weeks in the form of a spike of illegal migration from Central American countries.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking is additional authority that can be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security to deal with the situation in a humanitarian way, in a way that\'s in line with our laws, which means that those who seek to stay in this country go through the due process that supported them through the immigration courts.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there is a commitment on the part of this administration to enforce the law and to make sure that everybody in this country and people in Central American countries understand that enforcing the law means that if you do not have a legal basis for remaining in this country that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be returned to your home country.\xc2\xa0 And that is also the case and that\'s also one of the reasons that we are seeking this greater authority that could be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>George, I\'m going to call on you even though your Indians took two of three from the Royals this weekend.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should have taken three.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You still get the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Following up on what you just said, you say there\xe2\x80\x99s an urgent humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 Are you not at all concerned about the optics -- the President can fly to Texas to raise political money but he can\'t go see this urgent humanitarian situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not worried about those optics, George, and that\'s simply because the President is very aware of the situation that exists on the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 Senior administration officials from the Secretary of Homeland Security to the Secretary of HHS, top CBP officials, even some senior White House officials have traveled in the last several weeks to the southwest border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What they have seen is troubling.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen this influx of illegal migration from Central America.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen, however, though, are the efforts of FEMA, working closely with DHS and HHS and the Department of Defense to set up detention facilities, to ensure that while those who were apprehended are detained in a humanitarian way.\xc2\xa0 The law requires that.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is something the administration is committed to, is enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President is well aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening along the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the wide range of steps from the authority the President already has to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get more details tomorrow on the request the President will make of the Congress to give the administration additional resources that can be used to address this problem.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s my view, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that this is unreasonable, that those who share the President\xe2\x80\x99s concern about this situation will be supportive of ensuring that the administration has the resources necessary to deal with this situation.\xc2\xa0 And those who are genuinely concerned about the border more broadly should also be strongly supportive of efforts to make an historic investment in border security, should be supportive of an effort to level the playing field for businesses who hire immigrants.\xc2\xa0 And those individuals who say that they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the border should also be supportive of the kind of compromise, common-sense bipartisan proposal that would be good for the economy and would reduce the deficit.</p>\n<p>So all of those things are contained in the common-sense proposal that passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And those who are concerned about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel this week should also be concerned about their support for a piece of legislation that would address so many of the problems that they claim to be concerned about.</p>\n<p>Viquiera.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 So when you say you want to expand the authority of the DHS Secretary to deal with this problem, I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming you mean expedite and streamline the process by which these folks can be processed.\xc2\xa0 Or do you --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To make the process more efficient.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But can you do anything about the bottom-line issues here, and that is these young people and their families, they come into the country, they cannot be turned back immediately; they essentially have to be dispersed either with family members who already live here throughout the country -- they have to be dispersed throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t expedite the process -- or can you -- to the point where they never are introduced into American society and therefore -- what, some 80, 90 percent of them never show up for their judicial hearing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, there is a -- the law requires -- this is a law -- this is an anti-trafficking law that was passed by Congress in 2008 and signed into law by the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 So we should be clear about the law that this administration is enforcing.\xc2\xa0 That law mandates how children from non-contiguous countries are treated in the immigration system.</p>\n<p>What we are seeking is for that process to be made more efficient.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of ways in which that process can be made more efficient -- some of it by exercising authority that the administration already has, and some of it by exercising authority that the Secretary of Homeland Security seeks but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have.</p>\n<p>The bottom line, though, is that the law will be enforced.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is it means that these children who have been apprehended will go through the immigration court process and if they are found to not have a legal basis for remaining in this country, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be returned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, it is fair to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that most of the kids who go through this process will not qualify -- it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that most of the kids who go through this process will qualify for humanitarian relief, which is to say that most of them will not have a legal basis -- will not be found through that court process to have a legal basis to remain in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The real-world problem is, is that many of them don\xe2\x80\x99t submit themselves to the process.\xc2\xa0 They\'re never appear in court.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s one of the reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking these detention facilities that actually can house -- that can house more children in an humanitarian way, that we can deal with this backlog more efficiently.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one of the reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking additional judges and asylum officials and ICE lawyers so that the wait is not so long, so that this whole process can run more efficiently in a way that is consistent with our values about the way that human beings should be treated, but also in a way that\'s consistent with what the immigration law requires.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re committed to fulfilling the tenets of that law, and that is likely to require some children to be sent back to their home countries.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have spoken in very clear and candid terms that parents who are considering putting their children in the hands of a criminal with only the promise that that child will be welcome with open arms in America should not do so.\xc2\xa0 The journey is dangerous and the promise is not one that can be fulfilled.\xc2\xa0 If those children do not have a legal basis for remaining in this country -- and as I mentioned, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that those children will be found to have a -- or unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll be sent home.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify, and pardon for looking at it in a different way.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying most of these children who have been in these desperate situations will be returned to their homes in Central America?\xc2\xa0 That\'s your estimation?\xc2\xa0 Because that\'s not what we heard, certainly not in that clear of a statement, from Secretary Johnson yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things about this.\xc2\xa0 First of all, there is due process, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to respect that due process.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be very careful about the way that I\xe2\x80\x99m phrasing what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying here.\xc2\xa0 Each case is specific and will be treated on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way that -- that\'s what the immigration law requires.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why again, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking additional judges and lawyers and asylum officials who can process these claims more quickly to make sure that each case is heard and given the requisite amount of attention.</p>\n<p>However, based on what we know about these cases, it is unlikely that most of these kids will qualify for humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is it means they will not have a legal basis for remaining in this country and will be returned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also know that about 600 minors were ordered deported each year from non-border states over the last decade or so.\xc2\xa0 Ninety-five were deported last year, according to records, even as this flood from Central America -- five times more than two years earlier -- has been pouring across the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 So why do you think now that more children will be sent back when at least recent indications are that that has not been the case?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because we\xe2\x80\x99ll have additional resources that we can use in the court system -- additional judges, additional lawyers, additional asylum officers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just the speed at which things will be moving?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we will do is we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to put in place a -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to add capacity to the system that will allow these claims to be processed more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Again, that is in the best interest of both those who are seeking to enforce the law like this administration is committed to doing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also in the best interest of the humanitarian concerns that many people have about the treatment of these children.\xc2\xa0 So additional resources will allow these cases to be processed more efficiently.</p>\n<p>The thing that\'s important for people to understand just from a policy matter is that the overall apprehensions along the border have only risen by a slight amount.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen, though, is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a significant increase in apprehensions and processing of children and individuals from Central America, that there\xe2\x80\x99s one certain segment here that accounts for this spike.</p>\n<p>The overall levels are not that far above what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last few years.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last few years is a historic low in terms of apprehensions at the border.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about outside of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about -- in terms of the broader border security situation, we remain near the historic lows that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been at for the last several years.</p>\n<p>There is, however, a spike in this specific population.\xc2\xa0 And we would like Congress to give the administration additional resources to deal with these cases more efficiently, while respecting the basic due process rights that each of these individuals has.</p>\n<p>But in terms of enforcing the law against adults who are apprehended at the border, or even adults with children that are apprehended at the border, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed either.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that the efficiency of that enforcement process has also improved, and that the bottom line is this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to enforcing the law at the same time that we respect the basic humanitarian needs of those who are apprehended.</p>\n<p>Let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Nadia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what do you make of the video over the weekend where the head of the Islamic State of Iraq, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, appeared to be speaking to his followers in Mosul, which is the second largest city in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Is he challenging the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 And what does it say about your cooperation with the Iraqi government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports of that video, Nadia.\xc2\xa0 We have not at this point been able to determine the authenticity of that video.\xc2\xa0 So that is something that\'s currently being reviewed by the intel community and by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Since that video has not been authenticated, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on it at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another related matter, ISIL mounted an attack across the -- in Yemen, across the Saudi border.\xc2\xa0 You have been cooperating with the Yemeni government over the years, especially with the drone attack.\xc2\xa0 What does it say now about this new attack since the President says that al Qaeda leaders are on the run?\xc2\xa0 Are you reviewing your assessment of their ability now, especially in Yemen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have not actually seen the reports of the situation that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to follow up with you on that matter.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 There are only a few legislative days left until next month, and the Highway Trust Fund is going to be running out of money.\xc2\xa0 Is there a proposal on Capitol Hill that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen to pay for that, to replenish that fund?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the proposal that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that I like the best is the one that was put forward by this administration. It is a common-sense proposal that certainly deserves the kind of bipartisan support that unfortunately is all too rare in Washington these days.</p>\n<p>The proposal put forward by the administration, as you know, Cheryl, involves closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well connected.\xc2\xa0 And closing those loopholes generates some revenue that could then be used to invest in the kind of infrastructure that benefits everybody -- those at the top, and middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 It also would create a lot of jobs and would support a lot of jobs that are at risk if the trust fund itself is threatened.</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of reasons that what we put forward is a common-sense proposal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to reviewing other proposals that others may put forward.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of how we think this important piece of business should get done, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what we think is the proper path forward.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, one bit of housekeeping on the budget request on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Is it only going be immigration?\xc2\xa0 Or there\xe2\x80\x99s talk on the Hill about dealing with wildfires.\xc2\xa0 The President has asked for money as well to battle terrorism overseas, these terrorism partnership funds, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Is this only immigration?\xc2\xa0 Or --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it will include some of these other things, as well, I believe.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly said this morning that the administration is committed to enforcing the law --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the immigration situation.\xc2\xa0 If that\'s the case, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t your Homeland Security Secretary say that?\xc2\xa0 When asked repeatedly on NBC yesterday, he could not say what you said.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the Homeland Security Secretary was very clear about is our commitment to enforcing the law and making sure --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was asked that four times, and he kept talking about other options.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He was asked very directly about whether or not this administration is committed to enforcing the law, and that\'s exactly what we are doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David Gregory:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cAre they going to be deported or not? Will most of these children we see in this situation be returned to their homes?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The Secretary:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a deportation proceeding that has commenced against illegal migrants, including children.\xc2\xa0 We are looking at ways to create additional options for dealing with the children in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What are those additional options?\xc2\xa0 Is he enforcing the law or just looking for other options?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Ed, what the 2008 law requires, it requires some very specific handling of children who are apprehended on the border, who originated in Central American countries.\xc2\xa0 And so when he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about additional options, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about more efficiently processing them through the system.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases that means sending them back to their home country.</p>\n<p>As I pointed out, that once they go through the immigration system, it is our view that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that most of those kids will qualify for humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for that humanitarian relief and don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legal basis for remaining in this country, they will be sent back.\xc2\xa0 Nobody should make any mistake about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you react when a Democratic congressman, Henry Cuellar, from Texas said yesterday that he thinks the President, the White House has been one step behind and you should have known months ago that this crisis was developing, and basically suggested you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done anything?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This administration has been very proactive as we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with this situation.\xc2\xa0 We have increased the amount of resources that are currently deployed to our immigration system to more efficiently process the cases by adding judges and lawyers and asylum officials.\xc2\xa0 We can more effectively and efficiently process these claims.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also opened up detention facilities to make sure that those adults who arrive in this country that are accompanied by children have a place where they can stay while their immigration process is playing out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we have improved our efficiency when it comes to apprehending adults at the border, quickly processing their immigration claims, and in most cases sending them back to the country where they originated as well.</p>\n<p>So this administration has been working proactively to deal with what I think everybody acknowledges is a very difficult situation with the idea in mind that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to both respect the basic humanitarian needs of those who show up on our southwestern border, but also to enforce the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that question of proactivity, though, the Department of Homeland Security had a contract to bid out as early as January of this year looking for escorts to help unaccompanied minors.\xc2\xa0 If the administration back in January had a contract out there looking for escorts to help these kids, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest the administration knew there was a wave coming and was not actually proactive if this contract was out there, but yet you still had the problem developing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For questions about the contract, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99d check with DHS.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Senator Johnson from Wisconsin, as you know, has had this lawsuit out there pressing you on the health care law, suggesting that lawmakers of both parties and staffers should not have subsidies under the new health care law.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s getting a hearing in Wisconsin today.\xc2\xa0 In addition to that, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had Speaker Boehner, the President has pushed back on him in terms of his separate lawsuit dealing with executive actions.\xc2\xa0 When you see this lawsuit potentially going forward on health care, how do you react to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there are even some Republican members of Congress who articulated that they both don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the lawsuit that Senator Johnson has put forward, and they also don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Senator Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the law is consistent with their interpretation of the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I know that there is some Republican disagreement about the wisdom of the lawsuit that Senator Johnson is pursuing.\xc2\xa0 What the President believes is that the whole goal of the Affordable Care Act in the first place was to lower health care costs, to expand access to quality, affordable health insurance for every American, including those who were employed by small businesses.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what those goals are.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that there may be some like Senator Johnson who don\xe2\x80\x99t share those goals.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But our efforts to enforce this law and to implement this law in a way that maximizes benefits for the American people and expands access to health care is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward on.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken repeatedly about due process, but it also sounds as if you\xe2\x80\x99ve prejudged the due process outcome.\xc2\xa0 Could you address that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It would be inaccurate to interpret the comments that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made here as an effort to prejudge that process.\xc2\xa0 We are committed to the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned I think to Chris, it is important that each of these cases is adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, evaluating the specific claims of individuals who have been apprehended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, our general knowledge about those children from Central America that have appeared at the border in rising numbers over the law few weeks -- that our knowledge, again, as a general matter of those cases, indicates that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that the majority of those children will qualify for humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is just our effort to convey to you as much information as we have about this situation.\xc2\xa0 It is in no way an effort to prejudge the due process that each of these individuals is entitled to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be a practical or even indirect effect on those who are heading to the border to carry out these due process procedures to hear from the podium that -- before they even heard most of them won\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for humanitarian relief?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I think that the people that are being sent to deal with this problem are highly trained professionals that have a lot of experience in this case law, and that they will look very carefully at the specific claims of each of these individuals and they will carry out those proceedings in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>That is the instruction that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received from the President and from the Secretary of Homeland Security, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have the high expectation that they will do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Setting aside whether the President goes to the border, is he prepared to say what you have said this morning and let those who might be considering this as an option in Central America know, don\xe2\x80\x99t come because you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to be sent back and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to enforce the law?\xc2\xa0 I mean, as directly as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said it here this morning?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was pretty direct when he was asked about this 10 days or so ago in an interview with Mr. Karl\xe2\x80\x99s network.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he would enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 You said something different.\xc2\xa0 You said that most of these cases won\xe2\x80\x99t qualify.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that what he said was he said, don\xe2\x80\x99t send your children here, and then he went on to explain why that was the case.\xc2\xa0 And that explanation is in line with our laws.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- I mean, the other thing that the President highlighted -- and this is important as well -- the President highlighted that what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is a very dangerous journey.\xc2\xa0 In many cases, this is a journey that is being led by criminal networks that are seeking only to prey upon those who live in increasingly desperate situations.</p>\n<p>That is deplorable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that the administration is also seeking greater authority to crack down on some of those criminal networks.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, Congress will give us the ability to enforce the law against those criminal networks as well by handing out even stiffer punishments for those who are caught preying on those in a particularly vulnerable state.</p>\n<p>But our commitment here to enforcing the law and the candid message that is being delivered to families throughout Central America is that they should not entrust their children in the hands of a criminal on the promise they\xe2\x80\x99ll be welcomed in the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When Julie was asking you about Chancellor Merkel saying if these allegations are true, you volunteered and said, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big \xe2\x80\x9cif.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 To my ears, that sounded like a qualified denial.\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just deny or say what you --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what it was.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what it was.\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, what was it then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was an observation about her question, which is that it was predicated entirely on a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Not that it was an unreasonable question, but just that it was predicated on a hypothetical.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, what she was quoting you was the Chancellor of Germany saying, if this is true, it would constitute a breach and of her understanding of a relationship with this country\xe2\x80\x99s government.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a hypothetical, that\xe2\x80\x99s a statement from the German Chancellor.\xc2\xa0 And then you said that\xe2\x80\x99s a big \xe2\x80\x9cif.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s the context of the big \xe2\x80\x9cif.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Because it sounded like what you were saying is these allegations are unlikely to be proven true.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not at all what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 That is an assumption based on my effort to be as candid as possible with Julie.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on this matter at all for the reasons that I cited earlier.\xc2\xa0 This is an intelligence matter and this is a matter that is under investigation by German law enforcement authorities.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on it from here.</p>\n<p>As it relates to our relationship with Germany, it is a relationship that is highly valued by this country and this administration for a whole variety of reasons, including the solid cooperation and partnership that we have when it comes to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s national security and our intelligence network.\xc2\xa0 So we value that strong working relationship, and that is why we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to making sure that we resolve this issue with the Germans appropriately.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, we had an immigration judge on last week who said that in some cases the deportation hearing for these unsupported minors can take years because of the backlog.\xc2\xa0 And presumably, word of that is also making its way back to Central America.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that undermining the President and the Vice President when they try to tell parents, don\xe2\x80\x99t put your kids on this dangerous journey?\xc2\xa0 I mean, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s two, three years they are, in fact, being welcomed to the United States.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is not the -- let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 That is one of the reasons, again, that the President has directed that additional judges, asylum officials and ICE attorneys be dedicated to dealing with the backlog of cases that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing at the border.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand is that we\xe2\x80\x99re prioritizing recent apprehensions, and that means that people who are planning to show up in the next few weeks are likely to have their cases processed pretty efficiently through the system.\xc2\xa0 Again, due process will be respected.\xc2\xa0 Basic humanitarian responsibilities that are dictated by the law but also are part of our national values will also be respected.\xc2\xa0 That means that these children, when they arrive, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be housed in a facility that\xe2\x80\x99s maintained by HHS.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But this administration is committed to enforcing the law and making sure that the immigration claims of these individuals is processed quickly through the immigration court system.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking additional judges and lawyers to make that process operate as efficiently as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do sort of \xe2\x80\x9clast in, first out\xe2\x80\x9d and they\xe2\x80\x99ll never leave?\xc2\xa0 That potentially -- trying to deal with the backlog?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit more complicated than can be described in my introduction to accounting class.\xc2\xa0 But people should understand that those cases will move efficiently through the system, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking additional resources, so we can both whittle down that backlog but also address the basic due process claims of those who have recently arrived at the border.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, and are you also trying to avoid the situation where the minors are released to family members?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, when those -- it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that when those releases take place it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the backlog, and so we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to both trim the backlog but also to prioritize the handling of those more recent arrivals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, have you been able to get an answer for me yet as to how many of those that are released with the promise of returning to a court date are actually showing up for their hearing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific number in front of me, Jon.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of things --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking this for a couple weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason why you can\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But there are a couple of things that are important for you to understand.\xc2\xa0 The first is, is that if I did have that number here, it would not necessarily give you an accurate picture of what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening.\xc2\xa0 Because what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this recent surge just in the last few weeks of recent arrivals.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, because the backlog is rather lengthy, the notice to appear is, in some cases, a rather lengthy period of time.\xc2\xa0 So that would not -- those who are given a notice to appear but did not appear for their court date, that might not necessarily give you a very accurate picture of what exactly is happening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty small number, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, not many are showing up for their hearings, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the number in front of me, Jon, but what we have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you characterize it?\xc2\xa0 Or is it closer to 10 percent than 100 percent?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what the number would illustrate, if I had it in front of me, it would illustrate that the court system is not operating as efficiently as we would like it to, particularly in light of the recent surge at the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking additional resources to whittle down that backlog to more efficiently deal with those who have been recently apprehended, and making sure that we are enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the L.A. Times filed a Freedom of Information Act request and got some of the numbers for previous years, and it showed that back in 2008 there were more than 8,000 minors who were sent back, who were deported.\xc2\xa0 And last year, that number had fallen to less than 2,000.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was almost a fifth of what it had been.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that show that what you were saying is disinformation when the smugglers promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to stay?\xc2\xa0 I mean, effectively, this administration has not really been deporting minors in any significant numbers.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, Jon, what\xe2\x80\x99s important is the difference between 2008 and the more recent statistics that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing is the passage of that law by Congress in 2008 that was signed into law by the previous President.\xc2\xa0 And what that law mandated was a difference in the way that children who arrive in this country from non-contiguous countries are treated in the immigration system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the numbers that you cite reflect, or at least are the consequence of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s consistent commitment for enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 What we are seeking is greater authority for the Secretary of Homeland Security to exercise some discretion that would allow him to make that process more efficient, and in some cases more quickly and promptly remove some children from this country if it is found that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- that they don\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So understanding those numbers that were presented in the Times this morning requires someone to take into account what the enforcement of the law requires.\xc2\xa0 And what that law required was a longer process for adjudicating the cases of these children from non-contiguous countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the bottom line is -- what it shows is that minors that are coming into this country illegally, by and large, have been able to stay because there have been so few deportations.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you may blame it on the law, others may blame it on lax enforcement.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not blaming it on the law.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m merely citing that this is what the law requires.\xc2\xa0 There are some suggestions from our opponents that the problem here is the President is not enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, the President is enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 And what we are seeking is greater authority to more effectively enforce that law that would allow the administration to act more quickly in some cases to return children from the country where they originated if it\xe2\x80\x99s found that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legal standing for remaining here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could I ask -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a question on another subject.\xc2\xa0 If you can remind me that the President\xe2\x80\x99s tweets -- those tweets that go out under @BarackObama, I understand those that aren\xe2\x80\x99t signed BO are not directly written by him.\xc2\xa0 Does he even read the others?\xc2\xa0 Does he know they\xe2\x80\x99re going out?\xc2\xa0 Are they reviewed by senior people at the White House?\xc2\xa0 Or is that just simply OFA doing something on his behalf that he\xe2\x80\x99s not even --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I suspect you\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask me about a tweet from @BarackObama that I may not have seen, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to give you some insight into the process, which is that the @BarackObama Twitter handle is maintained by OFA -- that is the political organization that was the offshoot of the campaign.\xc2\xa0 And that is a Twitter handle that is maintained independent of the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so the tweet I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you about --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, good, I knew that was coming.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is after the Hobby Lobby decision, it did a throw-back Thursday tweet to throw back to last week when a woman, not her boss, made her own decisions about her health care.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that, because of the Hobby Lobby decision, that women are not allowed to make their own decisions about their health care unless they consult with their boss?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly true of women in some cases, and that\'s the concern that this administration has, that what the Supreme Court ruling -- the consequence of that Supreme Court ruling is it will allow bosses to interfere with what the President believes should be the freedom that any woman has to make her own decisions about her health care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he was aware of that tweet, as far as you know?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if he was aware of that tweet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you aware of that tweet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, because it was -- because the Twitter handle is maintained independent of the White House, I was not aware of it.</p>\n<p>But it sounds like based on your description that it is consistent with a priority that the President and this administration have attempted to advance, which is that women should have the freedom to make their own decisions about their health care without interference from their boss.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An Iraq question.\xc2\xa0 The administration made it clear from the very beginning during this latest crisis that the priority is for the Iraqis to form an inclusive national government.\xc2\xa0 We heard overnight that the Iraqi parliament is not even going to reconvene until August 12th, which is more than a month from now.</p>\n<p>By all accounts, the process of government formation is paralyzed.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration satisfied with the efforts so far of Iraqi leaders to overcome these sectarian issues?\xc2\xa0 And what else can the United States do to prod along that process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty candid I think over the last couple of weeks in articulating our disappointment that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders have not been able to move more quickly to unify that country.\xc2\xa0 That nation faces an existential threat from ISIL right now.\xc2\xa0 And to confront that threat, the country will need to be united.\xc2\xa0 This is a message that\'s been delivered by a range of senior administration officials, particularly the Vice President who has spent a lot of time on the phone with political leaders in that country.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that that is a necessary step.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear that the President has made clear that additional military involvement will only be done in coordination with tangible commitments from Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to pursue a more inclusive governing agenda.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is that this existential threat that\'s posed by ISIL certainly has a security dimension to it, but it only highlights the degree to which Iraq is vulnerable to sectarian divisions.\xc2\xa0 And it will require Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders from each of these major communities in Iraq -- the Shia, the Sunni, and the Kurds -- to put aside those sectarian divisions, to put aside their own political ambitions in some cases, and put the interest of the country first.</p>\n<p>And we are urging Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to do that, and quite frankly to do that more than they have in the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems as if they\'re going in the opposite direction.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden calls, and rather than move up their date for convening parliament, they\'re moving it back.\xc2\xa0 So are they brushing aside what your urgent advice is?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some constructive words from other leading members of Iraq society.\xc2\xa0 We saw a representative of the Grand Ayatollah Sistani comment and urge Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to do the same thing that this administration has been urging them to do.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen other countries in the region urge Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to come together and unify that country.\xc2\xa0 So I think that there is widespread agreement in the region and around the world that the way in which this problem can be solved is pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 It will require difficult steps.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think anybody has tried to minimize -- I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t tried to minimize the difficulty of making these kinds of decisions and reaching these kinds of agreements.</p>\n<p>But to be blunt about it, reaching those agreements and making those difficult decisions are necessary for Iraq to survive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I was talking last week to the other Josh from Missouri, Josh Hawley, who was the co-counsel in the Hobby Lobby case.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a Cardinals fan, by the way.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, that\'s unfortunate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he noted that there are 50 other cases pending that involve nonprofits, such as Little Sisters of the Poor, Wheaton College and others.\xc2\xa0 And he said that the President, with the stroke of a pen -- his words -- could set aside all these cases with a new executive order that would either circumvent, using -- strong language the previous executive order on health care that\'s caused all the cases, or designate third parties such as the government or an insurer to handle health care in which abortion-inducing contraceptives are involved.\xc2\xa0 He said it would end all cases.\xc2\xa0 Your comment on that?\xc2\xa0 And is the President considering an executive order?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our belief, John, for handling this situation is that Congress *the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby decision struck down one part of a statute that was passed by both Houses of Congress and signed into law by the President.\xc2\xa0 So our view about the best way to resolve this situation is for Congress to pass a law.</p>\n<p>I am not na\xc3\xafve about the difficulty that Congress has in taking steps like this, but in this particular matter our first priority for resolving the situation is the passage of a new law through Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no executive order.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I said was our first priority is for Congress to take action, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we would like to see.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about the core of the immigration problem right now concerning this group of kids is problems in their home countries, but really the problem for our country is that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to get past the border and this law that\xe2\x80\x99s in place that caters specifically to them.\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that that is our problem right now?\xc2\xa0 That that\xe2\x80\x99s our root cause of the humanitarian crisis that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if we could enjoy some success and cooperation from some of these Central American countries that would stem the tide at the source, that certainly would be a benefit to our country.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in some pretty intensive diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen just in the last couple of weeks both the Vice President and the Secretary of State traveled to that region to meet with leaders of those countries to try to deal with the situation there.</p>\n<p>That involves increasing funding for some USAID programs that would promote community development and in some cases even set up repatriation centers to make it more efficient to move children who left that country back to that country.\xc2\xa0 It also involves great cooperation with law enforcement officials that we have existing law enforcement relationships that can be leveraged to improve citizen security in those countries.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in a variety of efforts, some of which are underway in the home countries of those who are seeking to travel to this one.\xc2\xa0 But it is accurate to point out that there is an urgent humanitarian situation that is in full bloom on the U.S. border, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the deployment of additional resources to try to deal with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if enforcing the law has contributed to the crisis\xc2\xa0 -- because we need to house them and deal with them through the courts -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President then advocate for changing that law?\xc2\xa0 Or does the administration see some humanitarian value in that law?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think that expanding the leeway of DHS is going to be enough?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right that this is basically a multifaceted solution that we\xe2\x80\x99re proposing.\xc2\xa0 The first is, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll always start with, the bedrock requirement that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to enforce the law as it exists.</p>\n<p>Now, what we\xe2\x80\x99re also seeking is additional authority from Congress that can be given to the Secretary of Homeland Security to exercise some discretion to more promptly remove children who it is found through the court process that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legal basis for remaining in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that law need to be changed basically?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we already know that most of the kids won\xe2\x80\x99t have that remedy within their situations anyway.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right that it is our expectation that after going through the legal process that the majority of these kids will not qualify for humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0 The law that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing is actually an anti-trafficking law.\xc2\xa0 There are some important benefits to this law.\xc2\xa0 There are some kids who are moved through trafficking networks from Asia, for example, who need to have the kind of guarantees and protections in terms of ensuring that due process is followed.\xc2\xa0 So that law is important.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut in light of this recent surge that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Central American countries, there is additional authority that could be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security that would allow us to enforce that law more effectively in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of this country but also in the best interest of those children.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And, sorry, last question -- the supplemental request, will that include a piece for border security at all, or is this all remedy once they\xe2\x80\x99re past the border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the supplemental request that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking principally focuses on these immigration court resources -- judges, lawyers, prosecutors, asylum officials -- who can make sure that these cases are processed more efficiently.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The issue right now is -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reporting on many of your networks and outlets that a lot of these individuals who are traveling from Central American countries aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily seeking to get through the border; in fact, they\xe2\x80\x99re seeking out Border Patrol officers so that they can be detained and go through the immigration system.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are interested in making sure that we have the additional resources in place in the immigration system to process those claims more quickly, and in most cases, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about adults, that they can be returned to their home country more quickly.</p>\n<p>For those who are concerned about border security -- and I saw that there were a couple of Republicans who were rather forceful in their advocacy for increased border security on a couple of Sunday morning programs -- the fact of the matter is, comprehensive immigration reform that passed through the Senate, has being blocked by Republicans in the House, includes a historic investment in border security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So those who claim that they are against comprehensive immigration reform, but yet are committed to criticizing the President for his lack of effort to secure the border, are open to have their motives questioned.\xc2\xa0 And I hope that they will be when they do additional interviews on your networks.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good Monday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:50 P.M.
