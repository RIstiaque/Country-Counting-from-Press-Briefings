(local)</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0So I just wanted to give you guys a background readout here. \xc2\xa0Upon taking off, the President called President Karzai of Afghanistan because they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to see each other. \xc2\xa0They discussed progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made by the Afghan National Security Forces. \xc2\xa0The President referenced that he\xe2\x80\x99d heard very positive readouts of the progress in his briefings with Ambassador Cunningham and General Dunford. \xc2\xa0They discussed the success of the first round of the elections and the preparations that are being made for the second round of elections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President praised the Afghan electoral institutions for the work that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, as well as the Afghan National Security Forces\xe2\x80\x99 work in securing those elections. \xc2\xa0The President also reiterated his continued support for a process of Afghan-led reconciliation that President Karzai is committed to.</p>\n<p>With respect to the BSA, the President reiterated his interest in concluding a BSA with President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s successor and agreed to stay in touch with President Karzai as we make determinations about what potential post-2014 presence could go along with a BSA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What did Karzai say about that -- the BSA?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Just that they agreed to stay in touch on it and that President Obama would be in touch before we articulate publicly any decision-making. \xc2\xa0But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s understood by both of them that [the] BSA is something that his successor would conclude; we crossed that bridge earlier in the year. \xc2\xa0And again, I think we saw good statements from both Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani in recent days about their interest in signing a BSA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any more information on how much of a heads up Karzai got? \xc2\xa0Because it seemed like from the statement you guys had with the offer for him to come to Bagram, it was basically an offer that was made so late that he would never have been able to make it anyways.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact timing of when he was notified. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s handled by the embassy. \xc2\xa0I do think -- look, in the past, President Karzai has not traveled to Bagram when we\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not our expectation that he would. \xc2\xa0He prefers to host President Obama at the palace. \xc2\xa0Again, the nature of this visit was such that we were really keeping it focused on the troops and not looking to get into Afghan politics at this time. \xc2\xa0So we weren\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, but we did want to make sure that President Obama could speak to him given his travel to Afghanistan and the briefings he got from his senior [staff].</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So they spoke after we were wheels up, right?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Right after the plane was wheels up, yes.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know about how long the call lasted?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Yes, I think the call lasted about 15 to 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And did he tell him -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I understood -- did the President tell President Karzai that he will let him know before he makes an announcement whether it\xe2\x80\x99s at West Point or whatever about the plans for residual troop numbers?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Yes, he would, as a matter of course, consult with President Karzai before publicly articulating an announcement like that.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And was this call that articulation? \xc2\xa0Or there will be another --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0This call was about having been in Afghanistan and wanting to touch base with him. \xc2\xa0And actually, the only other thing I left out is they also talked about the recent attack on the Indian Consulate in Afghanistan and the context of President Karzai also traveling to India tomorrow for Prime Minister-designate Modi\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When exactly did the President invite Karzai to Bagram?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I think the embassy extended that invitation sometime before our arrival. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact time.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When Obama had his briefing with Dunford and others, what was the conversation like about the post-2014 plan? \xc2\xa0I mean, are they still in the stage where he\xe2\x80\x99s actually getting guidance and advice? \xc2\xa0Or was it more him telling the Commander and others what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about announcing?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s both. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been getting their advice over the last few weeks. \xc2\xa0He was able to share some of his thinking. \xc2\xa0I think they really wanted to, given the context of how they see things on the ground. \xc2\xa0I think the principal message that we heard from General Dunford and Ambassador Cunningham is that there are a number of factors converging here that do make it an opportune moment for the United States to articulate its commitment -- that the Afghan National Security Forces have performed, in some respects better than we anticipated; they have moved into the lead for combat; the elections have created a sense of optimism in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s an environment in which there are some good strains that are converging that make a potential U.S. articulation of our commitment to Afghanistan worthwhile; also, the commitments from the two leading candidates. \xc2\xa0So I think their message was that different parts of this puzzle are coming together in Afghanistan in this year of transition and that there is a continued investment that the United States can make that can help the new administration in Afghanistan when it does take power to have a stable beginning.</p>\n<p>They also reviewed the ongoing security challenges that we face in Afghanistan -- how we are going about the training mission; how we are helping the Afghan National Security Forces not just build their combat force, but also be able to sustain some of the functions of a national army. \xc2\xa0So I think they covered in some detail the state of the Afghan National Security Forces and then discussed the challenges of securing the second round of the elections. \xc2\xa0The Afghans will be in the lead for that as well. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re simply providing advice and counsel on that.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99re making, does that suggest that a smaller force would be fine, like of 5,000?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, it suggests how do we focus on supporting those functions of the Afghan National Security Forces that are going to be necessary for sustainability so that not only can they serve as a combat force in the field, but how are they building out the structures and institutions of a national army, and also how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to coordinate with our allies, some of whom have also indicated a commitment to a post-2014 Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is it fair to say that short of whoever wins the election, not signing the BSA, that the zero option is off the table at this point?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If there\xe2\x80\x99s not a BSA, we will not keep troops in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0But if the BSA is signed, you guys will move forward with --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, yes, I think the President has indicated that, and you saw in his comments today that it\xe2\x80\x99s our expectation that if there is a BSA we\xe2\x80\x99d look at how -- what force structure could fulfill those missions. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to speak to in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ten thousand has been the high number that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been using. \xc2\xa0Is there -- we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use that number anymore when we talk about the range?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into numbers.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President called, or is he planning on calling on this flight either anyone in the leadership of Ukraine or in Russia? \xc2\xa0And can you talk about that?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any current calls scheduled, but I would expect that he will call at the first opportunity the newly elected President. \xc2\xa0I think, obviously, we want to monitor how they are certifying those results. \xc2\xa0What I will say is that the President was commenting about how well the election went from his perspective. \xc2\xa0Clearly, the Ukrainians turned out in significant numbers. \xc2\xa0Clearly, the message they were sending was one of national unity and a commitment to democracy. \xc2\xa0Even in some of the more difficult provinces you saw people working to vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the statements you saw after the election from leaders like Poroshenko, they underscore national unity and send very positive signals about the future of Ukraine, not just its relations with its neighbors, but in reaching out to the east. \xc2\xa0So again, I think the overarching message from the election was extraordinarily positive when you look at the difficulties of the last several weeks -- for Ukraine it\xe2\x80\x99s a turnout of those numbers and to have such a clear result. \xc2\xa0And in support of policies of national unity, inclusion, economic stabilization, I think sets a very good groundwork for our relationship with Ukraine going forward.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- was that Poroshenko got more than the 50 percent-plus one, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no run-off and they kind of move ahead, instead of being in limbo for another month or so.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Ukrainians. \xc2\xa0I do think, though, that the sense of stability in getting to work that comes from a clear election result could be extraordinarily positive. \xc2\xa0It provides some assurance and legitimacy at a time where Ukraine has been dealing with significant challenges. \xc2\xa0And again, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said is this election will settle the legitimacy question. \xc2\xa0There were questions raised by Russia and others after the Yanukovych government collapsed and he fled town. \xc2\xa0Now the people of Ukraine have spoken, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there can be any questioning the legitimacy of a result that reflects such a broad cross-section of the Ukrainian public.</p>\n<p>So I think we made clear that the United States, our European allies will be there for this new government to help them deal with some very difficult challenges -- stabilizing the economy and trying to calm this conflict. \xc2\xa0And we hope that Russia will choose to play a constructive role in respecting this result.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No calls to Putin expected?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0None expected.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anything -- any color from behind the scenes that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see, either in the hospital visit or in his interactions with troops that you want to talk about?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Like I said, the only thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say is that he -- or a couple of things. \xc2\xa0He was able to tour kind of the -- some of the operation centers. \xc2\xa0And in each place that he went he made a point of going around to each desk and shaking everybody\xe2\x80\x99s hand and thanking them. \xc2\xa0As he mentioned in his remarks, in the operation center he saw a poster of the Twin Towers, which clearly resonated with him, and he referred to the fact that, in his private remarks to the troops in those operation centers, that it reminded him of why we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When he finished those briefings and walked towards the hangar, he went through the Hall of Honor that they have there, where they have photos of the fallen from Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0So he was able to look at photos of many troops who had been lost in Afghanistan and thought that was obviously particularly profound on Memorial Day weekend to see those photos, even as he was then able to go and spend some time with the troops as well.</p>\n<p>So I think he was, as always, moved by the visit and inspired by what these troops are doing every single day on behalf of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How many soldiers was he able to meet with at the hospital?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll check that for you. \xc2\xa0The other thing he did -- he was able to give out some awards. \xc2\xa0Did we get you the background on that?</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that for you. \xc2\xa0A number of Purple Hearts and other awards. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get that for you.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Were there new awards done tonight that was part of this? \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have that.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Yes, he -- well get you what he gave out there, yes.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<div>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t1:48 A.M.
