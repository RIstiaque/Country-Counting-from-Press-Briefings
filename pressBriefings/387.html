Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:03 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joined at the briefing today by David Cohen from the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 We spent a lot of time over the last several weeks, even months, discussing the strategy that the President has put in place to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have, for understandable reasons, spent a lot of time talking about our strategy related to the military -- military airstrikes by our coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about our effort to train and supply local forces on the ground to take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about our ongoing diplomatic efforts to build a broad international coalition.</p>\n<p>But another core component of this strategy is our efforts to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing.\xc2\xa0 This is David\xe2\x80\x99s area of responsibility and expertise, and so he\xe2\x80\x99s here to give you some brief remarks at the top and to answer your questions about it.</p>\n<p>So with that, David, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get us started.</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 So what I thought I would do is briefly recap a speech that I delivered earlier today describing Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s role in leading the effort to disrupt the financing for ISIL, which is part of the, as Josh mentioned, the overall effort to disrupt, degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL.</p>\n<p>So I began by sketching the key source of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s current revenue, and noted that ISIL presents a somewhat different terrorist financing challenge for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, it has obviously amassed wealth at a pretty rapid clip.\xc2\xa0 Much of its funding, unlike sort of al Qaeda and al Qaeda-type organizations, does not come from external donations but is gathered -- internally gathered locally in the territory in Iraq and Syria where it currently operates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But nonetheless, ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financial foundations can be attacked through the application of some tried and true techniques that we\xe2\x80\x99ve developed over the past 10 years at the Treasury Department, and with some modifications on some of these approaches.</p>\n<p>So with respect to ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s sources of revenue, obviously ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s sale of oil has gotten a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 Our best understanding is that ISIL, since about mid-June, has earned approximately a million dollars a day through the sale of smuggled oil.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some progress recently in beating back ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s ability to earn money from the sale of smuggled oil, in particular due to the airstrikes that have been conducted on some of the ISIL oil refineries.</p>\n<p>Second, ISIL has earned about $20 million this year through kidnapping for ransom, through receiving ransoms to free innocent civilians, often journalists, that it has taken hostage.</p>\n<p>Third, ISIL earns up to several million dollars per month through its various extortion networks and criminal activity in the territory where it operates.</p>\n<p>And finally, as I mentioned, external donations are not right now a significant source of funding for ISIL, but it does maintain some really significant links to Gulf-based financiers, as a spate of Treasury designations we did last night -- last week, rather -- or last month, highlights.</p>\n<p>So we are leading a three-pronged effort to combat ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financial foundation, closely linked up with the other members in the U.S. government of the anti-ISIL coalition, as well as with international counterparts.</p>\n<p>So first, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on cutting off ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s funding streams.\xc2\xa0 With respect to oil, we are looking very carefully at who the middlemen are who are involved in the sale of the oil that ISIL is smuggling.\xc2\xa0 At some point, there is someone in that chain of transactions who is involved in the legitimate or quasi-legitimate economy.\xc2\xa0 They have a bank account.\xc2\xa0 Their trucks may be insured.\xc2\xa0 They may have licensing on their facilities.\xc2\xa0 There is someone who our tools, our designation tools can influence.\xc2\xa0 And so we are looking very carefully at identifying who the people are that are involved in this chain of transactions that we can apply our tools against.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we are working to turn the growing international norm against paying ransom to terrorist organizations into a reality.\xc2\xa0 This year there were two U.N. Security Council resolutions that very clearly came out and said that paying a ransom to terrorist organizations is something that no country, no member state should be involved in.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has been longstanding U.S. policy, longstanding U.K. policy, and something that we\'re trying to get our partners around the world to turn from a norm into a reality.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Third, we are looking at these external funding networks.\xc2\xa0 Although it is not currently a significant source of revenue, there is obviously a big pool of money out there that has historically funded extremist groups.\xc2\xa0 Very focused on ensuring that this does not become a more significant means by which ISIL is able to fund itself.</p>\n<p>And finally, on the crime and extortion networks, the best way to address this, again, is through the military activity and other activity on the ground to push ISIL out of the territory where it\'s currently operating.\xc2\xa0 But it does sort of play into our second line of activity, which is to prevent ISIL from gaining access to the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 So as it has funds at its disposal, it\'s critically important that it does not get access to the financial system through the bank branches that are in the territory where it\'s currently operating.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are dozens of bank branches in Iraq where ISIL is currently operating.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working closely with the Iraqis and with others around the world, both in the private financial sector and in the public sector, to ensure that ISIL is not able to gain access to the international financial system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the third line of effort is to apply sanctions against the key leaders in ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It has a relatively sophisticated, complex organizational structure.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to look to designate the leaders, designate the people who act in CFO-like capacities, as well as to designate those outside of Iraq and Syria who are providing support to ISIL.</p>\n<p>So with that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I take a few questions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Olivier, you want to start us off?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, David.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s overall net worth?\xc2\xa0 I realize that these analogies are not perfect, but do you have a sense of where they are in overall net worth?\xc2\xa0 And could you maybe give us just where they rank either in income or in overall wealth against other notable extremist groups?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that ISIL is among the best-financed terrorist organizations -- leaving aside state-sponsored terrorist organizations -- that we\xe2\x80\x99ve confronted.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you a precise figure on what its current net worth is.\xc2\xa0 But I think an important point, though, is to not confuse funding with financial strength.</p>\n<p>ISIL has massed millions of dollars in funding, but a terrorist organization\xe2\x80\x99s financial strength turns on its ability to continue to tap into funding streams, its ability to use the funds that it has, and also its expenses, ISIL, in its ambition to control large swaths of territory -- cities, towns and millions of millions of people -- has a significant expense side of its balance sheet.\xc2\xa0 And as we work to cut off its access to revenue, ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s ability to deliver even a modicum of services to the people that it\xe2\x80\x99s attempting to subjugate will be stressed.\xc2\xa0 And so its ability to continue to hold that territory against a population that in the past has shown a willingness to push back against al Qaeda-types is going to be stressed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more.\xc2\xa0 You said that external donations are not right now a significant source of revenue.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, can you put a dollar amount on what that means?\xc2\xa0 How much smaller is it than a million dollars a day from smuggling oil, or $20 million this year from ransom?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 It is smaller.\xc2\xa0 In September, we announced designations that included sanctions against a Gulf-based facilitator -- actually, a Syria-based facilitator who received $2 million from Gulf-based donors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to suggest that this is an insignificant source of financing, it\xe2\x80\x99s just in comparison to their other revenue streams right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as important to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which countries are most lenient toward paying ransoms?\xc2\xa0 And how do you approach this problem?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Look, we approach this problem by lots of quiet diplomacy, working with the countries, and making the point -- which I think is both logical and, frankly, has borne out -- which is that the payment of ransoms just encourages further hostage-taking.\xc2\xa0 And so we all have an obligation to protect our citizens.\xc2\xa0 And the best way to protect our citizens is to take away the incentive in the first place for terrorist organizations to take hostages.</p>\n<p>The U.S. policy against paying ransoms has been longstanding, and it applies across the board to any hostage-taker.\xc2\xa0 But in the context of a terrorist organization that is taking hostages, this policy has even more force, because we know that the funding that comes from the ransoms is used by these terrorist organizations to fund all of their violent activities.\xc2\xa0 And so the best way to translate what is this emerging international norm into practice is really to make the case to our partners around the world that payment of ransoms ultimately redounds to the detriment of all of our citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it mostly European nations that are lenient towards paying, or is it Gulf States?\xc2\xa0 Or who exactly?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to identify any particular countries that are involved here.\xc2\xa0 There are, as evidenced by the fact that ISIL has received $20 million or so this year in ransom payments, there are still ransoms being paid.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent on everybody and the anti-ISIL coalition and more broadly to adhere to the Security Council resolutions and to not pay ransoms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would be an example of the external funding sources that you talked about a minute ago?\xc2\xa0 An example or two?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, an example are these donor networks in the Gulf where money is collected.\xc2\xa0 There are bundlers, essentially, who collect funds and move the funds out of the Gulf into Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about -- and again, we have recently designated some individuals who are involved in this activity -- is the use of social media to solicit funds, and the ability, frankly, to move beyond sort of person-to-person fundraising and to use social media as a way to raise funds, bundle those funds, and move them out of the Gulf into Syria and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned going after the middlemen when it comes to dealing with the oil revenue generated by ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Do you know who is buying that oil ultimately?\xc2\xa0 Are there nations buying it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking into.\xc2\xa0 And our intelligence community and our partners are highly focused on identifying exactly who it is in these smuggling networks that are involved.</p>\n<p>These smuggling networks didn\xe2\x80\x99t just pop up overnight.\xc2\xa0 These are historic, longstanding smuggling networks that have been the way by which all sorts of commodities, including oil, have been traded over the years.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s different now, frankly, is that the oil that had previously moved through these smuggling networks, we now know that that oil finds its origin with ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And anyone involved in the sale of this oil is, frankly, assisting ISIL, funding ISIL.</p>\n<p>And so, in the past, if some of these people in these networks were willing to sort of turn a blind eye as to where the oil came from, that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer tenable because this oil, everybody should know, is coming from ISIL-controlled territory, and trading in this oil is just funding ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know how much money is coming from the West?\xc2\xa0 Is there any money coming out of the U.S.?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s something that my counterparts in law enforcement are carefully looking at.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any indication that there\xe2\x80\x99s any funding coming out of the West, or certainly out of the United States for ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s something where we\xe2\x80\x99re looking carefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a problem during the battle against al Qaeda during the Bush administration, that there were organizations within the United States that were targeted by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What more can you tell us, David, about the expense side of the balance sheet?\xc2\xa0 What is ISIS spending money on?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, they spend money on fighters.\xc2\xa0 They pay for their forces to some extent.\xc2\xa0 But they also attempt to deliver something approximating services, public services.\xc2\xa0 They are trying to provide electricity.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to provide water.\xc2\xa0 But recently, I think in Mosul, there has been serious problems in the delivery of electricity and delivery of water.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But one of the things that ISIL has tried to do, which is, frankly, different from terrorist organizations of a sort of prior era, is to act as if they were a real state, a real government in the area where they are controlling; so to not try to govern entirely at the point of the gun, but also through some effort to deliver services.\xc2\xa0 And so that is expensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Iraqi government\xe2\x80\x99s budget for the provinces where ISIL is currently operating for this year was well over $2 billion.\xc2\xa0 Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to suggest that ISIL is intending to deliver anything like the services the Iraqi government was intending to deliver, but that gives you an idea of sort of the scale of the expenses that ISIL, if it\xe2\x80\x99s trying to sort of pretend to be a government, would be facing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk once more about the donations they\xe2\x80\x99re getting on social media?\xc2\xa0 Are these small-dollar donations, big-dollar donations?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s all of the above.\xc2\xa0 You see these appeals on Twitter in particular from well-known terrorist financiers, ones that we\xe2\x80\x99ve designated, that have been designated at the U.N., asking for donations to be made to -- and they\xe2\x80\x99re quite explicit -- that these are to be made to ISIL for their military campaign.\xc2\xa0 And that makes the efforts of countries in the Gulf that are quite intent on preventing funding from going to ISIL -- the Saudis, for instance -- it makes their efforts more difficult, because these are appeals that are made over social media and made broadly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to go a little deeper into the expense side of the balance sheet, and in particular given what happened yesterday in Ottawa, can you give us a sense of how that funding is used, either for the influx of foreign fighters, or is there is any way in which is supports homegrown terror?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s another element of the expense side of the balance sheet, which is to bring in foreign fighters -- and there have been something like 15,000 foreign fighters that have come into Syria and Iraq over the last several years from 80 or so countries, including a dozen or so from the U.S. -- those foreign fighters -- it costs money to bring in those foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 Some of them are self-funded, but there is a serious concern that ISIL can use some of the funds it has, essentially, to pay for the fighters to come into the area, which is one of the reasons also that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on keeping ISIL out of the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 Because their ability to fund someone who wants to travel from wherever into Iraq or Syria, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously made easier if they can send a wire transfer, and more difficult if they\xe2\x80\x99re not able to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication that that money has been used with the dozen or so Americans?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any indication on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David, in your speech today, you also obviously offered condolences to Canada but mentioned that we have to remain vigilant in the face of terror.\xc2\xa0 Were you saying specifically the administration believes it was a terror attack yesterday?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, no.\xc2\xa0 I will defer to Josh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do your efforts against paying ransom extend to private companies and families who might have people taken captive?\xc2\xa0 And is that a tough argument to make?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Look, what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is, in any situation where someone is taken hostage, first and foremost making efforts to do everything in our power -- military, diplomatically, through intelligence and law enforcement channels -- to free that person.\xc2\xa0 And I think the rescue attempt that was conducted earlier this summer, an effort to free Jim Foley, was an indication of how seriously this administration takes the obligation to protect American citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, on the no ransoms policy, is making sure that we reduce and hopefully someday eliminate the incentive for these kidnappings to occur.\xc2\xa0 And we are highly focused on who it is that is receiving ransoms and who\xe2\x80\x99s involved in the solicitation of ransoms.\xc2\xa0 And those are all people who are vulnerable to our actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they include families and private companies?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Look, the bad actors here are the people who are taking the hostages --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 -- and that\'s who we\'re focused on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the preferred currency of ISIL?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I assume the preferred currency of ISIL, like the preferred currency of everyone around the world, is the U.S. dollar.\xc2\xa0 I think mostly what they have access to are Iraqi dinars.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to drill down on the million-dollar-a-day oil revenue.\xc2\xa0 You said, I think in your speech earlier, that that was from mid-June to today.\xc2\xa0 But you also said that airstrikes have started to degrade some of that.\xc2\xa0 So what I\'m wondering is, is the million-dollar constant, which represents both ISIL, gaining more sort of sources of oil revenue, but being degraded by airstrikes?\xc2\xa0 Or is it something like they were maybe making $2 million back in June but now it\'s half a million over time?\xc2\xa0 Can you just kind of explain --</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 I would say it\'s a pre-airstrike number.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t have a number for since the airstrikes have started?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, David, for your time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY COHEN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you were going to bring Hurricane and Jordan in with you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That would have made for a good photo op, wouldn\'t it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All right, I actually don\'t have any announcements at the top.\xc2\xa0 So, Darlene, do you want to get it started with questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the attack in Canada yesterday, the gunman there was said to have been a recent convert to Islam.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister described him as \xe2\x80\x9can ISIL-inspired terrorist.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I was wondering if this individual had ever been in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Had any U.S. officials been monitoring him or watching him?\xc2\xa0 And is there any reason to believe there might be some sort of similar attack planned against the U.S. -- Washington or anyplace else in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, let me start by saying that our hearts go out to the victims of the despicable terrorist attacks that occurred in Canada this week.\xc2\xa0 Canada is one of our closest allies, partners and friends in the world, and we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in solidarity.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been clear that we are grateful to Canada for its steadfast commitment to countering violent extremism wherever it occurs, whether overseas or here in North America.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to work closely with our Canadian colleagues to combat this serious threat.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Harper said it very well yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He said that the Canadian people will not be intimidated.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they will strengthen their resolve and not allow a safe haven for terrorists who seek to do harm.</p>\n<p>President Obama yesterday offered Canada any assistance that\'s necessary in responding to these attacks.\xc2\xa0 And our respective national security teams are coordinating very closely, including again today.\xc2\xa0 As the President said yesterday, when it comes to dealing with terrorist activity, it is clear that Canada and the United States have to be entirely in sync.\xc2\xa0 We have been in the past and we will continue to be in the future.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the threat that we face here, you have heard the President on a number of occasions talk about the risk that the U.S. faces from so-called lone wolves.\xc2\xa0 These are, again, individuals who, in some cases, can be radicalized over the Internet.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard David discuss the robust efforts that are underway by ISIL to use social media to recruit and radicalize people around the world.</p>\n<p>I should have preceded this aspect of my answer by saying that there continues to be an ongoing investigation in Canada, so I\'m not in a position to discuss any details about this individual that is the subject of an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 But what continues to be of continued focus here in the United States are our ongoing efforts to counter violent extremism.\xc2\xa0 It is a critical component of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism strategy.\xc2\xa0 And there was a report that was released a couple of years ago by the White House that was called, \xe2\x80\x9cEmpowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and that was a strategy where the administration at the federal level would work closely with partners at the local level to ensure that we\'re doing everything necessary to mobilize resources and counter violent extremism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That, of course, includes the use of law enforcement resources.\xc2\xa0 But this goes beyond just enhanced community policing.\xc2\xa0 This includes efforts through schools, through mental health professionals to make sure that every instrument of government can be used to work with local communities to combat this threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The administration at the federal level and at regional offices across the country has also sought to engage community leaders in this effort.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of pilot projects that are underway right now in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and in\xc2\xa0 -- I believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- actually, it\'s Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Boston, where there are federal officials who are engaged in a pilot program to work closely with local law enforcement but also with community leaders to make sure that the messages recruiting vulnerable youth to engage in violent extremism are properly countered by community leaders that have influence over young people in these communities.</p>\n<p>So this is an effort that has been ongoing for a number of years at the direction of the President.\xc2\xa0 The President himself has identified the risk of a lone wolf terrorist as something that is significant, and this is something that the President talked about before this incident in Canada.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that he talked about before we saw the emergence of ISIL as a significant threat to the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President even talked about this risk prior to the Boston bombing that occurred at the finish line of the marathon a couple of years ago.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that has long attracted the attention of the United States and the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 And the administration has laid out a very multifaceted strategy for combatting it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\'t or won\xe2\x80\x99t say whether this individual was known to U.S. authorities?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to talk about any details related to this specific individual.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the fence-jumping incident last night, Congressman Chaffetz said today that there may be some changes needed to maximize the pain of climbing over the fence.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President or the White House would agree to if it were a recommendation from one of the reviews that are currently underway of the Secret Service?\xc2\xa0 It seems like a simple solution.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess it brings to mind a variety of colorful images -- (laughter) -- to pursue an approach along the lines of what Congressman Chaffetz recommends.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, a higher fence.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, fortunately --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily a painful one, but higher.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security is working closely with the General Counsel at the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a review about the security posture around the White House.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re considering a wide range of things, including the deployment of personnel, the deployment of technology and even physical obstacles, like a fence, that are critical to protecting the First Family, the White House, and those of us who work here.</p>\n<p>That is a review that we anticipate will be completed in the next couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 That review will then be considered by an independent panel of experts that\'s been assembled by the Department of Homeland Security to ultimately make some recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the leadership of the Secret Service about what steps are necessary to strike the proper balance between the top priority, which is safeguarding the President and his family and the White House complex, while also preserving the White House\xe2\x80\x99s status as the People\xe2\x80\x99s House, as a tourist destination where thousands of Americans a day can come through the White House, tour the seat of the executive branch of government, and walk out the front door.\xc2\xa0 That is a very unique -- that is part of what makes the White House such a unique building, but it also makes for a very unique challenge to the agencies and professionals who are responsible for protecting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Is the answer still no on Ron Klain testifying at Congressman Issa\xe2\x80\x99s Ebola hearing tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is, obviously yesterday was his first day on the job, so he\xe2\x80\x99s very focused on the task in front of him.\xc2\xa0 And we have heard expressions of concern from Democrats and Republicans in Congress about the need for the federal government and the international community to deal with the very serious threat of Ebola, and we certainly would welcome expressions of bipartisan support for ongoing efforts to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to this latest fence-jumper?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did not have the opportunity to speak to him.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll share with you my own observations, however, if you\'re interested.\xc2\xa0 What I took note of is the way in which yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s incident underscores the professionalism of the men and women of the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who literally at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice are prepared to spring into action to protect the White House, to protect the First Family, and to protect those of us who work here every day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is not [sic] a difficult task.\xc2\xa0 There is obviously no margin for error.\xc2\xa0 It is a task that they approach with seriousness and professionalism.\xc2\xa0 And again, because I\'m speaking for myself but I know it\'s a sentiment that is shared by the First Family, we\'re very appreciative of their efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Canada, when the President said there should be renewed vigilance, what exactly was he talking about?\xc2\xa0 And if you could say, what assistance are we providing the Canadians?\xc2\xa0 Have they asked for anything yet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steve, the communications between the federal government here in the United States and Canada have principally been led by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there is a significant U.S. diplomatic presence in Ottawa that I understand is not that far from where the violence occurred yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So there is a robust structure in place to lead those communications and ensure that offers of assistance reach their destination.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But based on the fact that the Canadian officials have determined that this is a terrorist incident, you can expect -- you should expect that U.S. officials who are responsible for our counterterrorism efforts have also been in touch with their counterparts in Canada to offer assistance and to coordinate both in the investigation and in any needed response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So \xe2\x80\x9crenewed vigilance,\xe2\x80\x9d what did the President mean?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he meant a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is, as he mentioned and as I mentioned today, there continues to be extremely strong counterterrorism coordination between the United States and Canada.\xc2\xa0 We value that strong working relationship.\xc2\xa0 That strong working relationship enhances the security of the American people and the Canadian people.\xc2\xa0 And there is a high priority that\'s placed on ensuring that that relationship continues to be strong, and we\'re going to continue to reinforce our efforts to ensure that that\'s the case.</p>\n<p>The second thing -- and I think this may be more directly about what the President was referring to -- are our ongoing efforts to counter violent extremism; that the risk that is posed by a lone wolf terrorist is something that has been of significant concern to the President for many years now, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy that we have put in place that goes beyond just enhanced community policing, but that efforts can be made at the grassroots level in communities across the country to counter the violent messages that are being sent by ISIL and other ideological extremists to try to recruit vulnerable youth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there is a very important role for the mainstream Muslim community in this country and around the world to play in this effort as well, that there are respected religious figures who can effectively counter the extremist messages that are being widely distributed in an effort to appeal to the youth in some communities both in this country but in countries around the world.</p>\n<p>And the Obama administration has made it a priority to engage these local leaders and mobilize them in this effort.\xc2\xa0 We\'re pleased with the kind of strong partnership that\'s been established in a number of communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s important for us to continue to be vigilant both about the threat, but also about our ongoing efforts to counter it.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of the social media aspect of this, is there anything more that the administration can do?\xc2\xa0 Obviously you want to respect First Amendment rights, but is there anything more you can do to crack down on these social media efforts that ISIS is using to recruit people in the West?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the question that you raise does raise some constitutional questions.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'d refer you to the Department of Justice that may have some more insight into what that -- how best to counter those messages while also protecting the First Amendment rights of Americans.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter, there are a couple of things I can say about that.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be solely about essentially shutting off the message that\'s coming from another country.\xc2\xa0 What also is effective is lifting up the message of, in this case, mainstream Muslims that have an interpretation of Islam that is much more in line with the vast majority of those who practice that religion.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 And that is part of why -- an important part of why we have worked so hard to engage community leaders in cities across the country, particularly in the Muslim community, and that there are Muslim religious leaders that share the administration\xe2\x80\x99s concern about youths in their community being targeted and recruited by violent extremism.\xc2\xa0 And there is a natural overlap where we can work closely with them to make sure that they have the resources and opportunity to make sure that their voice is heard in this situation as well.\xc2\xa0 Because I think that many of these youths will find those voices and those messages similarly persuasive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are leaders in the Muslim-American community doing enough?\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to see them do more to make sure that message gets across?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for everybody to do more to ensure that we are succeeding in this effort.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that said, we have been very gratified by the kind of response that we have seen from mainstream Muslim religious leaders across the country.\xc2\xa0 Again, these are leaders of communities who understand that there are youths in their communities who are being targeted by extremists around the world, and they are concerned about the wellbeing of the people in their community, particularly children and young adults.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like this gunman in Canada tried to leave the country or maybe wanted to leave the country, but his passport was pulled at one point.\xc2\xa0 It sounds as if this concern about foreign fighters may not come into play in every case, in every scenario, because you don\'t necessarily have to travel in all of these cases.\xc2\xa0 Some of these folks can be radicalized in their own communities.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the details about this individual are still under investigation, so I\'m not in a position to confirm some of reports that I also have seen about his attempts to travel --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Passport --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- or his passport, or whatever.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re right that based on what has been reported, this individual would be in a different category than a foreign fighter, right?\xc2\xa0 The foreign fighter threat that we have identified are individuals who have already traveled to the region and could return home to carry out acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 But there has been, long before even ISIL emerged on the international scene, a concern about the risk that\'s posed by individuals who live in communities in the West, become radicalized or even self-radicalized through social media, and carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>And again, this is a scourge that has struck this country as well.\xc2\xa0 The Boston bombing I think is a recent high-profile example of that.\xc2\xa0 And this is a threat that is very difficult to counter, because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about individuals that are inherently cut off from some of the other connections to society that the rest of us I think take for granted.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working so hard to work closely with the leaders in these communities to try and spot these problems on the front end -- because, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the government as well as the leaders of these communities to try to protect at-risk youth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been some talk about having a CVE summit here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Has any progress been made towards scheduling that or having that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is something that has been a subject of extensive discussion here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make in terms of the status of our ongoing planning on that, but I hope to have an update on that soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m taking too much time, but getting back to the fence-jumper -- do you agree, though, that what happened last night, not only the good work of the men and women of the Secret Service but of the dogs, the canine units of the Secret Service --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that this was an example of lessons that were learned from the previous incident in September, and you saw an improvement in the performance of the Secret Service last night?\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair assessment?\xc2\xa0 You may not want to say \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement\xe2\x80\x9d because they may not want to hear it that way.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would say is, for -- it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to talk about this without talking about the security posture that\xe2\x80\x99s in place.\xc2\xa0 And there still is an investigation about what exactly transpired last night, but I do think it would be fair for anyone to conclude that the results of last night\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were better than the results that related to the incident that occurred last month here.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can you say that when you put up an extra perimeter of security after what happened last month and the guy still gets over?\xc2\xa0 He was unarmed, but he could have certainly been armed, he could have been much more dangerous than he was.\xc2\xa0 So why are we all happy about that?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good that they got him, I guess, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody concerned that he got over in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I share your assessment that it\xe2\x80\x99s good that we got him.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a courageous stand.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a cold-hearted, clear-eyed assessment of the situation, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to deliver from here.</p>\n<p>But look, there is an ongoing review of the security posture at the White House, and if there are additional steps that can be taken to improve the security posture at the White House, to more effectively repel individuals who might be seeking to jump the fence, then that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that will be considered as a part of that review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another row of bicycle racks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make any -- unlike Congressman Chaffetz, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the security posture to the experts who will make their own determination about what would be an appropriate measure to safeguard the White House while at the same time balancing that with the need to ensure that people understand that the White House is something that is accessible to the public.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a place that thousands of tourists visit on a daily basis, that there is a free-speech zone that can be a pretty colorful place right out in front of the White House, most days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still accessible, clearly.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still a place that hundreds of us show up to work at every day.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of precautions that the Secret Service takes both to ensure our safety but also to ensure that we can get in and out of the complex in a relatively efficient manner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a lot of competing priorities here.\xc2\xa0 The number-one priority, however, is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the First Family and the broader complex, and I think those -- that will continue to be the priority of the Secret Service moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody surprised that last night\xe2\x80\x99s jumper was able to make it over the fence despite the extra precautions taken?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, in terms of the security posture that\xe2\x80\x99s in place and the risk that this individual may have posed to the complex, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on security, I just want to talk about Canada.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of debate in Congress, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of conversation within the administration about the southern border, and rightly so.\xc2\xa0 But what does the administration think about -- and are there any steps you\xe2\x80\x99re taking to make sure the northern border is secure, especially in light of what happened yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, we do have a very important counterterrorism partnership with the Canadians, and we work very closely with them to ensure the safety and security of our two populations.\xc2\xa0 And that includes making sure that the border between our two countries is properly monitored, and in a way that protects the citizens on both sides of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, last year the administration freed about 2,200 people from immigration jails.\xc2\xa0 And at the time, we were told by Jay Carney and other officials that the reason we were going to save a lot of money and that the people who were freed did not have major criminal records.\xc2\xa0 And USA Today has now gotten some of those records and published a story saying that most of the people that were released did not have criminal records -- that\xe2\x80\x99s true -- but some of them had very, very serious criminal records -- charges of kidnapping, sexual assault, drug trafficking, homicide.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any regrets about telling the Congress, telling the public that we\xe2\x80\x99re not releasing people with serious criminal records, and it turns out some of those people were charged with sexual assault and very serious crimes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the individual cases of those who were mentioned in that report.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that the administration continues to place a priority in ensuring that the American public is protected and is safe.\xc2\xa0 And that has been a top priority of the immigration reform policy that this administration has pursued, that strengthening --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how can the public trust you saying that when several months ago Jay Carney said, don\'t worry about it, we\'re not releasing anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Time and time again, we\'ve talked about why we believe it\'s important for us to increase security resources at the border to protect the border.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked a lot about how we believe that the deportation policy in this country should be focused on those individuals that pose a risk to the community.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue to be the focal point of our efforts.</p>\n<p>Again, I\'m not in a position to discuss individual cases, however.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple short ones on midterms, to wrap up.\xc2\xa0 In Atlanta, the President -- among the African American radio stations that you have mentioned the President would be talking to ahead of the midterms, he did an interview with an Atlanta station where he said if Michelle Nunn wins that race, the Democrats are going to keep the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, usually the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it that specific.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\'s pushing for votes in important -- but I guess I\'m trying to get at, is that just a device to turn people out in that particular race, or does the President really believe that that is the pivotal race?\xc2\xa0 That if the Democrats win that seat, they keep control of the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is mindful of the electoral map and understands what will be required to elect enough Democratic senators, reelect enough Democratic senators or to elect enough Democratic candidates --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a whole series of these races that are very pivotal --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, if we win this one we keep it.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just trying to understand, is that just kind of an election-year, hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s win?\xc2\xa0 Or does the White House really believe that\'s the one?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the message that the President was trying to deliver, Ed, is that the challenge facing Democratic candidates in a state like Georgia, where Democrats on the statewide ticket at least in Georgia have faced a pretty difficult electoral environment over the last generation or so, that what he -- the observation that he\'s making is that even in a difficult environment like Georgia that a Democratic candidate can prevail, that that might be an indication that Democratic candidates in other races are faring well, too, in environments where there is a stronger track record, at least recently, of electing more Democrats to statewide offices.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 A state right near there where there is another important race is North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 The Democratic senator, Kay Hagan, was asked in an interview about the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, and she said that he\xe2\x80\x99s been late to the game on a whole range of issues.\xc2\xa0 She mentioned Ebola and the CDC, and was pressed -- you know, are you saying he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown leadership on some of these issues -- a strong leadership -- and she said, certainly there are issues that I think certainly not, that he has not shown strong leadership.\xc2\xa0 I know that there have been candidates, it\'s old news that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been distancing themselves, but for a Democratic senator to say a Democratic President has not shown strong leadership -- how do you react to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I react to that I think by saying that Senator Hagan is somebody that has a track record and credentials for getting results for the people of North Carolina, even if it means criticizing members of her own party, even it means criticizing the leader of her own party.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a testament to her character and leadership and her commitment to serving the people of North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I necessarily agree with her assessment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That may be what it says about Hagan.\xc2\xa0 What does it say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it says about the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership is that he takes all these responsibilities very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at the situation related to responding to Ebola, to putting in place measures that are driven by his administration to counter violent extremism, that there are a whole range of threats that the President takes very seriously, has worked assiduously to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>Steven.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is there any concern here at the White House that the two attacks in Canada this week will in any way weaken the resolve of the Canadians in the fight against ISIS or al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I would take Prime Minister Harper at his word when he says that the Canadian people will not be intimidated.\xc2\xa0 And I think he delivered that message pretty forcefully.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly have valued the contribution that the Canadians have made to our broader international coalition, and that was a message that was very well received by the President and by the American people.\xc2\xa0 And it is indicative of the kind of strong relationship that endures between the United States and Canada, and it will certainly be on full display as our friends and allies in Canada are going through this very difficult time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask another question about the midterms and about Georgia, specifically.\xc2\xa0 The state Democratic --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A lot of interest in that race.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well -- the state Democratic Party there this week apparently sent out mailers with pictures of preschool-aged kids with signs that read: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\'t Shoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 These mailers I guess are meant to ramp up, turnout of African American voters.\xc2\xa0 On the backs it says, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to prevent another Ferguson in their future, vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree that if African Americans don\'t come out in large numbers this fall that there will be more Fergusons?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steven, I haven\'t seen the specific mailer in question and I\'m not sure what was motivating the individual who may have put it together, so I\'m going to withhold comment on it.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I have three subjects I want to hit you with fast.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the jumper last night, aesthetically -- you talked about there could be some changes.\xc2\xa0 Aesthetically, should we expect to see some changes?\xc2\xa0 I.e., the fence that surrounds the White House has been in question ever since we\'ve been hearing most recently with these jumpers.\xc2\xa0 Could we indeed see something aesthetically change once this review is complete?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s possible.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the subject of this ongoing review by the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 I will just say that these officials, as they conduct this review, are mindful of the need to balance what is obviously the top priority, which is the safety and security of the First Family and the White House complex, with the need to preserve public access to the White House because it is the seat of the executive branch of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>So I think the point is, it certainly would be possible to build a multi-story, bomb-proof wall around the 18-acre complex of the White House, but that I don\'t think would be striking the appropriate balance that I described earlier.\xc2\xa0 So this is the subject of an ongoing review, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the professionals determine both what is necessary to protect the First Family, but also what is necessary to balance these other important priorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the balance could be a fence with a curve, or it could be higher, something like that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t prejudge the outcome of the review.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let the experts focus on it.\xc2\xa0 And after the review is issued and after the independent panel of experts has had an opportunity to consider it, then we can talk about it a little bit more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Other two subjects.\xc2\xa0 On Ferguson -- we understand that the Attorney General is \xe2\x80\x9cdisappointed about the leaks from the grand jury,\xe2\x80\x9d and he finds it irresponsible.\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts about that, as it kind of signals to some that the police officer, Darren Wilson, is going to get off?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I\'ve seen the reports and I\'ve seen the reports about the leaked documents.\xc2\xa0 But this is the subject of an ongoing investigation and it\'s not something that I\'m going to comment on from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though your Attorney General is saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s disappointed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I believe that the report that you\'re citing is citing an anonymous official with knowledge of the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I talked to someone from Justice, so I\'m telling you what they told me -- disappointed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So someone anonymously characterized to you the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s views.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not questioning the veracity of that person\xe2\x80\x99s comments to you, but I am pointing out that I\'m talking in a much more public setting and I\'m not going to do that because there is an ongoing investigation right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last question.\xc2\xa0 With the frustrations and concerns in this nation about Ebola, I\'m thinking back a couple months ago when the President made this big push for people to invest in Africa.\xc2\xa0 Has this Ebola scare kind of tapped down some of the excitement about businesses going to sub-Saharan Africa and investing in Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the first thing I would observe is that we were -- that this Africa summit that the President convened here in Washington, D.C. in August occurred right sort of at the beginning of public attention focusing on this Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 And I think in the context of that summit we saw a lot of excitement and interest about the opportunity that exists for Africa -- not just for the African people, but also for American businesses who are interested in new markets.</p>\n<p>So there continue to be very exciting opportunities in Africa.\xc2\xa0 And I have not detected any reduction in the interest and, in some cases, even passion for strengthening the ties between the United States and Africa, and capitalizing on those connections to benefit both the African people but also the American people back here at home.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, talking about the midterms, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Senator Begich calling him not relevant?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those comments.\xc2\xa0 He certainly -- again, Senator Begich is certainly entitled to his opinion, but I think the vast majority of Americans would agree that whoever the sitting President of the United States happens to be is relevant in a lot of important ways.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 This is the flipside, though, of the comment that a lot of the President\xe2\x80\x99s supporters -- including Bill Clinton -- have said, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not about what\xe2\x80\x99s two years from now; this is a six-year proposition.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment that exists in both a positive and a negative connotation.\xc2\xa0 These are senators running for a longer term, saying that, please elect me for this longer term.\xc2\xa0 Does the President at least agree that there\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment there -- does he agree with the sentiment, rather, that these are people who are running for a longer term and that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be here for the entirety of it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well that\xe2\x80\x99s a basic fact of arithmetic, so I would concede that.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, these individuals -- as the President himself has said -- these are individuals that have their own names on the ballot.\xc2\xa0 And that is what voters will evaluate.\xc2\xa0 And the President is interested in doing everything that he can to support those candidates who are passionate about prioritizing an agenda that benefits middle-class families, because the President believes that policies that support middle-class families are in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 Our economy grows from the middle out, so the more that we can invest and support middle-class families the better off our economy will be.</p>\n<p>And so the President is passionate about that, and the President will continue to passionately advocate for the election of candidates who share that point of view.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple for you on different topics.\xc2\xa0 You talked about striking the right balance between security and the traditional role of the White House as a tourist destination.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- will there be -- one person whose job it is to be, like, a public advocate?\xc2\xa0 The person who says to the security people, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine but we need to do X, we can\xe2\x80\x99t do this, we can\xe2\x80\x99t put up that 18-foot wall, the moat with the alligators -- no way.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is there one person whose jobs it is, sort of like a devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate or a public advocate -- is there one person whose job that is?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me clarify one thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that the White House is a tourist destination.\xc2\xa0 So certainly it is and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyed by I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s thousands of tourists on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that the White House stands as an important symbol of our democracy, that it is a place -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s the People\xe2\x80\x99s House, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a place that is so accessible that thousands of people can tour it on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s not just protecting a popular tourist destination; it\xe2\x80\x99s about protecting the symbolism of that popular tourist destination continuing to be accessible to the American public and to the individuals who are responsible for electing the person who lives there.\xc2\xa0 So I did want to clarify that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the Secret Service to be sure, but I think even they would tell you that they\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of this need to protect the President, protect the White House, but also to protect the symbolism of the White House as the People\xe2\x80\x99s House.\xc2\xa0 I think even they would convey to you that that is a priority that they share.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that it will be taken into account as the ongoing security review is conducted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so there\xe2\x80\x99s not one person whose job it is to make this argument?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is sort of an ombudsman, if you will, in this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A czar.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That seems to be a popular word choice.\xc2\xa0 It would be a little ironic to have a White House czar, though, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I can definitely rule out the creation of a White House czar.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moat master.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s better, actually.\xc2\xa0 And David raised the issue of countries that are -- where people are open to paying ransom for people abducted by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Has the President ever raised that issue with another world leader directly in his many phone calls?\xc2\xa0 Has he ever said, by the way, I also need you to maybe do something about the fact that your businesses or your government is paying ransoms?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is putting me on the hook to account for a large number of phone calls, some of which aren\xe2\x80\x99t even public, most of which haven\xe2\x80\x99t been read out in a lot of detail.\xc2\xa0 But I will say as a general matter -- and I do think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably said this before -- that the President has on a number of occasions made the case to other world leaders about the benefits of the position that\xe2\x80\x99s taken by the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that is specifically that no one should pay ransom to extremist organizations or terrorists who are holding hostages.\xc2\xa0 And as painful as that policy decision is, it is clearly in the best interest of the global community for that policy to be in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of when the last time he would have done that is, either to a group or to an individual?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think about the last time that might have occurred and I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your guys\xe2\x80\x99 old friend, David Axelrod, was quoted in Bloomberg Business Week today.\xc2\xa0 The story is kind of about the President\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to maybe embrace the optics or the politics of situations, and Axelrod said there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s a theatrical nature to the presidency that he, the President, resists; sometimes he can be a little negligent in the symbolism.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what your reaction to that is, and if you would concede that the President\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance on that front has sort of hurt him politically and Democrats headed into the midterm elections.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the President did an interview with Chuck Todd on the first airing of \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d when he was the host and the President said almost exactly this thing word for word.\xc2\xa0 So this is an assessment that the President has acknowledged before in terms of his occasional inattention to some of the optical aspects of his role.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the same time, I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a stretch to suggest that there is any direct political consequence for this, either in the upcoming elections or, frankly, in any elections at this point.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I know that this is for the benefit of your reader, something that you consider very carefully and you\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly considered it more carefully than I have.\xc2\xa0 But the general view about the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention to those aspects of his job is something that the President himself has discussed before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any effort to address that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s something the President mentioned then, but also in his \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d interview about golfing after sort of -- after I think the death of James Foley being announced.\xc2\xa0 Are there any steps that you guys are undertaking to maybe play more politics, since it seems to be something that is kind of a constant criticism and something that the President has acknowledged himself?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would characterize it as politics and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would characterize the decision about the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities after discussing the tragic death of Mr. Foley as politics.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something slightly different than that.</p>\n<p>But I do think that the President, again, in the context of that \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d interview did discuss his own desire to try to be more attentive to those aspects of the job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a frustration among I guess you guys -- I think maybe we hear it privately -- but a frustration that there\xe2\x80\x99s these sort of shiny ball objects that come up again and again that perpetuate this sort of criticism?\xc2\xa0 Another point in this piece is that lots of these crises seem to eventually be resolved -- HealthCare.gov is an example.\xc2\xa0 A huge media criticism, but then a success that maybe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get covered as much.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you guys feel is unfair and has maybe contributed to the President\xe2\x80\x99s declining approval ratings?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the short answer is no.\xc2\xa0 But it has not escaped the attention of those of us at the White House, that what the President is focused on can, on occasion, be different than what others might be focused on.\xc2\xa0 The President is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on results and the one that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on solving problems.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an important role for the news media and for advocates and for even other politicians to play in shining a light on problems that need to be solved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there is -- this is probably even a core aspect of human nature, that there is less attention focused on the solutions, and some people observe that that makes the news a little depressing sometimes.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, there\xe2\x80\x99s also I think a pretty legitimate reason for that, which is we should be focused on the problems because we have a government and leadership in this country that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on solving them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think the attention to those is understandable, but it is where there can sometimes be a slight misalignment between our approach to these challenges and the approach that\xe2\x80\x99s, again, taken by the news media or by pundits or even other politicians who would rather spend more time talking about the problems when we\xe2\x80\x99re actually focused on taking those problems and turning them into solutions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s track record when it comes to things like the issue of unaccompanied minors at the border is a pretty good example of that -- that there was, understandably, a lot of attention around this problem -- but because of the efforts of this administration to work diplomatically with countries in Central America but also to focus our resources at the border, that this is a problem that has not been entirely solved, of course, because Congress has -- congressional Republicans have been resistant to passing comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the situation at the border is now better than it has been in a couple of years when measured by the number of unaccompanied minors who are attempting to cross into the country.\xc2\xa0 And then that\xe2\x80\x99s just sort of one example of where there\xe2\x80\x99s persistent focus on the problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President and his administration at the direction of the President comes in and, through a lot of hard work, puts in place a solution.\xc2\xa0 But by the time that solution is put in place, everybody has sort of moved on to something else.\xc2\xa0 So that is, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an aspect of human nature that\xe2\x80\x99s involved here, but it does account for the different perspectives that are sometimes on full display in this room, at least.</p>\n<p>Juliet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions related to last night\xe2\x80\x99s incident.\xc2\xa0 I know you said that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed it with the President.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he has been briefed, and by whom?\xc2\xa0 And regarding the dogs, who you omitted mentioning earlier but then gave due credit to, are these animals something that you and other White House staffers interact with?\xc2\xa0 Do you know -- are they integrated into the fabric of White House life or are they largely -- they\xe2\x80\x99re doing something else and you don\xe2\x80\x99t actually see them often because they\xe2\x80\x99re really only deployed in these situations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s briefing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which he has been briefed on this, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at getting an answer to that question and maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll just append it to the briefing transcript when we get it out tonight to make sure that everybody gets it.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you an answer on that. **</p>\n<p>As it relates to the K-9 Unit of the Secret Service, the animals that performed so bravely last night are not something that we come into regular contact with here.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is probably a good reason why these animals are kept at some remove -- (laughter) -- from employees and others who frequent the grounds of the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a reflection on them or you, Josh?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe both.\xc2\xa0 Maybe both.\xc2\xa0 But I think the individual last night probably saw pretty vividly why we all keep our distance.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just briefly, I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t comment in great detail -- you obviously compared the handling of the incidents.\xc2\xa0 Can you say broadly whether there has been a change in procedure in terms of handling potential jumpers as a result of what happened in September?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For a detailed accounting of that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service and they may be able to be in a position to give you a better update on that.\xc2\xa0 I do recall from earlier discussions about the security posture at the White House that in the aftermath of the incident from a month or so ago, there were some changes that were immediately put in place to strengthen the security around the White House complex.\xc2\xa0 Jim noted earlier the bike rack that is in place -- or maybe it was Bill that noted that -- in front of the North Lawn of the White House.\xc2\xa0 So there are some measures that have been taken, some of which are plainly visible to those of you who frequent the White House, some of which may not be readily apparent.\xc2\xa0 But for a detailed account of any of those, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service, who may be able to share more information with you about that.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just to follow up on Juliet and then a separate question.\xc2\xa0 As you know, members of Congress, when this first happened a month ago, whatever it was, their concern was not a single jumper but what would happen if there were multiple jumpers who were in coordination.\xc2\xa0 So in a serious way, can you respond whether there are now procedures in place where if that were to occur, that what we saw last night would happen multiple times along the fence?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty detailed question about our security posture and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service in terms of what resources and strategies they put in place to try to counter it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in a position to talk about that publicly I think for obvious reasons but you should try.</p>\n<p>The overall security posture of the White House is certainly part of the review and I think that would certainly be a threat that they would have to consider.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, on Ron Klain, can you tell us whether the President is encouraging him to talk to members of Congress as the new coordinator, separate and apart from whether he can testify tomorrow, to reach out to lawmakers, to talk to them about the procedures in place, to discuss their ideas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s had any conversations with members of Congress so far.\xc2\xa0 This is, of course -- he\xe2\x80\x99s a day and a half into the new gig here, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there obviously is a pretty robust staff in place to maintain our relationships with members of Congress. So we have a Leg Affairs department,\xc2\xa0 At the NSC, there are a contingent of folks that are responsible for talking to members of Congress about national security issues.\xc2\xa0 So there are people who are principally responsible for that.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I wouldn\'t rule out the occasional conversation between Ron and a member of Congress.</p>\n<p>He, obviously, is somebody who brings with him to the job some well-established relationships with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t rule out that he may put those relationships to use over the course of this assignment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you fill in any of the blanks about where he\xe2\x80\x99s working, does he have a staff and what he\xe2\x80\x99s compensated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where his office is right now.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been in several meetings with him, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not been in my office and I haven\'t been in his.\xc2\xa0 At this point, he\'s being paid as a consultant to the White House, because, as I mentioned earlier, this is a relatively short-term assignment that he\xe2\x80\x99s currently focused on, on the order of five or six months.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s being paid as a consultant at a salary that\'s in line with the salary that\xe2\x80\x99s paid to other assistants to the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the size of his staff, I don\'t know that he has anybody onboard yet, but I assume that at some point he\'ll have at least an assistant to help him take on this important role.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing is that he obviously is stepping into a role that is already at the hub of a pretty extensive infrastructure; that as he works with other members of the National Security Council and other folks at CDC and HHS, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty robust infrastructure already in place.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s easy to plug him in there.\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll need a large contingent of staffers to help him do his job.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will you continue to speak for him, brief us, or will he do that himself?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I have mentioned earlier, I do not, and Mr. Klain does not envision the role that he has now as being one that is what you would describe as a public face.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t rule out the occasional, again, the occasional conversation with a reporter, possibly a briefing here, but that is pretty low on his to-do list.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of other things that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on right now to ensure that the whole-of-government approach that the President has pursued to dealing with this Ebola situation is up to the standards that the President has set.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s is going to visit the CDC next week, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have heard that, yes, that he\xe2\x80\x99s planning to travel down to Atlanta next week and to meet with some of the officials at the CDC that have been working on the situation for quite some time now.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two clarifications.\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re going to be quick.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First on the White House fence-jumper issue.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s this investigation --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 First on the what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fence-jumper issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I know there\xe2\x80\x99s this independent panel that\'s sort of looking at best practices, and then that goes as recommendations to the Department of Homeland Security?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The way that this works is the review is currently being conducted by the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Ale Mayorkas.\xc2\xa0 Typically, the Deputy Secretary at a Cabinet agency is responsible for the functioning of the various components of that agency.\xc2\xa0 Secret Service is obviously a component of the Department of Homeland Security, so he has the responsibility for ensuring that that component is functioning properly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s going to conduct the review.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to work closely with the general counsel at DHS to conduct that review.\xc2\xa0 Once that review is completed, which should be the first week in November, I believe, he will then turn over that review to a panel of independent experts that the Secretary of Homeland Security has named.\xc2\xa0 They will review his report and put forward a series of recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the leadership of the Secret Service about specific measures that should be taken to strengthen security at the White House.</p>\n<p>They will offer up some recommendations about what the permanent leadership of the Secret Service should look like, and they will also make recommendations, if necessary, about additional areas for review at the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s my question -- in sort of this effort to strike the balance, if these recommendations come in, and the President doesn\'t feel that it strikes the right balance -- it goes too far one way, they want to keep people on the other side of Lafayette Park, whatever it is, would the President say, you got to go back to the drawing board, or is this a decision that would be made totally independent, free of any influence or decision-making from the Oval Office?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I feel confident that as decisions are made about how to implement these additional security measures, that the White House will be consulted and in the loop on that.\xc2\xa0 But this will be something that is driven, however, by those with the most security expertise at the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, on these efforts to get at ISIS financing, these sanctions that are potentially being plotted, one of the criticism of the sanctions on Russian, for instance, has been a lot of these individuals don\'t have a great deal of assets in the United States.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s only so much that the U.S. Treasury is able to do on its own.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair criticism in these types of potential sanctions, as well?\xc2\xa0 How many of these ISIS financiers have assets in the United States?\xc2\xa0 What can the Treasury really do on its down to try and limit the flow of revenue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is an excellent question.\xc2\xa0 I regret that David is not here to answer it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I tried earlier.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not blaming you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not blaming you, to be clear.\xc2\xa0 But let me give you my understanding of it.\xc2\xa0 You may be able to get somebody at the Treasury Department to give you a more cogent explanation.</p>\n<p>What we have done to deal with the situation in Ukraine, in terms of applying sanctions to Russia, is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very hard to coordinate the application of that sanctions regime with our partners in Western Europe.\xc2\xa0 And those partners in Western Europe are economies where some of the targets of these sanctions do have some exposure.\xc2\xa0 And by working closely with our partners in Western Europe, we have been able to impose a substantial economic cost on the Russian economy and on senior members of that government because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to work in coordination to maximize the impact of the sanctions.</p>\n<p>A similar strategy is being employed in this situation, as well.\xc2\xa0 David did make reference to the fact that we are working closely with the other 60 members of this broad international coalition to pursue this strategy.\xc2\xa0 And shutting down the financing of ISIL is part of this strategy.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s working very closely with other members of our coalition to apply sanctions in a way that will maximize the financial impact of the regime.</p>\n<p>And that is why -- he made reference to the fact that he travels fairly frequently to the region of the world where you would anticipate that individuals who are closely aligned with ISIL would have significant exposure.\xc2\xa0 And so we are working very closely with our partners in this international coalition to coordinate and maximize the impact of this sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re confident that they\xe2\x80\x99ll go along with it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s something that is obviously the subject of regular discussion.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have been quite pleased -- and again, David would have a more tangible assessment -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very pleased with the cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from members of the coalition because they understand that this is an important part of the strategy.</p>\n<p>Tamara, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s really quick.\xc2\xa0 When that Homeland Security review of the fence-jumping incident comes out, or is completed, will it come out?\xc2\xa0 Will we get it?\xc2\xa0 Will there be some amount of it that is released to the public or not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would anticipate that there will be some aspects of the review that will not be made public.\xc2\xa0 They would relate to basic facts about the security of the White House that we would understandably need to keep private.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, I would anticipate that some aspects of the review will be made public.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to work through once the review has been completed.</p>\n<p>So, Chris, I recognize that I skipped over you.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you had something that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, let me just ask you really quickly --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There was no slight intended.\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- because of something the President said last night, which is that the facts weren\xe2\x80\x99t known totally about Ottawa, but that it was something that we have to factor in.\xc2\xa0 He said, in the ongoing efforts we have to counter terrorist attacks in our country.\xc2\xa0 Is there, beyond that, always ongoing review, any new meetings, any new strategies that they\'re looking at as a result of what was seen yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early at this point to say -- after all these attacks have only occurred in the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that our counterterrorism professionals are very mindful of this risk that has existed for some time.\xc2\xa0 And I think this -- these latest incidents only underscore the high stakes of the success of the strategies that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place.</p>\n<p>And so if there is a need to refine or update or strengthen that strategy, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that these -- that our counterterrorism professionals have all the authority that they need to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kind of a subset of that, is there a review ongoing now of security at government buildings?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not one that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of beyond sort of the regular assessment and reassessment that is done on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good afternoon.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:19 P.M.
