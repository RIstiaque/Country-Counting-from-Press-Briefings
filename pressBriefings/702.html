EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being with us.\xc2\xa0 I have with me today, back by popular demand, Todd Park, Assistant to the President, Chief Technology Officer.\xc2\xa0 But before I turn it over to him, who is going to speak a little bit about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing today, I wanted to remind you that the President today is traveling to Austin, Texas to kick off a series of middle-class jobs and opportunity tours.</p>\n<p>In his State of the Union address, the President laid out his belief that the middle class is the engine of economic growth.\xc2\xa0 To reignite that engine there are three areas we need to invest in:\xc2\xa0 jobs, skills and opportunity.\xc2\xa0 We need to build on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last four years, and that means investing in things that are already creating good-paying, stable jobs that can support a middle-class family.</p>\n<p>Starting this week, President Obama will visit communities across the country to learn what has helped them become successful and to use these models of growth to encourage Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 The President will make several stops today in the Austin area.\xc2\xa0 During this trip, the President will announce two important executive actions that will strengthen the economy. These steps are not a substitute for the bold congressional action we need to create jobs and grow the economy, but they will make a difference.</p>\n<p>First, the President is following through on a promise he made during the State of the Union address by launching competitions to create three new manufacturing innovation institutes with a federal commitment of $200 million across five federal agencies:\xc2\xa0 Defense, Energy, Commerce, NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>To build off the initial success of a pilot institute headquartered in Youngstown, Ohio, the President announced in the State of the Union that his administration would move forward and launch three new manufacturing innovations institutes this year. The President will continue to call on Congress to act on his proposal for a one-time, $1 billion investment to create a network of an additional 15 manufacturing innovation institutes across the country.</p>\n<p>This initiative has bipartisan support in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the Senate passed an amendment as part of the budget resolution.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to get this done.</p>\n<p>The President will tour Applied Materials, the kind of company that would thrive -- that could thrive on the investment that comes along with these manufacturing institutes.\xc2\xa0 He recognizes these hubs can encourage firms like Applied Materials to invest, innovate, and create more high-quality jobs in the United States.</p>\n<p>The President will also issue an executive order requiring that newly released government data be made freely available in open machine-readable formats while appropriately safeguarding privacy, confidentiality and security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s in relation to that executive order that I brought Todd here to speak with you briefly and to answer any questions you might have about it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty exciting stuff.</p>\n<p>Todd.</p>\n<p>MR. PARK:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Hello, everybody.\xc2\xa0 So as Jay said, the President is also issuing today a historic executive order that will make information generated and stored by the federal government more open and accessible to innovators and the public to fuel entrepreneurship and economic growth while increasing government transparency and efficiency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So specifically, the executive order and an accompanying open data policy requires that, going forward, new and modernized federal information resources will be made available in open, machine-readable formats while appropriately safeguarding privacy, confidentiality and security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This move will make troves of previously inaccessible or unmanageable data easily available to entrepreneurs, researchers and others who can use that data to generate new products and services, build businesses and create jobs.</p>\n<p>Open government data already powers a lot of innovations we take for granted.\xc2\xa0 So, for example, weather data from the National Weather Service powers everything from weather newscasts to weather apps on your phone, to new kinds of insurance products.\xc2\xa0 The federal government has made the Global Positioning System available for public use for decades, and I think as all of us know, GPS powers everything from apps on your phone to navigation systems to precision crop farming.</p>\n<p>In fact, just these two types of open government data, weather and GPS, alone have added tens of billions of dollars in annual value to the American economy, as basically the government has given taxpayers back the data that they pay for and our entrepreneurs across the country have tapped into that data and produced all these innovations that have improved our lives, grown the economy, and created great middle-class jobs.</p>\n<p>So the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive order and open data policy today will turbocharge that and accelerate that and make all kinds of new information resources available in fields like health and medicine, science, education, energy, public safety, and much more.\xc2\xa0 And we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see what amazing technological innovators will do with this data to improve all of our lives, grow the economy, and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of those tech companies will be right in Austin where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anybody have any questions for Todd?\xc2\xa0 Mark my words this is going to be very important stuff down the road.\xc2\xa0 This is a huge deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you, Todd.</p>\n<p>MR. PARK:\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much, everybody.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s our topper.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here for your questions on other subjects.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President of Afghanistan said today that the United States wants to keep nine bases there after the U.S. withdrawal in 2014.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm what he said?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As the President has already made clear, Darlene, the United States does not seek permanent military bases in Afghanistan, and any U.S. presence after 2014 would only be at the invitation of the Afghanistan government and aimed at training Afghanistan forces and targeting the remnants of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we have said, we envision that the bilateral security agreement will address access to and use of Afghanistan facilities by U.S. forces.\xc2\xa0 But we seek no permanent military bases in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will they be temporary perhaps?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we seek no permanent bases.\xc2\xa0 Any continued presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan beyond 2014 would be subject to an agreement between the Afghanistan government and the U.S. government, and would only be at the request of the Afghanistan government, and would only be for the purposes that I just mentioned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How close is the President to deciding the U.S. troop levels after 2014?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing process.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 We are in the process of drawing down our forces in keeping with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment and policy, together with our partners, and turning over gradually full security lead to Afghan forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a question about Syria?\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. worried that Russia may be preparing to sell air defense systems to Syria?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that Israel warned the U.S. about?\xc2\xa0 And did the President and Bibi discuss it when they talked in the call that was read out yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you saw the readout that we gave of the conversation the President had with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other details on that call.\xc2\xa0 We are aware of the reports that you mentioned, but I have no further information for you on it.\xc2\xa0 I would say that we have consistently called on Russia to cut off the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s supply of Russian weapons, including air defense systems that are destabilizing to the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have also long said that Russia could play a more constructive role in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this this week, the United States and Russia recommitted to the Geneva Framework and pledged to build on the Geneva process by working to bring both sides of the Syrian conflict to the negotiating table with members of the international community.\xc2\xa0 We are working to build on this momentum.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the provision of additional weapons to the regime will not hasten a political solution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whether the President and Mr. Putin have discussed this directly?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve put out on those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that they have.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, again, as I just said, the Russians are aware of our view because we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed it that Russia could play a more constructive role in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we have consistently called on Russia not to provide a further supply of weapons to the Assad regime, including air defense systems that are particularly destabilizing to the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that Russia has agreed to take part in this process with the U.S., does that make the White House think possibly that they might be prepared to change their position towards Assad?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Steve, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, we\'ve been very clear about our disappointment with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s support for the Assad regime, its veto of resolutions at the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 But we have consistently engaged with Russia on this issue and made the case that further support for Assad would not be good for the future of Syria, for the Syrian people, or for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Syria in the future.\xc2\xa0 And we have been very consistent about that both in our conversations with Russian officials and in public.\xc2\xa0 And those conversations continue.</p>\n<p>We do view it as a step forward, the fact that Russia, with the United States, recommitted to the Geneva Framework to a political transition, and we will continue work on that basis towards what we believe ultimately has to happen, which is a political transition to a post-Assad Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday in the Senate, they rejected Senator Coburn\xe2\x80\x99s bill for access to have guns on federal lands.\xc2\xa0 It was rejected by four votes -- 56 to 43.\xc2\xa0 Does that concern you at all that it was by a smaller margin than background checks not too long ago?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any specific comment on that vote.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s views on the disappointing votes taken by the Senate on expanding background checks and other measures -- common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are well known.\xc2\xa0 Specifically on the issue of expanding background checks, you had a minority of the U.S. Senate explicitly and flagrantly reject the will of 90 percent of the American people, and that\'s very disappointing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, speaking also about the Senate, Republicans have submitted some 1,000 questions to Gina McCarthy and the EPA and there appear to be some delays in that process.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about the nomination -- about her nomination specifically?\xc2\xa0 And what is the reason for the EPA not answering those questions?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your information wrong.\xc2\xa0 The EPA has answered those questions.\xc2\xa0 There has been an historic level of obstructionism --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely -- from the Senate on this nomination and others.\xc2\xa0 This submission of record levels of QFRs has been consistent with Republican practice -- is consistent with Republican practice that we saw in earlier nominations this year.\xc2\xa0 And it just demonstrates this predilection for obstructionism that is bad for the functioning of the federal government in important areas.\xc2\xa0 And we call on Republicans in the Senate to stop gumming up the works when it comes to the confirmation process of nominees who are enormously qualified for the jobs that the President has asked them to fill and to get about the business of confirming them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned at all about her nomination?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Senate will confirm her to her post, and we call on Republicans to stop the theater and to move forward with the process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned, because of this following so soon after what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening with the Perez nomination, that there\xe2\x80\x99s like a pattern and practice?\xc2\xa0 And what can you -- other than make a public appeal for it, what are you prepared to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think \xe2\x80\x9cpattern and practice\xe2\x80\x9d is a good phrase to describe the obstructionism that we\'ve consistently seen from Republicans on nominations.\xc2\xa0 It\'s regrettable, because these are nominees who are highly qualified for the positions the President has asked them to fill.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to work with the Senate to move these nominations forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the potential sale of the surface-to-air missiles affect the President\'s decision-making in terms of arming the Syrian rebels?\xc2\xa0 Does it affect the timeline?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have any specific comment on the reports about those arms sales.\xc2\xa0 I did make my points about our view of Russia providing further weaponry to the Assad regime. When it comes to the options the President is consistently reviewing in our effort to support the opposition in Syria, that process is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 A lot of factors are taken into account.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I said the other day remains true today -- and that is that it\'s very important to make sure that we make policy decisions that help achieve the goal that we seek, which is a transition to a post-Assad Syria and that we do not make decisions that inadvertently cause more chaos or more violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we are very deliberate about our assessments of the options that are on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McConnell and Boehner today --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add I think an important point to note because it\xe2\x80\x99s public is that we announced an increase of another $100 million in humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, building on the significant aid we\'ve provided already that has made us the single-largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McConnell and Boehner today sent a letter to the President saying they\'ll be declining to recommend appointments to IPAB.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that public confidence in IPAB will suffer because there won\'t be any Republican input?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact that Republicans have continued to push for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act I believe demonstrates how out of touch they are with the American people, who are tired of efforts by Republicans to re-fight the political battles of the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'ve lost count, but I think the House has scheduled -- the House Republicans has scheduled a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act for something like the 40th time next week.\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t work 39 times prior; it won\'t work the 40th time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are about the business of implementing a law that will expand health care coverage to millions of Americans, will reduce overall health costs in our country, and will reduce the deficit in the long run, as the CBO has said in its analysis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It just demonstrates again how out of touch with what the American people want the House Republicans have become.\xc2\xa0 Instead of focusing on measures that could help us invest in innovation and manufacturing and job creation, instead of focusing on common-sense efforts to reduce our deficit in a balanced way, House Republicans are voting again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Shockingly, John Boehner said two days after the election that Obamacare was law and that they would have to reevaluate their efforts to repeal it.\xc2\xa0 I guess he was convinced to change his mind by elements of his caucus yet again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what more can you tell us about the meeting on sexual assault in the military that Valerie Jarrett and Tina Tchen are having at the White House today?\xc2\xa0 What lawmakers are coming?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the purpose?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a list of lawmakers who are coming.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s bicameral and bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 But the White House will be able to provide I believe a list of attendees.</p>\n<p>The meeting reflects the level of concern that you heard from the President the other day at his press conference with the President of South Korea.\xc2\xa0 He has zero tolerance for this, for sexual assault in the military.\xc2\xa0 And he was clear that, as Commander-in-Chief, he believes that anyone who engages in sexual assault is dishonoring the uniform that they wear, and that anyone who is a victim of sexual assault should know that he, the Commander-in-Chief, and the leadership that he has in place has their backs and is actively taking steps to address this significant problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the White House preparing for a conflict with congressional Republicans over the debt ceiling this summer?\xc2\xa0 And do you expect that tax reform would be a part of a deal over that at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are not negotiating over Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to pay the bills that they incur, period.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It would be -- it is remarkable to imagine that Republicans would want to hold the world economy hostage to their insistence on tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m in the communications business. I don\'t envy the person who has to try to sell that to the American people, that their position would be that they would wreck the economy, not just the United States but of the world, if they don\'t get more tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a tough sell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the President meeting with entrepreneurs and also the local residents?\xc2\xa0 Is it before the tour, after the tour? The schedule wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very clear.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get you more details on the schedule.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else about today other than the school visit and the visit with the workers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have further information for you as the day progresses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort to turn Texas blue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got that question yesterday, and I can tell you that this is a visit focused entirely on issues of economic development and job creation.\xc2\xa0 Austin is a center for innovation and development of high-tech jobs, jobs that come from the industries of the future, and that makes it an excellent place to visit to highlight the kind of activity that\'s taking place in a variety of cities and states across the country where the creative energy of our entrepreneurs as well as our workers is contributing positively to economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>And it reflects two things about Washington -- one, that it\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionable when Washington takes action, as it has because of congressional Republicans, to inflict wounds on the economy unnecessarily, to slow down the recovery that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and it underscores the need for Congress to assist that economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top, the President is calling on Congress to support this initiative for an investment in these innovation hubs, innovation institutes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an initiative that has bipartisan support and that we hope will gain the support of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What congressmen are here --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe Lloyd Doggett is here, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check and see if there are others.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Pickering has told some news outlets that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to testify in front of the House Oversight Committee.\xc2\xa0 Is there any expectation from the White House that he will?\xc2\xa0 And furthermore, Dick Cheney was on the Hill this morning and he was talking to folks on the Hill, and he said that Secretary Clinton should be subpoenaed if necessary.\xc2\xa0 Any response first on Pickering, and then secondly to Vice President Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s comments?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to address your questions to Ambassador Pickering.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s independent from the administration, served administrations of both parties honorably, one of the most highly regarded diplomats of his generation.\xc2\xa0 So I would ask him. I have no comment on Vice President Cheney\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forgive me if this has been asked in recent days -- has the President spoken with any of the women or families involved in the situation in Cleveland?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to meet with Governor Perry while he\xe2\x80\x99s here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.\xc2\xa0 He saw Governor Perry when he was in Waco the other day -- a few weeks ago at the memorial for the victims of the explosion in West, Texas.\xc2\xa0 But I can check, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he\'s seeing Governor Perry today.**</p>\n<p>** Governor Perry greeted and met with the President upon his arrival in Austin today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:25 A.M.
