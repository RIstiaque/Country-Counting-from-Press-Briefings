Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:43 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I want to welcome you here to the briefing room for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And first, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say that today we are highlighting how the Affordable Care Act helps young adults.\xc2\xa0 As you know, at approximately 2:00 p.m. Eastern, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will meet with a group of moms in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 They will be joined by White House senior advisor and chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls, Valerie Jarrett.</p>\n<p>Moms have a unique role to play in helping young adults gain health care coverage.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the health care law, over 3 million young adults gained insurance because they can now stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 health plans until age 26.\xc2\xa0 Before the health care law, many insurance companies would kick young adults off of their parents\xe2\x80\x99 health plans on their 19th birthday, or when they stopped being a full-time student.</p>\n<p>For a lot of young adults, that\xe2\x80\x99s the exact time when they need the stability of being able to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans because they are transitioning in and out of school or jobs.\xc2\xa0 Now families have the security of knowing that their children can stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans until their 26th birthday.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act also provides new coverage for young adults -- new coverage options for young adults who may not have access to health coverage through their parents, their school, or through their employer.\xc2\xa0 Nearly half of eligible single young adults who are uninsured may be able to get coverage for $50 or less per month in the health insurance marketplaces in 2014.\xc2\xa0 And nearly 7 in 10 single young adults who are uninsured may be able to pay $100 or less.\xc2\xa0 In addition, many young adults will be newly eligible for Medicaid, which, in a growing number of states led by both Democrats and Republicans, is expanding under the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>If opponents of reform had their way, if they repealed the health care law, millions of young adults who have gained health insurance through their parents\xe2\x80\x99 health plans would have that right taken away, while others would lose access to Medicaid or to tax credits, raising costs for millions of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>And now to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any kind of readout on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with his intel review board today?\xc2\xa0 And was this a meeting for the review group to present their recommendations to the President?\xc2\xa0 Did he call them in because he had questions about those recommendations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The review board -- the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies finished their report, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And this morning, the President met with the members of the review group to discuss that report, which they submitted last Friday.\xc2\xa0 We will have a readout of that meeting for you later today.</p>\n<p>For now, I\xe2\x80\x99d just note that the President is grateful to the group -- Richard Clarke, Michael Morell, Geoffrey Stone, Cass Sunstein, and Peter Swire -- for devoting themselves to this effort over the past several months in providing input -- thoughtful input for the administration to consider as we conclude the ongoing interagency review of signals intelligence collection being led by the White House.</p>\n<p>Now, over the next several weeks, we will be reviewing the review group\xe2\x80\x99s report and its 46 recommendations as we consider the path forward, including sorting through which recommendations we will implement, which might require further study, and which we will choose not to pursue.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a substantive, lengthy report, and it merits serious review and assessment.\xc2\xa0 When we finish the internal review, the overall internal review in January, the President will deliver remarks to outline the outcomes of our work.</p>\n<p>Anticipating this question, I\'ll go right to the answer:\xc2\xa0 While we had intended to release the review group\'s full report in January, as I said earlier, given inaccurate and incomplete reports in the press about the report\'s content, we felt it was important to allow people to see the full report to draw their own conclusions.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason, we will be doing that this afternoon, releasing the full report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re releasing the full report.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President going to speak on that at all today, or will he just --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make of that nature, and I can tell you that he -- not to expect that he would speak, because as I was saying earlier, this is a serious document for which the President is greatly appreciative.\xc2\xa0 A lot of work went into it.\xc2\xa0 It is long.\xc2\xa0 It contains a number of recommendations -- more than 40; 46 I believe is the total.\xc2\xa0 And he wants to and his team wants to take time to assess it, to review it.\xc2\xa0 And that is why in January, when the overall internal review is completed, the President will make remarks about the work that he has undertaken and the outcomes of his review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask you one question about Congress.\xc2\xa0 Two of the things that have actually managed to get done over the past couple of weeks in Congress, one was the nuclear option to allow some of your nominees to get through more quickly; that really seemed to kind of speak to the dysfunction in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And then the second is this budget deal which looks like it will pass today and give some hope that some of this dysfunction may be able to be put behind everyone.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering how the White House views both of those moves together and how you see it positioning both the White House and Capitol Hill for 2014.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Both reflect -- or have produced important progress; have helped loosen the logjam in Washington.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re correct that the decision made by the Majority Leader in the Senate was in reaction to the unprecedented level of obstruction that Senate Republicans were setting up to block nominees of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And the problem with that is that it prevented the normal functioning of government here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 There are positions that need to be filled, and the President nominates highly qualified individuals to fill them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as we discussed many times, often nominees were held up, were filibustered not because there was any substantive opposition to his or her r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 or qualifications for the job, but for partisan political reasons purely.\xc2\xa0 And that had reached a point where it was having a dramatic effect or a significant effect on the ability of the agencies and the government to function.\xc2\xa0 It is the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibility to nominate people to the bench.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the fact that you had gotten this through and now you have this budget deal that could follow it, where do you think that positions the White House and the Hill for 2014?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So this is the -- do we see glimmers of hope?\xc2\xa0 I think I mentioned yesterday that we do in the sense that there is certainly the potential that the bipartisan cooperation we saw in the reaching of an agreement on the budget and the bipartisan votes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the House and in cloture in the Senate could be positive augurs for the future.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not getting overexcited because we\xe2\x80\x99re not na\xc3\xafve about the obstructionism that continues to exist and the partisanship that tends more often than not to paralyze Washington and Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it is our hope that Republicans in the House in particular will see the wisdom in getting things done that the American people would like to see done, getting things done that, like the budget agreement, help the economy grow, help the middle class.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no dispute among outside analysts that this budget agreement, which is not viewed as a perfect document by either side, will result in more growth and more job creation and additional, albeit modest, deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that seem like a good thing?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that seem like something you can take to your constituents and argue on behalf of?\xc2\xa0 And there are so many other areas of potential cooperation that we do hope the budget agreement portends a better future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as the President has long said, he will keep focused on his priorities, the priorities that he believes the American people want those of us in Washington focused on -- on the economy, and expanding the middle class and making it more secure; in addressing the issue of rising inequality and the need to create ladders of opportunity for those who would aspire to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And he will work with Congress, and hopefully Congress will want to work with him.\xc2\xa0 And where Congress will not, he will look for ways to advance that agenda administratively using his executive authority.</p>\n<p>If we\xe2\x80\x99re really lucky -- we, the country -- then he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to do both.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to advance a positive, moderate agenda that helps grow the economy, helps the middle class, continues the work to restore our manufacturing base.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I was struck yesterday after the briefing, and I was looking at some of the back pages of The New York Times, and I found on page B3 a story of the enormous investment being made by American automobile companies, investments that will here in the United States create more jobs because demand is strong, they\xe2\x80\x99re building good cars, and people are going to work building those cars.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s huge news, no matter where it appears in the newspaper.\xc2\xa0 And we want to continue that progress.\xc2\xa0 We want to keep building that better future and that stronger economy.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you provide a little more detail about what happens between the release of the report today and the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech?\xc2\xa0 Does he have all the information he needs?\xc2\xa0 Will he consult with others to make his decisions?\xc2\xa0 Will he take this with him on vacation as he goes for his holiday and think about narrowing down the recommendations?\xc2\xa0 And will he give the speech, or his presentation on this, before or after the State of the Union?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start at the back.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date for when he will address the review that has been ongoing, of which this is a part and not the entirety.\xc2\xa0 Because the State of the Union address is on January 28th, I think the odds favor it happening before that, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Vegas with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think you\xe2\x80\x99re not wrong in assuming that he\xe2\x80\x99ll take the report with him and study it and work on it.\xc2\xa0 The President will no doubt consult with members of his team, as he has been all along on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recall what this is about and has been about.\xc2\xa0 The review is looking across the board at our intelligence gathering to ensure that we, as we gather intelligence, we are properly accounting for both the security of our citizens and our allies and the privacy concerns shared by Americans and citizens around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We need to ensure that our intelligence resources are most effectively supporting our foreign policy and national security objectives, that we are more effectively weighing the risks and rewards of our activities.\xc2\xa0 And that includes ensuring that we are above all focused on the threats to the American people.</p>\n<p>The President has been clear that even as we review our efforts and make some changes in how we do things, we will not harm our ability to face those threats.\xc2\xa0 That is his number-one obligation as Commander-in-Chief:\xc2\xa0 to take the steps necessary to protect the United States and protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 But as I said yesterday and the President said, we need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not gathering intelligence solely because we can but because we must, because we need it in order to achieve the objective of protecting the United States, protecting the American people, protecting our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned in the past some of the areas that this overall internal review will look at.\xc2\xa0 And I know that, and you can be sure that, the President will be very deliberate in assessing the recommendations produced by the review board, as well as the work done by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\xc2\xa0 So this is a fairly broad assessment that\xe2\x80\x99s being done, and the President will take his time because it is absolutely necessary to do that in his review.\xc2\xa0 And come January, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have concluded that work and make a presentation on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will it come out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Sometime this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an hour for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different topic, Senator McConnell said yesterday that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t envision an increase in the debt ceiling without -- or a clean bill without some kind of additional issue attached.\xc2\xa0 Others in the House have said the same thing.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Senator McConnell has in the past made clear that he felt the strategy pursued by Republicans in October was not a winning strategy; that the brinksmanship, the threat of default, as well as the insistence on shutting down the government did not work well in advancing Republican Party priorities.\xc2\xa0 I think that was in the end a fairly consensus view here in Washington and around the country.\xc2\xa0 And around the country, the view was not just that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great for the Republican Party, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great for the country.\xc2\xa0 It was terrible for the country and wholly unnecessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, as I said yesterday, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is unchanged.\xc2\xa0 He will not negotiate over Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to pay the bills that Congress has racked up.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen comments from a Republican leader in the House.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve now seen comments from the Republican Leader in the Senate suggesting that they may want to travel down this road again.\xc2\xa0 But they will encounter the same position from the President that he held in October.\xc2\xa0 This is not something to be trifled with.\xc2\xa0 It is not something to be horse-traded over.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the full faith and credit of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are moving forward in our economy.\xc2\xa0 We are creating jobs, we are growing.\xc2\xa0 We need to create more and we need to grow faster and stronger.\xc2\xa0 And the last thing the American people want, the last thing our economy needs is that kind of brinksmanship again, that kind of threat over the American and global economy in return for some partisan objective that couldn\'t be achieved elsewhere -- perhaps repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 We could replay the whole movie.</p>\n<p>I don\'t think that will happen.\xc2\xa0 I said yesterday that we don\'t think that will happen.\xc2\xa0 But let me be clear that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position will not be any different next year than it was this year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask also about the Indian diplomat in New York?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any further information about whether she\xe2\x80\x99s been transferred to the Indian mission, and if that transfer would give her immunity from prosecution?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those are not details that I have for you.\xc2\xa0 I want to say that the United States and India enjoy a broad and deep friendship, and this isolated episode is not indicative of the close and mutually respectful ties that we share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We understand that this is a sensitive issue for many in India, and we are looking into the intake procedures surrounding this arrest to ensure that all standard procedures were followed and that every opportunity for courtesy was extended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would refer you to the Justice Department for details about the arrest, and you can look at the website for the Department of Justice, which has extensive information laid out by the U.S. Attorney in the southern district of New York regarding the visa fraud and false document charges made against the deputy consul general of India in New York.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any, in terms of her disposition or how this is being handled, any more details than Justice can provide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a big concern about the security of the U.S. missions in Delhi and other places.\xc2\xa0 They have removed the barricades.\xc2\xa0 Are you in touch with them?\xc2\xa0 And has the President been informed about it?\xc2\xa0 Is he up to date on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has been briefed on this issue, and I can tell you that the safety and security of our diplomats and consular officials in the field is a top priority.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with India to ensure that all of our diplomats and consular officials are being afforded full rights and protections under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.</p>\n<p>We have conveyed at high levels to the government of India our expectation that India will continue to fulfill all of its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\xc2\xa0 For more details about the embassy and consulates, I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How should the Russians view anything -- the U.S. delegation\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by the White House as anything other than a snub by the President of Vladimir Putin\'s Olympics?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they view it as a snub?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean because the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, first time in seven Olympics that there\'s no President, no member of the First Family, no Vice President, no former President leading the U.S. delegation.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, the President is extremely proud of our athletes and looks forward to cheering them on from Washington as they compete in the best traditions of the Olympic spirit.\xc2\xa0 He knows they will showcase to the world the best of America -- diversity, determination and team work.</p>\n<p>Now, the President\'s schedule does not allow him to travel to Sochi, but in his stead, he has asked a high-level delegation led by former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, and featuring former Olympian Brian Boitano and former Olympic coach Billie Jean King to represent the United States at the opening ceremonies, to represent the government.\xc2\xa0 Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns and former Olympians Caitlin Cahow, Eric Heiden and Bonnie Blair will represent the U.S. at the closing ceremonies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, this delegation represents the diversity that is the United States.\xc2\xa0 All our delegation members are distinguished by their accomplishments in government service, in civic activism and in sports.\xc2\xa0 And we are proud of each and every one of them and think they will serve as great ambassadors of the United States to the Olympic Games.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a message that you\'re trying to send on gay rights in particular?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that this delegation represents the diversity that is the United States.\xc2\xa0 Every member of that delegation is extremely accomplished, either in government service or in civic activism or, most especially, in sports.\xc2\xa0 So he\'s very proud of the delegation and the diversity it represents, and he looks forward, as every American does, to the competition and to the effort that American athletes will demonstrate when they compete in Sochi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but would you wave off the interpretation that clearly the United States and the Obama administration wants to send a message about Russia\'s questionable treatment of gay --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we need to -- I would simply say that that\xe2\x80\x99s not a message we would wait to send through this manner.\xc2\xa0 We have been very clear, the President has been very clear that he finds it offensive, the anti-LGBT legislation in Russia, for example.\xc2\xa0 And we take very clear and strong stands on that issue, as well as the curtailment of civil society in Russia, as well as the harassment caused to those who protest corruption in Russia.\xc2\xa0 And the issues we have with Russia we are very upfront about, and that includes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want this allegation to bring some attention to these issues.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that this delegation brings attention to the remarkable diversity of the United States as well as the success that the United States has had in sports, both at the Olympics and beyond.\xc2\xa0 It is also a demonstration of high-level success and civic activism as well as in government service.\xc2\xa0 And the President is proud to have this delegation both to the opening and to the closing ceremonies represent our nation and our government at a games that will obviously, as they also do, have the attention of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me ask you about the comments that John Podesta made in an article a couple of months ago.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they were made before he joined the administration, do you think John Podesta owes -- since he\xe2\x80\x99s coming in as a very senior advisor, I mean, is this the type of relationship this White House hopes to strike up with the House Republicans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you began to say does he owe an apology, and he clearly thought he did since he issued one very quickly.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the language exactly before me -- he said it was a case of his snark getting ahead of his judgment, and he expressed his longstanding admiration for the Speaker of the House and apologized to him.\xc2\xa0 So I think that reflects Mr. Podesta\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 And I think the speed with which he apologized --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s clearly concern that this could poison --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think John reflected his concern that it not reflect the approach he has taken in his past or will take when he arrives here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly following up on the Olympics -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting that there was not a message sent here with this delegation, are you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting that in the selection of this delegation we are sending the message that the United States is a diverse place and this delegation represents that diversity not because of the issues on which we disagree with Russia alone, but because of the remarkable accomplishments of every individual in that delegation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when the highest-ranking government official in this delegation is a deputy chief of staff --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a former Cabinet Secretary, the Homeland Security Cabinet Secretary, who is also now in a very big job as head of I think the largest --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the Vice President, the First Lady -- I mean, you had to be thinking about -- were you thinking of the so-called gay propaganda law when the White House was putting together this delegation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that we, as I said earlier, have made no bones about the fact that we strongly oppose and are offended by the anti-LGBT legislation in Russia.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear -- have not pulled any punches in talking about the fact that we expect Russia to conduct Olympic Games in Sochi that demonstrate full respect and regard for the participants in those games from all over the world and from all walks of life.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the purpose of any delegation to the games is to showcase the strengths of the country sending the delegation, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what this delegation does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President encourage members of this delegation to publicly express their disapproval of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s anti-gay policies at the opening ceremonies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has publicly expressed his disapproval of those policies.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect that this delegation will comport itself any differently than previous delegations have or that delegations are expected to comport themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The selection reflects the diversity of this country, the strength of this country, the brilliance and success of our athletes, as well as the nature of our civic activism and government service.\xc2\xa0 So the President is very proud to have the two delegations, both the one to the opening ceremonies and the one to the closing ceremonies to represent the United States government in Sochi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick question on the event with the moms in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 You said, because moms play a unique -- moms have a unique role to play.\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you -- is there a little gender stereo --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you do what your mom tells you to do?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do, mostly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the dads?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'re a dad.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a role to play here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wish I had that kind of power and influence over my children, but I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Now, I apologize to my father in saying that.\xc2\xa0 But I think this is a recognition of the role that moms play in their families.\xc2\xa0 And they, I think, bear truths to their children.\xc2\xa0 And one of the truths that we hope moms around the country will convey is that it is very important to get covered, to be insured, to protect themselves against the potential of falling ill with a debilitating disease or breaking a leg, or any kind of thing that can befall young people who might otherwise feel invincible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And with the Affordable Care Act, there is a unique opportunity now that did not exist before for young adults to take advantage of the accessibility of quality, affordable health care.\xc2\xa0 So many of these young adults will be able to get insurance for $50 a month or less, or $100 a month or less.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, those under 26 can avail themselves of the opportunity created by the Affordable Care Act to stay on their parents\' health plans, something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t impossible before this law passed and has been possible since it\'s passed.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not something that\'s just kicking in January 1st, as you know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s a remarkably useful benefit for families, middle-class families around the country.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re 19, let\xe2\x80\x99s say you don\xe2\x80\x99t go to college or you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting insurance through college, prior to this you could be in a tough spot.\xc2\xa0 You may be between jobs, between schools.\xc2\xa0 You may be employed somewhere where there\xe2\x80\x99s not employer-provided insurance.\xc2\xa0 And having that opportunity at that early stage in your life to stay on your parents\xe2\x80\x99 plan is extremely valuable.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the individuals, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the families, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the overall health of the nation, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the bottom line.\xc2\xa0 And in conveying all those messages, I think moms speak clearly and best, in many cases, to their children.</p>\n<p>Yes, sorry -- Wendell and then Athena.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to release the report from this intelligence review board, was that swayed by something he heard from the tech company CEOs yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 It was -- because of what I mentioned, we talked about, I talked about the likelihood that this would be released in January when the overall internal review would be completed and the President would be speaking to the results of that review and that work done by the various individuals involved in assessing our intelligence-gathering activities, especially signals intelligence.</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last days since Friday is there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting -- and I guess we should have expected that -- a lot of good reporters out there trying to get at this.\xc2\xa0 And in the interest of making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re reporting about what\xe2\x80\x99s in the review, or the review board\xe2\x80\x99s report, is accurate, we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly appropriate to put that out now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has it been scrubbed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And not since we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that decision.\xc2\xa0 It was always going to be publicly released, or at least for some time now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is some redaction to that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s redaction.\xc2\xa0 I think it has been completed in a way that allows it to be released publicly is my understanding.\xc2\xa0 We can get more detail on how that process worked for you.\xc2\xa0 But it will be released publicly in a way that is safe to be done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how much information are we actually going to get?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A lot.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long of the report are we actually going to get?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A lot.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s long.\xc2\xa0 And I insist that everybody read the entire thing before they report on it, or maybe I should get your mom to call you and tell you to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- you, as has every White House press secretary, talked about polls going up, polls going down.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s polls have been going down of late.\xc2\xa0 But I want to ask you about a particular poll that speaks to his honesty and trustworthy; that\xe2\x80\x99s gone down.\xc2\xa0 Is that a different thing for the President to see that go down than to see job approval rating or something like that go down, something you can blame on the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think all of these numbers that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing reflect the dissatisfaction across the country that Americans have with dysfunction in Washington.\xc2\xa0 As the President said the other day, just since fall began they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the government shut down, they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen default threatened, they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a terrible rollout of a very important domestic policy initiative and the website.\xc2\xa0 And they understandably might wonder what\'s going on here -- why can\'t Washington function in a way that works for the American people, that produces positive results for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I think that you\'ve seen poll numbers for everyone -- Republicans and Democrats, including the President -- reflect that unhappiness and dissatisfaction.\xc2\xa0 I would not be surprised by that, I am not surprised by that; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone here is surprised by that.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the trustworthiness question would seem to speak directly to the President\'s promise:\xc2\xa0 If you like your health care --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President addressed this head on, addressed why it was important to him to take action to mitigate that problem, and spent a lot of time talking to the colleague to your left there about that very issue.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can\'t speak to what specific poll result is related to what event in Washington or what perception of the President or others here.\xc2\xa0 What I am very confident of is that a lot of Americans are fed up with how Washington has been functioning, or dysfunctioning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the good news, as we approach Christmas and the holiday season here, is that we have seen of late an improvement.\xc2\xa0 Now, the bar is very low here when it comes to Congress working.\xc2\xa0 But Congress worked in the last several weeks -- Chairman Ryan, Senator Murray -- Chairman Murray came together and worked out, hammered out a budget compromise that is not the grand bargain and is not a solution to all our ills, but it is a significant bipartisan achievement.\xc2\xa0 And it will directly result in stronger growth and job creation, and the certainty it creates will produce added economic benefits, added security to the American people and the middle class in particular.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 And both sides deserve credit for that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously not huge majorities of Republicans voted for it, but enough Republicans did that it\'s passed the House and it\'s going to pass the Senate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And Chairman Ryan deserves credit, Speaker Boehner and others deserve credit for that.\xc2\xa0 And the President is happy to see it and he looks forward to signing it.\xc2\xa0 And we hope, as I said earlier, that it will maybe create a little momentum behind efforts to tackle other challenges in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 Comprehensive immigration reform is screaming out for the House of Representatives to follow the Senate\'s lead and pass it, and reap the benefits of passing it, economically; the benefits to our security; the benefits to the middle class and to our businesses.\xc2\xa0 That would be a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And the President is eager to share credit for that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So maybe, if that happens and if Congress comes together and produces bipartisan compromises on other issues, maybe those numbers for everyone will go up, including -- rarely mentioned in these conversations -- are the abysmally low, historically low numbers for Congress.\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the same -- when you\'re out in the country and you don\'t live and breathe this stuff every day, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency to just think the whole place is to blame for the dysfunction and failures and you don\'t single out individuals or parties, necessarily.\xc2\xa0 You think they\xe2\x80\x99re all failing you.\xc2\xa0 You think that your representatives in Washington were sent here to help you, and instead they\xe2\x80\x99re focusing on their own political ambition, their own primary, their own leadership race -- whatever it is -- instead of -- or listening to constituents who have the loudest voices here in Washington instead of the folks in their communities.</p>\n<p>Maybe that will change.\xc2\xa0 And we should, at the very least, not exaggerate what we\'ve seen in the last few weeks, but we should acknowledge it and hope that it is a sign of more cooperation to come.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on health care?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, with the event -- the moms event in the Oval Office and then the radio interviews this afternoon, the First Lady is playing a bigger role in this health care push.\xc2\xa0 What is it that the White House feels that she brings to the table that\'s particularly powerful or persuasive?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s a mom, so in this event I think -- although her children are not old enough now to avail themselves to staying on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 insurance or purchase it on their own -- I think two things.\xc2\xa0 One, she\xe2\x80\x99s just a great messenger.\xc2\xa0 And while she didn\xe2\x80\x99t develop the Affordable Care Act or wasn\xe2\x80\x99t involved in the policy process, she believes deeply in the need to deliver affordable, quality health insurance to the American people, and in this case to make sure that young people, young Americans understand the value of being covered, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans or on plans that they can get themselves, affordably.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very helpful assistance, piece of assistance that she\xe2\x80\x99s providing here by getting this message out with the President, that moms around the country can play a big role in getting this message out to their kids and to other members of their family.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this reflect any concern that the numbers are low when it comes to young and healthy people signing up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think I said the other day, this has always been an issue.\xc2\xa0 I think that the mix of the population that enrolls in the exchanges is something that experts look at.\xc2\xa0 We, broadly speaking, remain very pleased with the significant increase in both traffic and enrollment on healthcare.gov, and we will, when we get the data, be able to make more assessments about how those populations break down.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s always been the case that reaching all Americans and including and, perhaps, in particular, young Americans has been part of the plan, and that\'s what we\'re doing.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of young Americans out there who, because they believe they can\'t get sick, don\'t feel like they need to make the expense -- or bear the expense, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s modest -- $50 or less, $100 or less per month -- to purchase insurance.\xc2\xa0 And part of this effort is to explain why it is the right thing to do and the safe and wise thing to do, and the healthy thing to do to get covered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more to get your reaction.\xc2\xa0 AHIP announced today that anyone who pays their first month\'s premium by January 10th will have coverage, health insurance coverage, retroactive to January 1st.\xc2\xa0 Can I get your reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen that report.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been working with all stakeholders to make this transition as smooth as possible.\xc2\xa0 We created a lot of problems with the poor performance of the website at the launch.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve been catching up, as we\'ve made improvements to the website and made other adjustments to help smooth the transition.\xc2\xa0 So again, I don\'t have that specific report so I don\'t want to speak for that organization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, clearly, we have been working with issuers, insurers to work with the states and within the marketplaces to try to make this transition as smooth as possible so that those who enrolled in order to get insurance coverage on January 1st are able to do so.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s part of a broader effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I noted this week and last, it\'s the number-one priority at CMS is to focus on those backend issues, which is the forms that are sent to the carrier.\xc2\xa0 Once you select a plan and you fill out the information, that information is sent to the carrier of the plan to make sure they\'re accurate, to make sure that all the information that\'s necessary to have that policy kick in is taken care of.\xc2\xa0 And that includes making sure that those who have enrolled, individuals are in communication with their carriers about when premiums are due, first payments are due so that coverage kicks in.</p>\n<p>Bill.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll get Bill, then Mark and Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wondered, will the President have any kind of reaction to the release of this report today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will have a readout of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I do not expect that you\'ll see the President speaking to this today.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll have a readout.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I mean, even if you\'re repeating his words, is he going to say something about the fact of this report and about what its release portends?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would not expect that, because as I noted, it is a long report, and we want the time to assess it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he met with the board this morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'d like to know what he thinks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is not going to make snap judgments.\xc2\xa0 He is going to look at it and assess it.\xc2\xa0 And, as I said, the overall internal review won\xe2\x80\x99t be completed until January.\xc2\xa0 After that, the President will have more to say about it and more to say about the outcomes of that work.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t anticipate those kind of remarks or judgment being made today or this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he even happy that there came to be a report?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 He is the instigator for the review board and for the product it created, and is extremely grateful, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But only because of the leaks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s no question that the disclosures have created a lot of intensity and focus on this issue.\xc2\xa0 But the President I think has been very proactive and aggressive in making sure that this internal review is being done and that not just here but at PCLOB, and in making clear that he has made changes and will make changes based on these assessments -- changes that will be important even as we make clear that the work that\xe2\x80\x99s done by the NSA and other parts of the intelligence community is vital to the security of the United States and the American people and our allies, and that we will not compromise the work that we do on behalf of the security of the United States, but that it is necessary to review what we do and to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not just -- because of the technology we have and the capacity we have, we\xe2\x80\x99re not just collecting intelligence because we can but that it\xe2\x80\x99s focused and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it because we should and must in order to achieve those goals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but without the leaks there would have been no review.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you go back -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this discussion -- go back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech earlier in the year before the disclosures, I think he spoke about the overall need to assess our posture in the aftermath of 10 years of war.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear from what he said then that these issues -- intelligence and not just military operations -- were very much on his mind.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t argue with you that this has heightened focus both here in the White House and, more broadly, within the administration as well as of course around the United States and the globe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he is very grateful to those he asked to perform this review and to the members of PCLOB and others who have been doing some very important work on these issues so that he can make some decisions about which recommendations he\xe2\x80\x99ll act on, which he won\xe2\x80\x99t, which he\xe2\x80\x99ll make adjustments to and then act on.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an extremely dense and substantive exercise, which is why, in response to a 300-plus page report and 46 recommendations, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to come out with an assessment five minutes later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as you saw again yesterday there is still a great risk to U.S. military people in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the current read here on the deadline for Karzai to sign onto the security agreement?\xc2\xa0 Is it still December 31st?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that we believe the bilateral security agreement ought to be signed right away, as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 We welcome the loya jirga\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming endorsement of the BSA and continued partnership with the United States, and we are prepared to sign the agreement -- which is an opportunity to strengthen and sustain the partnership between the U.S. and Afghanistan, to support Afghans in achieving lasting peace, security, and development.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The negotiation is over, and if we cannot conclude a BSA promptly then we will be forced to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not a future that we want and it is not in Afghanistan\'s interest, but that is what we will plan for without prompt conclusion of the BSA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is promptly?\xc2\xa0 And does Susan Rice\'s warning to Karzai still stand that no deal by the end of the year would force the U.S. to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date to place on it except that we need it promptly.\xc2\xa0 There is not time here.\xc2\xa0 We cannot, as has been suggested, wait for further developments in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 This was negotiated in good faith; the negotiation is over.\xc2\xa0 There are no changes that are going to be made to that agreement.\xc2\xa0 It can either be signed or not signed, and we believe the message is clear, emanating from Washington and from our representatives in Kabul, that it\'s time to sign this agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, she told Karzai that if there\'s no deal by the end of the year it would force the U.S. to plan to pull out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that reflects what I just said.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date specific on it, but there\'s not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is a date, though.\xc2\xa0 You said prompt, and she said end of the year.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\'d refer you to what the National Security Advisor has said.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying and I think others have said is this has to happen quickly.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- the assessments that NATO has to make in early 2014 are going to happen, and there is no time for waiting for this to be further considered in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been endorsed overwhelmingly by the loya jirga, and it was negotiated in good faith for quite a long time.\xc2\xa0 So we want to see a signature as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it truly in America\'s best security interest to keep U.S. troops there at all?\xc2\xa0 Why are we doing this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made very clear, Connie, that -- the President has made clear that whatever remaining troops presence there might be would be focused solely on counterterrorism and on the training and support of Afghan forces.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to winding down this war and America\'s direct engagement in this war.\xc2\xa0 But it is in U.S. interests to maintain that, in our view, counterterrorism presence and that presence that assists in the training and support of Afghan forces.</p>\n<p>The President, when he reviewed our policy towards Afghanistan I think -- and we\'re going way back now, when we came here and I was working for the Vice President -- it was noted that when you went to Afghanistan and talked to our representatives there, both military and civilian, and asked them what our policy was, you got different answers from everybody.\xc2\xa0 And that was what we inherited.</p>\n<p>And what the President instituted was a very clear-eyed, deliberate review of our policy and our objectives, and produced a policy that was very clear:\xc2\xa0 We are there because we were attacked, and we are there to go after those who attacked us, al Qaeda, and to take steps necessary so that Afghanistan can and the government there can maintain stability so that Afghanistan does not become, again, a harbor for al Qaeda or other terrorists who have the objective of attacking the United States or American citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we have, because of the remarkable skill and bravery of our troops as well as those not in uniform who have worked on this effort, made enormous progress in going after al Qaeda core in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\xc2\xa0 That was our number-one objective.\xc2\xa0 And when the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy emerged and began to be implemented, the clarity of that policy I think has served U.S. interests very clearly.\xc2\xa0 And those same interests are the reason why we have taken the approach in the bilateral security agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0 But we will not be able to maintain a troop presence there if this document is not signed.</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you clarify why the report is being released this afternoon?\xc2\xa0 You said to Wendell that it was to sort of head off -- to make sure that reports about it were accurate.\xc2\xa0 And earlier you had said because it was a response to the reporting that had been inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 Have there been inaccuracies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is there have been some inaccuracies.\xc2\xa0 And what we think is the right and appropriate thing to do, given that and given that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect reporting on this to stop even if we asked for that, that it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly appropriate to release it now, and those who are reporting on it can report on the document instead of second-hand of third-hand conversations about the document.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you here, or this afternoon perhaps, spell out what the inaccuracies were?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll just point to the document because the document will be accurate, because it will be the document.\xc2\xa0 And you guys, the media critics, can decide which reports were reflective of what\xe2\x80\x99s in the document.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On some other reports, is the White House doing anything at all to speed the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee\xe2\x80\x99s year-old report now on the interrogation practices of the CIA?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been briefed on that in a while so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question and get back to you.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the review board initiate or request that the report be made public, or was that something you all decided kind of unilaterally, if that makes sense?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the chicken-or-the-egg question here.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re in ongoing discussions.\xc2\xa0 There was always -- or it had for a long time been the view that it would be released publicly.\xc2\xa0 And I think the assessment was made jointly that it be released.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know Jackie asked this but -- and not to devolve into self-loathing, but the press gets things wrong sometimes, and you all generally don\xe2\x80\x99t respond or release a report just because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got something wrong.\xc2\xa0 So why now?\xc2\xa0 Is it something so -- is it just because this deals with national security, because of the severity?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is a big issue or question here.\xc2\xa0 I think it was just a decision that it could be released now.\xc2\xa0 We had originally planned to release it in concert with the conclusion of the overall internal review, because this is just one piece of it.\xc2\xa0 But given the reporting on it and the recognition that a release of the actual document would allow those with interest in it to report accurately about it, that it might as well be released early.</p>\n<p>Julianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Congress getting copies of the report as well, or are they being briefed separately?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I think once it\xe2\x80\x99s released, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everybody who wants one will be able to get one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re not getting anything earlier or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 Early, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, but again, let me be clear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President share the report with the tech executives yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he did.\xc2\xa0 They had a long conversation about overall issues regarding the disclosures and concerns that the executives have expressed and expressed about the disclosures, and that was a very constructive conversation in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 But I do not believe that the report was shared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you be doing any briefings for the press with the report, or are you just going to drop it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that our view is that, both internally and externally, it merits a substantive assessment.\xc2\xa0 But we may -- I mean, if we have more on that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple for you.\xc2\xa0 First, on the Olympics.\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to speak with or invite the delegation to the White House before they go to Sochi?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 He obviously has a very close relationship with his former Homeland Security Secretary.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when the last time they spoke was.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the whole delegation, if there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a visit I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the NSA review, in the first statement after the report landed, it seemed like you guys ruled out dividing NSA from Cyber Command, which also means that NSA won\xe2\x80\x99t get a civilian leader.\xc2\xa0 Was that ever on the table or was that something that was ruled out very quickly in this process?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the process, but I know that it was considered, that there was a discussion about suggestions along those lines, and a decision was made that I think has been announced or revealed to maintain the unitary command and therefore a military command.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long that question was on the table.\xc2\xa0 I believe it was deliberated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In your statement, you said this is an isolated incident, but India is not taking it that way.\xc2\xa0 It has taken serious steps which will derail the strengthening of relations that this administration has been taking for the past five years.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe the same way, it is affecting the relationship between the two countries?\xc2\xa0 And does the President believe that diplomats should be treated the way she was treated in New York?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, say the last part again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the diplomats will be treated the way he was treated in New York?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we said that we are looking into the intake procedures, which is, I guess, a bureaucratic term for the procedures by which people are arrested in these circumstances.\xc2\xa0 And we want to ensure that all standard procedures were followed and that every opportunity for courtesy was extended.\xc2\xa0 Now, thus far, all indications are that standard procedures were followed, but because we recognize that this is a very sensitive issue in India, we are continuing to review exactly what happened in this case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To your first question, I think that it merits -- it\xe2\x80\x99s worth repeating what I said in answer earlier, which is that the United States and India enjoy a broad and deep friendship, and this isolated incident is not, in our view, indicative of the close and mutually respectful ties that we share, and we look forward to continuing to work on that relationship and make it stronger.\xc2\xa0 We are, again, reviewing what happened in this case.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Justice and to the southern district of New York, the U.S. Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office there for more details about the charges and the arrest itself.\xc2\xa0 But again, we view it as an isolated incident even as we assess what exactly happened in the intake procedure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House concerned the impact this incident would have on India-U.S. bilateral relations, especially after the successful visit of Prime Minister --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would express that concern by making clear that we view this as an isolated incident that does not reflect on our relationship.\xc2\xa0 And we will obviously consult with our counterparts in India about it and we will also obviously discuss with them the vital need to maintain the security of U.S. diplomatic and consular officials in India because that is a top priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a clarification on something before you go, on the NSA?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the story came out about the metadata collection program at the NSA -- all the compiling of all those phone records -- the President of course defended the program and said that it had saved lives.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering, is there any change in that position?\xc2\xa0 Does the President still see that as a central, essential program that saves American lives?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President does believe that the programs that have been legislated by Congress and reviewed by the FISA Court are necessary for our security.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to what he has said as well as many others have said about it.\xc2\xa0 And I hasten to emphasize, again, that in this review, our priority remains, his priority remains the safety and security of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And it is not an objective of this review to in any way compromise our security, and he will not do that.</p>\n<p>But he does believe that we can take steps to refine our practices and make sure that we are collecting intelligence, gathering intelligence in a way that serves our security needs in a focused way and not just because we can because we have the capacity to do so.\xc2\xa0 But, first and foremost, the security of the United States, the security of the American people are the President\'s priorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, all.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:44 P.M.
