EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How are you guys this morning?\xc2\xa0 How was the breakfast?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Heavy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It looked a little heavy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s apple pie.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\'s wrong with that?\xc2\xa0 Apple pie for breakfast sounds interesting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you have anything?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I had just a bagel.\xc2\xa0 It was more than I needed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Fire away.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama said before he left that he had a conversation directly with President Clinton -- we hadn\'t heard that before.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a bit of a readout about that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they talked for a few minutes right before President Obama went out to speak with you all about his reaction to the journalists being released.\xc2\xa0 The President thanked him for a great job and knew how much the families appreciated the President\'s trip and continued service to the country.\xc2\xa0 And I assume they\'ll -- I know they hope to get together sometime soon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The two Presidents?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you envision President Obama calling into service President Clinton in other ways?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, this was a private mission that President Clinton did, and I know the President is enormously thankful for his service.\xc2\xa0 And look, I think if the President is ever looking for people to help, former Presidents are always a pretty good group to try.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did the events of the past 24 hours change in any way the U.S. relationship with North Korea?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I think first and foremost, as I\'ve said and I think we talked about last night, this is -- we view these as different events.\xc2\xa0 And I would say secondly -- the best way to change our relationship with North Korea would be for the North Koreans to decide that it\'s time to live up to the responsibilities and the agreements that they themselves entered into.\xc2\xa0 Our goal is a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 And the North Koreans can and should live up to those agreements.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching topics slightly and then we might go back to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the swearing-in of President Ahmadinejad in Iran today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me correct a little bit of what I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I denoted that Mr. Ahmadinejad was the elected leader of Iran.\xc2\xa0 I would say it\'s not for me to pass judgment on.\xc2\xa0 He\'s been inaugurated, that\'s a fact.\xc2\xa0 Whether any election was fair, obviously the Iranian people still have questions about that and we\'ll let them decide that.\xc2\xa0 But I would simply say he\'s been inaugurated and we know that is simply a fact.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you recognize him as the leader, elected fairly or not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not for -- it\'s not for me or for us to denote his legitimacy, except to acknowledge the fact.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe the election was fair?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not for us to pass judgment on.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s for the Iranian people to decide, and obviously there are many that still have a lot of questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple logistical questions.\xc2\xa0 Back on Korea, was the plane on the ground when the President spoke to Clinton, do you know?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 This was -- President Obama called him from right outside the Oval Office after the two journalists and former Vice President Gore had spoken and before -- but before he went out and spoke.\xc2\xa0 So there were just a few minutes between there that they connected.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who paid for the plane for this private mission, and what kind of a plane was that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d direct that to the Clintons -- to Clinton\'s group.\xc2\xa0 It was not a government aircraft and not paid for by the government.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not paid for --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Private mission.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On today, Robert, why is today not a town hall meeting?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the -- why the logistical set-up is what it is, except I know the President wants to go and make an announcement about some very important -- the largest investment in electric battery technology, and have a chance to -- ow, sorry, I twisted my ankle last week and just tweaked it again -- the President wants to share that news with a county in Indiana that\'s been hit tremendously hard.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow -- no concern from you all that you are going to get a lot of questions about:\xc2\xa0 you were here in February, things have gotten worse, what\'s happening, why aren\'t you doing more?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, look, as I said earlier today, look, we\'ve spent a lot of -- we\'ve spent a lot of time in places that are bad off economically, and that\'s largely because most of the country is bad off economically.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at some of the reports today, you know, there are elected officials in the county that are pleased with the impact of the recovery plan that it\'s been able to have.\xc2\xa0 You know, you\'ve got -- we\'re going to announce a grant for this electric battery technology that\'s going to employ folks in a factory that once housed an RV manufacturer, which --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s in the remarks.\xc2\xa0 And I know there are some, you know, there was I think a recent announcement that one of the RV companies is going to expand and bring some more people back.\xc2\xa0 So, look, the President will tell this community, as he\'s told many others, and what he told them in February, which is:\xc2\xa0 It took us a while to get here.\xc2\xa0 You know, a year ago, the unemployment rate was 10 points lower in this area of Indiana.\xc2\xa0 So this has built up over a year, and it\'s going to take some time to dig our way out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the President believes that the announcement today, though, represents the type of innovation and investment in a new economic foundation that can lay the groundwork for some long-term employment prospects for this area through clean-energy jobs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, please, just to make sure I understand?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to figure out -- for the employees of this company, what\'s in this announcement for them?\xc2\xa0 Are they -- is this company getting any help, or this area specifically?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll announce a specific -- a specific awarding grant as part of about I think $2.4 billion in battery -- electric battery grants throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 I forget how many individual ones, but this is one of them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But presumably the employees of this RV company are going to have an opportunity for new employment?\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to make that connection.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, I think whether it\'s directed -- let me look through the remarks one more time, so I don\'t confuse the two.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President have a feeling on why North Korea decided to let the two Americans go?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President does and I haven\'t heard anything -- anybody but staff.\xc2\xa0 I know, again, the call that we walked you guys through last night simply was that journalists had mentioned that the North Koreans had said to them this would be an avenue for release.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question on that.\xc2\xa0 Did President Clinton brief President Obama today during their conversation about his talks with Kim Jong-il?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, it wasn\'t long enough to do that.\xc2\xa0 At some point, I think very soon, members of the team of the NSC will sit down with President Clinton and get a debrief on the events, just as the NSC guys sat down with President Clinton before he left over the weekend.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say earlier that you think President Obama will meet with President Clinton?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sometime soon.\xc2\xa0 Sometime soon.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to leave the impression that that\'s in the next few days.\xc2\xa0 Nothing is scheduled, but I know they both talked about hoping to get together soon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did President Clinton have -- and you may have discussed this on the call last night -- any authorization to make any kind of offers or suggestions for rewards for releasing these journalists?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There were no messages that were passed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">All right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  10:58 A.M.
