Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:46 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Monday.\xc2\xa0 I hope you had a restful weekend.\xc2\xa0 March certainly strolled in like a lion; hopefully the lamb is going to appear here sometime soon, I hope.</p>\n<p>Jim, do you want to get us started with questions today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if the President had a chance to watch Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s speech to AIPAC and if you all have a reaction.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he did.\xc2\xa0 But what I can say is that the reaction here is I think as was appropriately characterized in the remarks that were delivered by Ambassador Power prior to the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and will be followed up by the remarks from the National Security Advisor this evening, which is that the relationship between the United States and Israel is one that has been strong for generations for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 It has been strengthened under the leadership of this President, and it is a relationship that is enduring not just because of our shared national security interests, but also because of the deep cultural ties that we have between our people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We share values.\xc2\xa0 We share a system of government.\xc2\xa0 And that is indicative of all that we have in common.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the President has pursued policies that have been interested in strengthening that relationship even further.\xc2\xa0 And I think whether you talk about the United States\xe2\x80\x99 strong military support for Israel or the way the United States has routinely and consistently stood up for Israel in a variety of diplomatic fora even when no one else would, the relationship between the United States and Israel is an important one and one that has been strengthened under this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, over the past several weeks, the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s address to Congress has been described by the administration as political, as destructive to the Israeli-U.S. relationship, as a breach in protocol.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Secretary Kerry said that Prime Minister Netanyahu was welcome to speak in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Why the change in tone?\xc2\xa0 Why not adopt that tone from the beginning and perhaps avoid a whole tense episode in U.S.-Israeli relations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I think the point of what Secretary Kerry was discussing is something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say from here many times, which is that as the Prime Minister of Israel, he gets to set his own schedule and he gets to take the actions that he believes are consistent with his own objectives, whatever they may be.\xc2\xa0 And that has been true from the beginning and this has been true even in other situations when we\xe2\x80\x99ve had differences of opinion with the Israeli leadership even on entirely different topics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For example, this past summer, we repeatedly reaffirmed the right of the Israelis to take steps related to their security that they believed were in their best interests in terms of confronting extremists in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 There were times where the United States expressed concerns about that strategy and, in some cases, in the way that it was implemented.\xc2\xa0 But at each turn, we reaffirmed the right of the Israeli political leadership to make decisions about what they believe is necessary to defend their country.\xc2\xa0 This is consistent with our view that it\xe2\x80\x99s the Prime Minister of Israel who\xe2\x80\x99s able to determine his own schedule and take the steps that he believes are necessary to communicate or to represent his country.</p>\n<p>We, however, have indicated that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that any steps that anybody takes should not be construed as subjecting the relationship between the United States and Israel to partisan politics, that if we reduce the relationship between our two countries to just a relationship between two political parties, that\'s going to have a negative impact on the relationship between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately that has been something that we have -- as you point out -- expressed some concerns about in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that the U.S. worries about its security whereas Israel worries about its own survival, and therefore, the view of Iran might be different in both places?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly would allow that the differences -- that there are differences of perspective when it comes to a variety of national security issues.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 What the President has put foremost in his mind when confronting a wide range of threats across the globe is the U.S. national security interests.\xc2\xa0 That\'s at the top of the list.</p>\n<p>Now, because of our strong ties to Israel, because they are our closest ally in a very volatile region, because of the deep values that we share, it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all uncommon for those interests to overlap.\xc2\xa0 In many cases, and I would say even in the vast majority of cases, our priorities are consistent with the priorities that are articulated by Israel\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership.<br/>\n\tThe best example I can give you is actually when it comes to Iran and their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s the policy of the United States that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 This is a value and a goal that is shared by the Israeli Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, Secretary Kerry met with Foreign Minister Lavrov today.\xc2\xa0 What was the purpose of that?\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t seem to go very well, so I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, in the aftermath of reports of breaches in the Minsk accord and the murder in Moscow last week, what was the purpose of that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not gotten a specific readout of that meeting, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for that. But I can tell you that we have -- that this administration has a number of diplomatic engagements over the course of this week to continue to explore the situation in Ukraine and to express our concerns about the continued efforts of Russia and the separatists that they back to flout the agreement that they signed just a couple of weeks ago in Minsk.</p>\n<p>We continue to see that, while there are some preliminary reports of some heavy weapons being withdrawn, that there continue to be efforts by the separatists and the Russians to prevent the OSCE monitors from evaluating exactly where those weapons are being withdrawn to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remind everybody, including those who signed the agreement, apparently, that Russia and the separatists are supposed to allow the OSCE monitors full and unfettered access to areas of conflict.\xc2\xa0 And that is not something that the Russian-backed separatists have followed through on, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a source of concern not just here in the United States but by the other parties that have signed on to that agreement.</p>\n<p>A couple of other points.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, over the weekend you saw that the Vice President had a telephone conversation with the Ukrainian President.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned already that Secretary Kerry met with his Russian counterpart in Geneva today.\xc2\xa0 And I believe this was announced at the end of last week, but a week from today, the President will be hosting here at the White House European Council President Donald Tusk, and that will also be an opportunity for us to discuss some of these issues with him as well.</p>\n<p>Julia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President disappointed on Friday night to have to sign a bill funding for the Department of Homeland Security for just another week?\xc2\xa0 And what is he doing in this week to ensure that Congress will pass a long-term funding bill?\xc2\xa0 Is he reaching out at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President certainly was disappointed to have to sign that one-week extension.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy, and it reflected a bad choice by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, the House should have acted -- as the Senate did -- in bipartisan fashion to pass a full year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that did not include any politically motivated riders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the fact that the President had to sign a seven-day extension doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just reflect a bad decision made by the Republican leadership in the House, it reflects the failed leadership of the Republican leadership in the House.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that Republican leaders will do what they should have done last week, which is allow the House of Representatives to vote on a clean, full year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for them to do so is that it is clearly in the best interest of the American people for the Department of Homeland Security to get funding and certainty around their funding levels.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It also is a good thing to do because we know it will pass with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 All of the hard work on this has been done at the end of last year; that Democrats and Republicans sat down together and negotiated the appropriate spending levels in that bill to make sure that all of the important programs at the Department of Homeland Security were funded at the appropriate level.\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity, or border security, or port security, funding for the TSA, funding for the Secret Service, all of those funding levels represent policy choices that required bipartisan compromise and cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And that hard work was done.\xc2\xa0 That agreement was hammered out and it passed through the Senate with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful it will do the same in the House this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but on outreach, I mean, I know on Friday we saw that the President reached out to Democratic leadership.\xc2\xa0 Is he changing his strategy at all this week?\xc2\xa0 Is he speaking to Speaker Boehner?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything he is doing to reach out to the other side of the aisle on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific phone calls to read out to you, but I can tell you that so much of this dispute has been a dispute between the Republican leadership in the Senate and a Republican leader in the House.\xc2\xa0 And the irony is, is that the leaders -- those two Republican leaders signed an op-ed the day after the election, touting the new Republican majority in the Congress, it was headlined, \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can get Congress going.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And, unfortunately, over the last couple of months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen exactly the opposite.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, though, that cooler heads will prevail and a smarter decision for the country will be made and the House of Representatives will be allowed to vote on and pass a full year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the police task force, recommendations were announced today.\xc2\xa0 Advocates are applauding this, but say that they want to see how it plays out.\xc2\xa0 How can the federal government tell local law enforcement how they should implement these changes, especially if they don\xe2\x80\x99t put money behind it in the form of grants?\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans to back up these recommendations with funding?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Julia.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that over the course of the last couples of months this policing task force that represents a variety of perspectives on law enforcement has held public hearings across the country.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken testimony from more than 100 witnesses just in the space of two months.\xc2\xa0 I think that reflects a seriousness of purpose with which these dedicated professionals have taken on this task.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly appreciative of their work.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to remain on the job for another 30 days as the President and other members of his administration evaluate their report, and that will give them ample time to conduct any follow-up if needed.</p>\n<p>There are several things that the President, however, is doing right away.\xc2\xa0 The first is he is directing all federal law enforcement agencies to carefully review the task force report so that if there are any recommendations that are applicable to federal law enforcement officers, that they can be implemented right away.\xc2\xa0 The second thing that he is going to do is ask the Department of Justice to examine what sort of public-private partnerships could be formed to advance the goals that are outlined in the report.</p>\n<p>And then, finally, as it goes to your specific question, the President has asked the Community Oriented Policing Services office at the Department of Justice to take responsibility for advancing the work of the task force, including prioritizing grant funding to law enforcement agencies that meet appropriate benchmarks that are related to these recommendations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So to the extent that there is already funding in the pipeline to implement some of these proposals, the President wants to get that funding expedited, and at a minimum prioritized.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately what we have here are a collection of best practices and recommendations from experts, and they will be passed on to law enforcement organizations across the country. What we know about these law enforcement organizations is that, by and large, they are just as committed as the administration is to trying to strike the right balance to -- well, in terms of trying to build trust with the communities that they serve and protect.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is it will allow them to be more effective as they do their job, but also allow their officers to do that job more safely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so this will continue to be a priority of the administration.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice will principally have the role of taking it from here and making sure that it gets implemented not just among federal law enforcement officers, but also in communities across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the DHS issue, last week you said that if the President felt like he needed to call Speaker Boehner or sit down with somebody on the Republican side, that he would do that.\xc2\xa0 So as this got down to the wire, did he feel that it was not necessary?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think principally because it was clear to everyone who was looking, Democrats and Republicans, that allowing the Department of Homeland Security to lapse their funding would be bad for the national security of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It certainly would not be a good outcome for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the other thing that was also clear is that there was strong bipartisan support in the Senate for passing a full-year budget for the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I notice that the House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was on a program over the weekend talking about this proposal, and he talked about how 57 percent of the United States Senate was supportive of the Collins amendment.\xc2\xa0 These are the provisions that would undermine the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to implement his executive actions to reform our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Well, by that measure, there are actually 68 percent of the United States Senate that supports a clean, full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security -- that essentially supports taking politics out of the equation for once and funding the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, there were also 68 Democrats and Republicans in the last Senate who supported common-sense, compromise immigration reform legislation -- something that was also blocked by House Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So if we\'re going to evaluate things on that metric, we certainly would welcome the opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 And that would result in the House even considering and allowing a vote on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and to reform our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when it looked clear that the House was not going to do that, what the Senate did, did the President feel like his input -- if it was going to be directly to Speaker Boehner -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really make any difference?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President felt like it was clear what the choice was for the Republican leadership.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately that is because there have been previous discussions between the President and Republican -- and congressional leaders about the importance of funding the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, had spent an enormous amount of time over the last several weeks working with Democrats and Republicans to make sure they understood that funding the Department of Homeland Security for this year needed to be a priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so, again, ultimately what the House should do is exactly what the Senate did, which is to allow a vote on a clean, full year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s strong bipartisan support for this legislation, and we hope it will pass.\xc2\xa0 They should have done it last week.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the President had to sign a seven-day extension does reflect an abject failure of the leadership in the House.\xc2\xa0 But they have an opportunity to address that shortcoming by allowing this full year funding bill to go to the floor this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given what it looked like going in to the House starting to vote on what was then a three-week measure, was this outcome worse or better than what the President expected to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation and I think the American people\xe2\x80\x99s expectation is that members of Congress need to do their job.\xc2\xa0 And the most important job that they have, arguably, or at least the most important power that they have is the power of the purse and to ensure that government priorities are funded.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the President takes very seriously his responsibility to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 I would expect and the President would expect that congressional Republicans would take seriously their responsibility to ensure that those efforts are properly funded, or at least funded at all.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, it is the basic responsibility that House Republican leaders have this week.\xc2\xa0 We saw the bipartisan support and the bipartisan vote for this legislation in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see that bipartisan vote in the House as long as House Republican leaders will allow it to come up for a vote.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that before Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, on Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Today he laid out his purpose for coming to speak before Congress, which was to prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 We heard Samantha Power at virtually the same time say that that will never happen.\xc2\xa0 So is his speech then unnecessary?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s, you mean?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Is his coming here unnecessary if that\'s what he lays out his goal to be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately -- as I mentioned in response to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the Israeli Prime Minister to determine his own schedule.\xc2\xa0 And he can make his decisions about how it advances his agenda to speak wherever he wants.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is the United States of America, under the leadership of the U.S. President, Barack Obama, has implemented a policy to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon, because it is clearly in the national security interests of the United States for Iran not to obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we are pursuing an agreement that would verify that outcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, so then doesn\'t the administration see his coming here and giving this speech as unnecessary then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it is the responsibility of the Prime Minister to make his own decisions about where he wants to go.\xc2\xa0 But what should not be lost on anybody is the strategy that this President has put in place to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program is consistent with achieving our goal of ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>If you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me for just a minute, let me explain why we believe that\'s the case in the context of these diplomatic negotiations.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, these diplomatic negotiations or this diplomacy, these negotiations, will be resolved once we have succeeded in essentially shutting down four pathways to Iran acquiring the fissile material that\'s necessary to build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 The first is to deal with the enrichment capacity at the Natanz facility.\xc2\xa0 The second is to deal with the enrichment capacity at the Fordow facility.\xc2\xa0 The third is to deal with the plutonium enrichment capacity at the heavy-water reactor that\'s currently under construction at Arak.\xc2\xa0 And fourth, to ensure that Iran does not have the capacity to pursue a covert option at a facility that is not yet known to the international community.</p>\n<p>And at each stage, we\'re going to ensure that we are going to set back Iran\xe2\x80\x99s progress on a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that means essentially extending -- if we\'re successful in this effort -- and a diplomatic agreement will not be signed unless we are -- but if we\'re successful, we will essentially have extended the breakout period to one year.\xc2\xa0 And we have already heard from experts who have said that the current breakout period is only two or three months.\xc2\xa0 So we would substantially, with the successful completion of this agreement, roll back Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program in a way that would prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and then putting in place international monitors for an extended period of time to ensure that they\'re complying with this agreement.</p>\n<p>And the point that the President has repeatedly made is that if they indicate that they are not willing to comply with an agreement -- once one is signed -- then we continue to have all of these options on the table.\xc2\xa0 We can add additional sanctions to the mix if we feel like that would be successful.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll even have a military option that continues to be available to the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the pursuit if this agreement is one that does not foreclose additional steps in the future if necessary if Iran fails to live up to the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And, unfortunately, what we have seen from critics of this agreement is a refusal to offer up any sort of alternative other than the military option.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, is an important part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s consideration as he formulates this strategy and this policy.</p>\n<p>Nadia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try one more question on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s speech to Congress tomorrow will complicate the negotiation at this stage or affect in any way or shape the chances of getting an agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s because the international community is united as we continue to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about quite a bit before, the reason that we have been able to compel Iran to the negotiating table is because the United States put in place a very stringent sanctions regime against Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that has required the compliance and cooperation with the broader international community.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of other countries that rely much more heavily on importing Iranian oil than the United States does, and what that means is it means that there are other countries that are making substantial economic sacrifices to not purchase oil from Iran.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s because of that economic pressure and isolation that Iran has come to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And what we are hopeful that we can achieve in the context of these negotiations is to shutdown these four clear paths to the fissile material that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And if so -- and then put in place a monitoring regimen that would allow us to verify their compliance with the agreement, we would succeed in essentially ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to keep beating a dead horse, but, I mean, the Prime Minister described the trip as historical and he said that he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to protect Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0 So obviously he does not see an eye-to-eye to what you say --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you heard me say at the beginning of this briefing and as you heard Ambassador Power say in her remarks to AIPAC, the United States has made clear that our foreign policy goal is to ensure that Iran does obtain or acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That is our goal.\xc2\xa0 It is my understanding that that\xe2\x80\x99s a goal that is shared by the Israeli political leadership as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, I would allow the Israeli Prime Minister the prerogative of describing his trip however he would like.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that the President is making decisions about our foreign policy with the foreign policy interests of the United States at the forefront.\xc2\xa0 The good news for Prime Minister Netanyahu is that in almost every situation, what\xe2\x80\x99s good for the United States also happens to be good for Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to get your reaction to this ad against Susan Rice, that she\xe2\x80\x99s been accused of having a blind spot for genocide by a Jewish rabbi.\xc2\xa0 Just your reaction to that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a despicable attack and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that I was gratified to see be repudiated by the Israeli Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s office.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, the Israeli Prime Minister has articulated a different goal than what you did at this briefing.\xc2\xa0 You said the United States is committed to a position where Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 What Bibi Netanyahu said today, and what he\xe2\x80\x99s been saying all along, is the goal is to make sure Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the capability to build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Which he says -- and is -- a different view.\xc2\xa0 So what do you say about his view that the whole point of this effort is to ensure not just that Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a weapon, but that Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the ability to build a weapon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I assume that the Prime Minster will have an opportunity to elaborate on what he means when he says the ability to acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what he means.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s referring to an enrichment capability.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also talked about the fact that they have a ballistic missile program that would enable a delivery system for a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about.\xc2\xa0 When Iran has the ability to produce highly enriched uranium -- that is the fuel to make a nuclear bomb -- he believes that\xe2\x80\x99s a threat to his real survival because it puts them on a path to building a bomb.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And has he laid out a strategy for how to prevent them from -- how to accomplish the goal that he has laid out?\xc2\xa0 I guess the point is -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to speak for him any longer.\xc2\xa0 The point is he has not laid out that strategy.\xc2\xa0 The President has laid out a clear strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re working to achieve that would prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\tAnd that is a clearly stated foreign policy goal, and it is a priority that this President has made because it\'s in the clear national security interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It also happens to be in the national security interest of our closest ally in the region, Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is he correct, though, to say that your goal then is not to prevent Iran from getting the capability to build a bomb, it\'s to prevent them from getting a bomb?\xc2\xa0 You acknowledge there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if he says that there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference there he\xe2\x80\x99s allowed to do that.\xc2\xa0 The point that I\'m making --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between those two positions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess you could make the case that there is one.\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy for someone else to do that if they would like to.\xc2\xa0 The point is that we believe the President has made a strategic decision about what he believes is clearly in the best interest of the United States, and it happens to be in the best interest of Israel.</p>\n<p>No one else has laid out a strategy for how to accomplish what apparently the Prime Minster has laid out as his goal.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even laid out a strategy for how to accomplish his goal.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, I\'m not even sure that the military option that some people considered to be an alternative to the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, would even accomplish his goal, because it would require not just a detailed destruction of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, but it also would require the removal of knowledge that Iran has already obtained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the fact is the goal that the President has set out that would ensure that -- or that is consistent with our national security imperatives here in this country is to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the best way for us to do this is at the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 Those negotiations are underway, even as we speak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the other thing that I have not mentioned so far in this briefing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for everybody to realize is it continues to be the case that our likelihood of success when it comes to reaching a deal in the context of these negotiations is only, at best, 50/50.\xc2\xa0 There are difficult decisions that need to be made by the Iranian government in terms of their willingness to sign on to this agreement, and this President has made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sign a bad deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying the 50/50 thing.\xc2\xa0 The President has used that for a long time now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re getting down to the wire.\xc2\xa0 The deadline is the end of this month.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your sense? Has it gotten any more likely, any less likely?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s stayed about the same.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is, while there has been progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made in the context of the negotiations, there continued to be some significant gaps.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, all of this comes down to the likelihood of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership signing off on the deal.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that is very difficult to ascertain from afar.\xc2\xa0 And that is the biggest X factor that remains here, and it\'s one that makes us feel like, at best, our options of reaching an agreement are 50/50</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, you know there\xe2\x80\x99s a move in Congress to say that if a deal is reached, that it should go before the United States Senate for approval, or not.\xc2\xa0 And I understand the President would veto such a bill.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why Congress should not have a say in this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a major international agreement.\xc2\xa0 Why are you opposed to allowing Congress to have a say in this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, we have made as much progress as we have so far in these negotiations because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to work closely and successfully with Congress to pass and implement one of the toughest sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s ever been put in place against any country.\xc2\xa0 That has compelled Iran to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, ultimately, we can\xe2\x80\x99t put in place an additional hurdle for that agreement to overcome here at the 11th hour, that if the United States is going to sit at the table with our negotiating partners not just in Iran but with the rest of the international community, our P5-plus-1 partners, then we need to make sure that we can live up to our agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is an important role for Congress to play.\xc2\xa0 There has been on the front end in terms of getting us to this situation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the administration has continued to carefully brief on a regular basis in detailed fashion, even in classified settings, the details and progress that are being made in these negotiations, because the administration considers, frankly, Democrats and Republicans in Congress to be partners in this effort.\xc2\xa0 And, ultimately, when it comes to offering up statutory sanctions relief, essentially providing significant relief from the congressionally passed sanctions -- that will require congressional action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is, Jon, what we\xe2\x80\x99re envisioning as we work on this agreement is not offering significant sanctions relief at the beginning, that ultimately we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a phased agreement where Iran will start to take some steps and the international community will start to offer some relief. And that is consistent with verifying that Iran is serious about living up to their end of the deal.</p>\n<p>Justin.\xc2\xa0 You look much closer than you usually are, so congratulations on your new seat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about Orrin Hatch.\xc2\xa0 He, in an interview with The New York Times over the weekend, said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s corporate tax reform proposal was, \xe2\x80\x9cpretty well dead\xe2\x80\x9d to him.\xc2\xa0 And he said that neither Republicans, nor corporations would go for it because they\xe2\x80\x99d essentially be paying taxes that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already paid internationally.\xc2\xa0 This has been something that obviously the President has outlined repeatedly as kind of a top priority for him, working with congressional Republicans -- to hear the top Senate Finance Committee Chairman come out pretty strongly against this plan, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what your reaction is to it and where that leaves the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts on this.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, nobody in this building is surprised to hear that there is a senior Republican in the Congress indicating that he stands squarely with well-connected, wealthy corporations when it comes to the tax code.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the kind of the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans try to advance for decades now.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are squarely on the side of corporations and the President is squarely on the side of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>And there is a different of opinion when it comes to this.\xc2\xa0 But the President has put forward his own ideas about how he thinks that we can get this done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty common-sense proposal where we can actually close some loopholes that only benefit those wealthy and well-connected corporations that apparently are close friends with Senator Hatch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we can use that revenue to invest in the kinds of projects that benefit everybody -- certainly will continue to benefit those corporations when they are landing at a new airport, or moving their goods on a modern rail infrastructure, or moving those goods on a modern superhighway.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s clearly and consistent with the interests of the business community, but more importantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the interests of middle-class families in this country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to create jobs in the short term.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to make sure that we have more economic growth over the longer term. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that somebody who is focused on looking out for big business in Washington might have a difference of opinion when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s tax policies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, implicit in sort of that antagonism toward Senator Hatch, is this a concession?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a plan that you guys have --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He called our plan dead on arrival.\xc2\xa0 I thought I was pretty nice to him in contrast.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, this is a plan that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had for many years.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be getting a warm reception on the Hill, do you guys also see this as more of a signpost than anything that has a legitimate chance of passing in a Republican-controlled Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there has been an effort to put some more details and to add some tweaks to this to try to be more specific and to try to be clearer about what our policy goals are.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, those policy goals are about expanding economic growth and creating jobs for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And this tax approach is consistent with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The truth is there are other Republicans who have had somewhat better things to say about this approach in general, where there are some Republicans who have indicated that this could be an area of compromise, even if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t whole-heartedly embraced our specific proposal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to talk about.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to require some compromise on both sides, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about quite a bit over the last couple of months.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, if we reach a tax reform agreement, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to include some things that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xc2\xa0 It also will include some things that presumably congressional Republicans, particularly those like Senator Hatch that are close to wealthy corporations, they probably won\xe2\x80\x99t like either.\xc2\xa0 But the question is whether or not we can actually try to find some common ground in the middle that would allow us to advance the interests of the American people.</p>\n<p>One example of this, again, is a well-thought-out but robust investment in infrastructure in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that would benefit everybody and surely that\xe2\x80\x99s something that both Democrats and Republicans could come together around.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to see where this goes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bernie Sanders, maybe on the other side of the aisle up on Capitol Hill, has suggested that the White House could raise as much as $100 billion through using executive action to close corporate loopholes.\xc2\xa0 If your plan is kind of running into resistance with Republicans on Capitol Hill, is that an idea that you guys would embrace towards sort of all those holes that you just outlined?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for any sort of possible executive actions along those lines, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 But the President certainly has not indicated any reticence about using his executive authority to try to advance an agenda that benefits middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that there is some imminent announcement -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not, at least that I know of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it something under consideration?\xc2\xa0 Have you guys been looking at the tax codes --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has asked his team to examine the array of executive authorities that are available to him to try to make progress on his goal.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about any of those in any detail at this point, but the President is very interested in this avenue generally.</p>\n<p>Tommy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I have three quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I wanted to ask you about some comments that Senator John McCain made this morning on \xe2\x80\x9cMorning Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He said -- he was talking about ISIS, and he said he\xe2\x80\x99d spoken to a leader of a Middle Eastern country last week who told him, I\xe2\x80\x99m going back and telling the other Arab countries we have to develop our own plans, we cannot depend on the United States.\xc2\xa0 Is that a strategic goal of the United States, is to get Middle Eastern countries to depend on us to fight ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Tommy, the President has made clear that a core component of our strategy to defeat and to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is to build a broad international coalition of more than 60 countries.\xc2\xa0 Many of them are countries from the region, and we value their support, we value their contribution to this broader effort.\xc2\xa0 And by working together, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we can ultimately accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that kind of what you want them to do, is to strike out on their own a little bit more in this fight?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President does believe that part of our strategy, at least when it comes to Iraq, is building up the capacity of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces and Kurdish security forces to take this fight on their own and to take responsibility for the security situation in their own country.\xc2\xa0 Now, the President has been clear that the United States and our coalition partners will be there to assist with the training and equipping of those security forces, to even offer them advice where necessary.\xc2\xa0 The President also is prepared and has on many occasions to great effect used coalition military airpower to back up their efforts on the ground.\xc2\xa0 They have succeeded at some key points of rolling back ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s advances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can just give you a couple of examples that I had asked for here, that local forces in Iraq have undertaken significant offensive operations in Iraq against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done so with the support of the coalition.\xc2\xa0 That\'s included efforts around the Mosul Dam and Rabia, and Mount Sinjar, which we talked about quite a bit; even places like Hasakah and Kisik Junction, that have gotten somewhat less attention in the media but have important strategic objectives associated with them.\xc2\xa0 Kisik Junction, in particular, is a key supply route for ISIL to Mosul. So cutting off that junction was a successful effort by Iraqi security forces, and it was something that they undertook with the support of coalition military airpower.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication that this strategy of asking these local ground forces to take responsibility for the security situation in their own country has ultimately made important progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Prime Minister Netanyahu, I know lots has been made about the politization in the speech he\xe2\x80\x99s giving, but to what extent, if any, do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful for the Prime Minister to take such a hard line, like skeptical line against the negotiations in terms of leverage at the bargaining table?\xc2\xa0 In other words, Iran is saying, well, this guy is going to demand a better deal.\xc2\xa0 Does that help the negotiation in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I mentioned I think in response to Nadia\xe2\x80\x99s question, I don\'t think that these comments will have much of an impact on this ultimate outcome.\xc2\xa0 The President has made very clear what this negotiated agreement must result in, and that is shutting down these four pathways to a nuclear weapon for Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that is the baseline, and that is something that Iran will have to make a decision about whether or not they\'re willing to agree to.</p>\n<p>And again, the way that we will successfully complete these negotiations is not just by satisfying those concerns, but also putting in place a strict regime to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, do you know if the President is following the news of the shooting in LA of the homeless man, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s any reaction so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No reaction that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of at this point.\xc2\xa0 I know that this is something that obviously local authorities are devoting significant time to investigating.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he following the story, do you know ?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, it sounds like one of the things Senator McCain was suggesting in his comments was that the heads of Arab states are warning him and others privately -- he may be wrong; we weren\xe2\x80\x99t in on those conversations -- but are warning him that they may develop their own nuclear weapons if they don\'t like this nuclear deal that\'s emerging with Iran.\xc2\xa0 In your answers to Tommy were you suggesting the White House is okay with a potential nuclear arms race in the Mideast?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, Ed.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that one of our objectives here is to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the concerns that we have about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, that if they were to acquire a nuclear weapon, it would likely set off a nuclear arms race in one of the most volatile regions of the world.\xc2\xa0 So that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for the world.\xc2\xa0 It certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for our closest ally in the region.\xc2\xa0 But most importantly, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good for the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so given that and what you said earlier about how you think a nuclear deal with Iran would bring in inspectors and would be very tough on Iran, why did the head of the IAEA today come out and say that Iran is being very slow in their cooperation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, the fact is there were a lot of skeptics at the beginning of this effort when we put in place the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall this is essentially the interim agreement that went into effect a little over a year ago. And in the context of this interim agreement, the international community was able to roll back Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, that we have in a verifiable way confirmed that they eliminated their stockpile of highly enriched uranium.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that one point, you\'re saying, we verified that, right?\xc2\xa0 The head of the IAEA today said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is for peaceful activities.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That flies in the fact of what you just said?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, what we have confirmed is that Iran has lived up to their agreement as a part of the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 And that is confirmed based on the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 You confirmed that on your own?\xc2\xa0 Because this is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s -- this is the U.N. nuclear watchdog saying they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to verify that.\xc2\xa0 So can you explain how has the U.S. verified that without the U.N.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In the context of the Joint Plan of Action, our international inspectors have gotten very important access to Iran.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essentially unprecedented access.\xc2\xa0 And we have been able to confirm that they have complied with the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- this is critically important because you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that before the Joint Plan of Action was signed, even Prime Minister Netanyahu himself came out and said that it would be an historic mistake.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is we\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in rolling back Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program in the context of this agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in maintaining international pressure on Iran sufficient to compel them to come to the negotiating table and actually engage in serious negotiations with the international community to resolve once and for all the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 That is clearly in the best interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interests of Israel.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we would encourage people to not criticize these agreements before they\'re even signed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so to be clear, those were U.S. inspectors you\'re saying who got in?\xc2\xa0 Because the U.N. says they haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten in.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that the international community has verified that Iran lived up to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But who, though?\xc2\xa0 What agency?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Through the -- the international community has verified that Iran has lived up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Joint Plan of Action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand.\xc2\xa0 How do you define international community when the head of the U.N. watchdog said today we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten in?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those specific comments.\xc2\xa0 But we can get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, he\xe2\x80\x99s on camera saying that.\xc2\xa0 Okay, last thing.\xc2\xa0 I know there were reports over the weekend, the White House has dismissed it as rumors, that the President privately threatened the Israelis that if Israeli warplanes go in to try to attack Iran and try to eliminate their nuclear program, that the U.S. would somehow shoot down those warplanes.\xc2\xa0 I know you say that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 But the President has not taken the military option off the table with Iran.\xc2\xa0 He traditionally does not with any country.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That you have to leave this option on the table.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Israel have the military option on the table?\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. believe is it right and proper for Israel to have the military option on the table to take out Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, as I mentioned a couple of times in the context of this briefing, the Prime Minister of Israel is responsible for the national security of Israel.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly would be a judgment for him to make about whether or not Iran -- whether or not Israel should use their military capability --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United States would not interfere with that?\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying it would be a decision by the Israeli Prime Minister and the U.S. would not interfere if Israel decided that they wanted to use military --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately decisions about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s national security should be made by the Israeli Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 However, as the United States does when we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing our national security interests, we consult closely with our allies, and we would expect our allies to do the same.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the plane ride here for Benjamin Netanyahu, some reporters have said that aides said he has certain details of the talks with Iran, and that in fact he will use that information to share his concerns with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And today, in Geneva, Secretary Kerry said the U.S. is concerned by those reports that selected details of the negotiations over those talks could be somehow revealed.\xc2\xa0 Was that a warning to Benjamin Netanyahu?\xc2\xa0 And how concerned is the administration about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, on a couple of occasions I\xe2\x80\x99ve said from here that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been concerned by the way that some officials in the Israeli government -- obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re unnamed officials in the Israeli government, at least that\xe2\x80\x99s how they appear in these media reports -- the way that they have used information that\xe2\x80\x99s been shared by the United States or other sources to try to cherry-pick some facts about those negotiations in a way that radically distorts the negotiating position of the United States and our international partners.\xc2\xa0 That is counterproductive and certainly something that we are not appreciative of, to put it mildly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say, that those reports come just a week or two -- I\'m talking about the recent comments of the Israeli official on the plane -- come just a week or two after Israeli officials were also complaining in the media that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t being kept in the loop about the status of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So that may raise some questions about the credibility of these sources.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is, as I said at the time, that the United States has been providing our Israeli allies regular, detailed, classified briefings to give them the proper context about the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re making in the context of these conversations. The release of that information would betray the trust between our allies and it certainly is inconsistent with the behavior of trusted allies.\xc2\xa0 And that would be true even if these sources were to claim that they had obtained the information from somewhere else.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given your comments and Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s comments earlier today, that concern extends to the speech tomorrow by Benjamin Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what is true in any context is that the release of this information that was provided to Israel, our allies, in the context of regular, detailed, classified briefings, that releasing that information would betray the trust that exists between two allies.\xc2\xa0 And that would be -- again, that would be true even if the Israelis were to claim that they had obtained that information from somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President watch the speech tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I doubt that he will spend his whole time watching the speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you a couple quick things about the killing of Boris Nemtsov.\xc2\xa0 The French Foreign Minister today called for an investigation.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think -- does the administration believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s any hope for a thorough investigation in this case?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, let me just say that the United States condemns the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov.\xc2\xa0 And we call upon the Russian government to conduct a prompt, impartial, and transparent investigation into the circumstances of his murder and ensure that those who were responsible for this vicious killing are brought to justice.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nemtsov was a tireless advocate for his country, an opponent of corruption, and an advocate for human rights and greater transparency.\xc2\xa0 We offer our sincere condolences to Mr. Nemtsov\xe2\x80\x99s family, and to the Russian people who have lost one of the most dedicated and eloquent defenders of their rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say \xe2\x80\x9cprompt, impartial.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure if I remember the third word --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Transparent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Transparent investigation.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe there is any hope for that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some possibility of that based on?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to figure out why you think that might be possible?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, given the stature that Mr. Nemtsov had attained, primarily because of his advocacy for the rights of the Russian people, that if ever there were a situation in which a prompt, impartial, and transparent investigation were warranted, this is certainly it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gary Kasparov said yesterday -- obviously a former world chess champion, but also now a human rights advocate who lives in the United States, was asked if he would be going to the funeral of his friend and he said \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t buy one-way tickets.\xe2\x80\x9d And he talked about the chilling effect and the gloomy outlook for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s political opposition.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to those comments and what you think it means for anyone who in any way defies Vladimir Putin?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the public demonstration that we saw on the streets of Moscow yesterday I think was a pretty powerful statement about the commitment of the Russian people to speak out and stand up for their rights.\xc2\xa0 And, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s something for them to do, but that was a pretty powerful statement that they made that is probably more powerful than anything I can say from here on this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it\'s not prompt and partial and transparent -- the investigation -- then what?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned to Chris, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 But obviously --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\'m driving at is would this, and a determination made about that, be folded into consideration here and possibly in Europe about more sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Would you tie this together with Ukraine?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the simple answer to that question is that we have raised in a number of situations our concerns about the condition of human rights in Russia, and this is, sadly, only the latest chapter in a pretty long story.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s being viewed, as the demonstrations yesterday indicated, a singular event, and possibly a watershed moment in what is happening and what may in the future happen in Russia when it comes to everything that falls under the umbrella of human rights.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious if this case by itself warrants inclusion and a conversation about extra sanctions against Russia if it is not resolved to the United States government\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not prepared to say that from here, at least right now.\xc2\xa0 But what we certainly are going to be focused on is making very clear our view that this brutal murder merits a prompt, impartial and transparent investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned a few moments ago that what happened Friday on DHS is an example of failed House leadership.\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting there needs to be a new Speaker?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of members of the House of Representatives to decide who should be the leader of the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a decision that I anticipate that the President or anybody else is going to weigh in on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why use that particular language to describe what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because there was a choice for those who are leading the House of Representatives about whether or not to put on the floor a short-term extension of the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 Funding the department in that way is something that the Secretary of Homeland Security has been very critical of.\xc2\xa0 It inhibits the ability of the department to plan and make the kinds of investments that they believe are critical to our homeland security.\xc2\xa0 That was one option that was on the table.\xc2\xa0 The other option was full year funding bill that reflected bipartisan compromise about the appropriate levels of funding for that agency.\xc2\xa0 And the Republican leadership made the wrong choice about which bill to put on the floor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But if you, on the one hand, hold up Republicans to the constitutional obligation and privilege of funding the government, but on the other hand, criticize them when it does that -- I mean, it is their prerogative to fund the government in whatever way they choose, though it may fall in disfavor with this White House.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s -- I guess what I\'m getting at is, their sort of going through this very public process of trying to sort this out -- calling it failed leadership doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give them much space to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But this is not a tough one, Major.\xc2\xa0 All the hard work has been done on this.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, at the end of last year Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill sat down, they worked with the administration to determine what are the appropriate levels of funding for the Department of Homeland Security and all of the responsibilities they have to execute. Whether it\'s funding the Secret Service, or cybersecurity, or protecting our ports, there are programs to go along with all of that.\xc2\xa0 And it was the responsibility of members of Congress to work in bipartisan fashion to determine the appropriate level of funding for all those programs, and they did.\xc2\xa0 They successfully completed that effort.\xc2\xa0 And there is strong bipartisan support for it on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when an initiative like that that has strong bipartisan support that\xe2\x80\x99s so critical to the homeland security of the United States of America, it does reflect failed leadership when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t put to a vote of the members of the House of Representatives, particularly when you know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass with bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>So, again, passing a seven-day extension is certainly better than allowing the Department of Homeland Security to shut down.\xc2\xa0 But when they had an opportunity to pass a full year funding bill without any extraneous, politically motivated riders, that\'s an opportunity they should have taken.\xc2\xa0 And they should have taken it last week.</p>\n<p>I guess the one silver lining in all of this is that on the Senate side they have already passed this bipartisan full year funding bill.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s put to a vote in the House this week, it will pass.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully that\'s what will happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones on Iran.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on what Ed said, I want to make sure that -- and I get whatever your assessment is of who these international community inspectors were that were not members of the IAEA, first of all.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension of the Joint Plan of Action that Iran could comply and the IAEA could say it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen everything it would like to see.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the comments of the IAEA chief, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to respond to what was just said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And Jonathan raised the question of Congress having ultimate approval over whatever deal, if one is achieved. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that baked into the cake, though?\xc2\xa0 Because you can\'t remove the sanctions without Congress approving that.\xc2\xa0 So at some point, Congress is going to have a role in rendering its verdict on this deal -- maybe not in total, but on the economic sanctions portion of it, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that is correct.\xc2\xa0 Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s what this is -- I tried to explain this in the context of answering Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question, so let me try one more time to make it a little bit more clear.\xc2\xa0 What we envision in a scenario where a deal is reached with Iran is not taking the step of relaxing a large number of sanctions that would free up substantial sums of money to go to Iran.\xc2\xa0 These are the sanctions that are affected by -- that were passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we envision is an agreement that puts in place a series of steps where Iran takes some steps to demonstrate their compliance with the agreement, and a little bit of sanctions relief is offered, and that that is the process that continues until we can have a lot of confidence in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to live up to their end of the bargain.\xc2\xa0 And once they do, then we will ultimately get to a place where we want to start to make changes to the statutory sanctions regime that was passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, yes, removing those sanctions, as passed by Congress, would require an act of Congress and I do think could plausibly be interpreted as Congress signing off on the deal.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of how you interpret it, the fact of the matter is Congress has been an important player in this effort from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 They put in place the sanctions regime that compelled Iran to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 The administration has, throughout these negotiations, kept members of Congress in both parties informed of exactly the status of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why as we move forward in this process -- ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s closer to the end than the beginning -- that we\'re going to need Congress to weigh in on this.\xc2\xa0 And again, the reason for that is that the administration does not envision a scenario where substantial sanctions relief is offered right away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Substantial U.S. sanctions relief?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It could be sanctions relief from the other participants in the negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, all of this is part of a coordinated effort with the broader international community.\xc2\xa0 And so I wouldn\'t speculate about how this will be staged other than to say that the United States is going to expect Iran to demonstrate over a period of time compliance with this agreement before offering substantial sanctions relief, particularly on the scale of the significant sanctions that Congress passed and put in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A bit of a perceptive and historical question.\xc2\xa0 Iran has been suffering under sanctions from the West since Jimmy Carter\xe2\x80\x99s administration, when the hostages were taken.\xc2\xa0 What makes you feel -- or does the administration know that these sanctions really -- all of these sanctions, including right now\xc2\xa0 -- are having any real effect on Iran and their disposition towards a nuclear exploration, say?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things about that, JC.\xc2\xa0 The first I would say is that many economic analysts have observed that the Iranian economy has taken a substantial hit since the sanctions regime was put in place.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s everything from the value of their currency to the economic growth projections for the future.\xc2\xa0 All those things took a negative hit once this sanctions regime was put in place, and those who understand these details a lot better than I do have characterized this sanctions regime as one of the most stringent sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s been put in place against any country in history.</p>\n<p>So what we also know is that Iran has decided to engage in a set of serious negotiations, that previously Iran had just used diplomatic negotiations as cover to try to make progress on their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 But in the context of these talks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually succeeded in not just halting Iran\xe2\x80\x99s progress as it relates to their nuclear program but actually rolling it back in several key areas, including reducing and eliminating their stockpile of highly enriched uranium.</p>\n<p>So I think the evidence indicates that this sanctions regime has been effective.</p>\n<p>Fred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Last week I asked if there might be some type of informal meeting on the side with the two administration representatives.\xc2\xa0 You said you weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure that they\xe2\x80\x99d be there on the same day as the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 They are today.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if there will be -- and if not, why not?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what would be the harm in some sort of meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things on this, Fred.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Prime Minister spoke shortly after Ambassador Power completed her remarks.\xc2\xa0 But I know that they did not have a meeting on the sidelines there.\xc2\xa0 Some of that I think is related to the fact that the Prime Minister was scheduled to speak shortly after she completed her remarks.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t time for a meeting.</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99ll also point out that the administration has, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed quite a bit over the last several weeks, gone to great lengths to make sure that the administration was not perceived as interfering in an upcoming Israeli election.\xc2\xa0 So, as you know, Prime Minister Netanyahu is on the ballot in just a couple of weeks, and the President and other senior members of the administration are not meeting with him on this trip to the U.S. because we want to avoid even the appearance of interfering in a democratic election in another country, in this case, Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a separate issue, last week there were reports about the ATF is looking at banning a certain type of ammo for automatic weapons.\xc2\xa0 The administration had advocated some type of ban or restriction on automatic weapons in 2013 that didn\xe2\x80\x99t go through Congress.\xc2\xa0 Is this sort of an executive -- a way of doing executively what Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do previously?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Fred, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Congress has considered this specific provision.\xc2\xa0 The President has long believed that there are some common-sense steps that we can take to -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the federal government, including Congress -- that we can take to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans while also taking some common-sense steps to prevent people who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have guns from getting them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in this case, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an ATF proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s being considered through its standard process and it\xe2\x80\x99s open now for public comment.\xc2\xa0 For specific questions about that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the ATF.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it would be fair to say, as I mentioned, that we are looking at additional ways to protect our brave men and women in law enforcement and believe that this process is valuable for that reason alone.\xc2\xa0 This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons, that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99d put this in the category of common-sense steps that the government can take to protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans while also making sure that our law enforcement officers who are walking the beat every day can do their jobs just a little bit more safely.</p>\n<p>Cheryl, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 A number of groups today sent a letter to the White House, a new letter but it\xe2\x80\x99s an old issue, asking the President to issue an executive order that would require government or federal contractors to disclose political contributions.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be open to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is an issue that we have talked about at some length, as you know.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news to make on this particular issue, but I know that there are a number of advocates out there who do believe that this is one way that we could try to introduce some greater transparency into our political system, particularly when it comes to political campaign contributions.</p>\n<p>But at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news on that.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good Monday.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:55 P.M.
