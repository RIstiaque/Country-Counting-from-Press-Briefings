GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been hours. \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Before we get started, let me just confirm for you all what a number of you are reporting and some of you are seeing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President will not sign H.R. 3808. \xc2\xa0Our concern is unintended -- the unintended consequences on consumer protections, particularly in light of the home foreclosure issue and developments with mortgage processors. \xc2\xa0So the President is exercising a pocket veto, sending that legislation back to Congress to iron out some of those unintended consequences.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You can do that even though the pro forma session is going on in the Senate?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding, yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what bill is that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0H.R. 3808.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it by number. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it by title. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re at an impasse.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Interstate recognition of notarization --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the foreclosure --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the IRON Act. \xc2\xa0It has to do with notarizations -- out-of-state notarizations for financial documents.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mr. Feller.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I had a question about two other topics, Robert. \xc2\xa0First of all, on domestic politics, I wanted to ask you about something the President said last night: \xc2\xa0Unless we\xe2\x80\x99re able to maintain Democrats in the House and Senate, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be stalled for two years or four years, and we could even go backwards. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about what he sees as obstructionism. \xc2\xa0But to say that this election is going to be stalling the next two years if Republicans win, is he just basically giving up there? \xc2\xa0I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s two more years of his presidency, even with a Republican Congress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, and, look, I think we have seen Republicans for the previous two years stop and say no to virtually everything that the President has proposed. \xc2\xa0I think obviously the concern -- the concern he expresses there is if they were to gain control of some branch of the -- some house of the legislative branch that they would continue doing the same thing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many people who voted for the President who would expect him to continue to advance his agenda and work towards it even with a Republican Congress. \xc2\xa0Is he going to try to do that or is he just --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Ben, we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to do that since the day we got here.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, there have been -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a strategy on behalf of -- exercised by Senator McConnell and Congressman Boehner to say no and to try to stop each and every thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happened. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why they want to roll back Wall Street reform. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why they want to go back to the rules of -- that had banks in charge of making some of the decisions that got us into this mess. \xc2\xa0Those are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back to.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, there have been instances in the past where a President has lost seats or lost a house in the midterms, and then adjusted and got things done. \xc2\xa0Do you think the President is hopeful that he can do that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think the President is working hard every day not to lose a house.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what about on the Mideast peace process? \xc2\xa0Can you update us specifically about whether the President is having a role here trying to keep these talks going?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I know that the President met earlier in the week with Secretary of State Clinton to get an update on where we are in the situation. \xc2\xa0I know that both the Secretary of State and former Senator Mitchell, our Middle East envoy, have worked throughout the week with both sides to try to continue these important direct talks.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new or specific on that. \xc2\xa0Again, as Senator Mitchell said I think over the weekend, we continue to work back and forth with both sides in order to move this process along.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, on that bill that would make it harder for homeowners to challenge foreclosures, why not just a straight veto of that? \xc2\xa0Why do a pocket veto? \xc2\xa0And also, were you guys blindsided by this? \xc2\xa0I know you said you had meetings on this today. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from -- let me check on the second one with counsel. \xc2\xa0On the first one, Caren, I would say we have heard from officials around the country about the concern that they have about the possible unintended consequences of this legislation, certainly in light of what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the mortgage processing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So out of an abundance of caution and to ensure that those unintended effects don\xe2\x80\x99t harm consumers, the President will send the bill back, and believes that Congress did not intend for those unintended consequences to be in the legislation, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- and we will as an administration work with Congress to fix this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you talk with people on the Hill and you think maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll send it back in another form? \xc2\xa0Is that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on that. \xc2\xa0I know they were certainly informing the Hill of the President\xe2\x80\x99s action and certainly we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with the Hill in whatever capacity we need to to fix any legislation so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t complicate the process.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then also I had another question. \xc2\xa0Just following up on the discussion about Pakistan, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how extensively is this going to be dealt with in the December report? \xc2\xa0And can you talk a little bit about what we can expect in the December AfPak report? \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting saying that this is not going to be a decisive report, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be as extensive a review as last year. \xc2\xa0What is it going to be? \xc2\xa0What can the American people expect?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, well, remember, last year we were making some very broad and fundamental decisions about the direction of our policies, some resource decisions that needed to be made. \xc2\xa0I do not expect that the -- that process will be as extensive as the process that we went through last fall and early last winter. \xc2\xa0Obviously the President wants to evaluate, as we do each month, where we are; decide whether or not there are any adjustments or changes to make. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that we got an increase in our force structure; the troop resources got into Afghanistan, as we promised, by the end of August.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So this will give us a chance to evaluate several months of a full complement of those resources in the country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say whether -- what we expect ultimately out of the review. \xc2\xa0I think obviously the President wants to take stock of where we are and see if there are any minor adjustments. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect any major adjustments.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what about Pakistan? \xc2\xa0Is the review an important chance to have a look at where things stand, especially with everything that\xe2\x80\x99s going on now?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We have a very difficult and complicated situation in Pakistan. \xc2\xa0We have worked hard on this relationship. \xc2\xa0We understand it\xe2\x80\x99s important to our security. \xc2\xa0Later this month representatives of the government of Pakistan will be here to continue the strategic dialogue that the President began at the beginning of his administration in order to have very regular conversations about what is in our mutual interest, particularly fighting insurgents and extremists that we know threaten Pakistan, threaten the stability of Afghanistan, and ultimately threaten the security of our homeland.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who will be in that delegation? \xc2\xa0And is the President himself going to be in there?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a longer list of who that is.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President called, or does the President intend to call, Roy Halladay? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could we talk to him, too?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You could -- you wire that through David Plouffe, he\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to be on the phone, too. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has. \xc2\xa0I can check on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you could let me know, that would be great. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) And the other question -- I went back and I read the August 4th --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I was waiting for like Zardari or somebody -- Netanyahu -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First things first, right?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I went back and I read the August 4th briefing with Allen, Lubchenco, you and Carol Browner, after Carol Browner went on the morning shows and gave what you acknowledge to be, and the oil spill commission says is erroneous information about -- when she said that 70 percent, three-quarters of the oil was gone. \xc2\xa0And that was overstating the case. \xc2\xa0And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really see any -- while it\xe2\x80\x99s true, absolutely, that Lubchenco gave the precise information, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really see any correction that -- or any alerting of the public that however many tens of millions of Americans had been given incorrect information a few hours before. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I brought the report out, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring my briefing out. \xc2\xa0Let me go back and look. \xc2\xa0I would point you, I guess, to what Director -- Dr. Lubchenco said in that briefing as she appropriately represented the viewpoint of NOAA.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Look, I think it is important to understand that our response attacked the oil spill in an unprecedented way. \xc2\xa0It was the largest environmental disaster that we have ever faced and we attacked it with the largest federal response. \xc2\xa0We did all that was humanly possible in the most challenging of environments.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but this is more about communication, about communicating an overly optimistic -- whether it was a misunderstanding or not, an overly optimistic prognosis of what was going on in the water. \xc2\xa0And the White House has acknowledged that Carol Browner misunderstood, misspoke, what have you. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if not only does the White House regret that she did that, but that the White House didn\xe2\x80\x99t make more of a point, because there were headlines the next day -- 75 percent of the oil gone -- to make it clear that she had misspoke.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Jake, I think we were -- I will go back and read it. \xc2\xa0I think we were abundantly clear in the briefing that was done in here on the 4th of August exactly what the oil budget represented. \xc2\xa0It represented the fact that there was very good news, that oil had biodegraded, that oil had been skimmed, that oil had been burned, that the very worst-case scenarios that many people thought we would be dealing with never came to fruition, largely because of that federal response.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look through the briefing. \xc2\xa0Look, I think it is fair to say that Carol probably did hundreds of hours of interviews and may have misspoke once, which is a pretty darn good track record and one that we made sure was accurate certainly just a few hours later.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But should you have been more precise? Carol Browner gave information that was not -- I forget the word that Jonathan used earlier, but not as nuanced as it should have been?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I would point you to the briefing. \xc2\xa0I think the briefing on the 4th was rather clear.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who in OMB decided to withhold the information on the worst-case scenario on the oil spill? \xc2\xa0And did somebody in the White House know about this?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, no information was altered. \xc2\xa0No information was withheld. \xc2\xa0And nothing in the report had anything to do with the robust response.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The report that NOAA sent over did not include in its modeling -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a flow-rate document -- in its modeling did not include any activity that was being done, as I just mentioned a minute ago, to mechanically recover, skim, to burn, to disperse, to boom oil from spreading along the coast and up the Eastern seaboard, which we now know it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0OMB is a regular part of a process that reviews government documents before they\xe2\x80\x99re released. \xc2\xa0NOAA, as we put out in a statement yesterday, understood that the analysis did not include that, went back and included that, and that report was released and is on the Internet for anyone to read today.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But did they know about the initial worst-case scenario before they released that information?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Did who know?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did NOAA or OMB know about the initial worst-case --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, the worst-case scenario was being discussed on national television -- in fact, on CNN, at that very time that our worst-case scenario was 100,000 barrels of oil leaking a day. \xc2\xa0We know that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happening. \xc2\xa0We know that the response was robust in ensuring that every step possible was taken to protect the coastline and prevent more damage from being done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that on page 10, when the report says staff was told that the Office of Management and Budget denied NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s request, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that is simply false?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, if you read the other two paragraphs -- I guess I have in front of me -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion about whether or not this is a flow-rate document. \xc2\xa0This is not a flow-rate document. \xc2\xa0This is basically a document that goes through the likelihood of shoreline impacts, and assesses a series of 500 models for where that oil may or may not go.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The report did not include any efforts that were being done or would be done over the course of -- I think the modeling went 120 days -- that none of the modeling took into account that things were being done to prevent the oil from spreading from the wellhead. \xc2\xa0So therefore it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an accurate representation of what the larger environment would have looked like.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, but -- so OMB did deny a request from NOAA, just not that request?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0OMB sent the report back to NOAA to include that in the 500 different modeling analysis that were done on shoreline impact. \xc2\xa0That report is on the Internet now for people to look at. \xc2\xa0The worst-case scenario -- and if you look at those maps, the worst-case scenario was oil off the coast of what looks like probably the Hilton Head/Charleston area in South Carolina, which is, as you know, several hundred miles, maybe a thousand or so miles from where the oil actually did get to because the response prevented it from spreading.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On health care, on the health care waivers, the 30 or so health care waivers that have been granted to McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s and some other businesses and health insurers, where\xe2\x80\x99s the stop? \xc2\xa0I mean, if you give them to some, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you have to give them to anybody who asks? \xc2\xa0And if there are a lot more waivers, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that undermine health care reform?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, health care reform passed and is being implemented. \xc2\xa0And the waivers are about ensuring and protecting the coverage that people have until there are better options available to them in 2014.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0These are only one-year waivers. \xc2\xa0Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they going to ask for them year after year?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, our job is to protect -- a lot of these plans are called mini-med plans. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re very -- they\xe2\x80\x99re basic coverage below a number of what I think most people would consider kind of minimal standards.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We want to ensure that in the time that it takes to implement the law and to give people better options, that they don\xe2\x80\x99t find themselves at the mercy of an insurance company jacking up their rates. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why those waivers were granted.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But now that the dam has kind of broken, why would anybody not ask for a waiver? \xc2\xa0Anybody who feels that this law burdens them in any way is going to ask for a waiver.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case because that\xe2\x80\x99s not been the case thus far.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, is that -- maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s because it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been known that widely that 30 have been granted. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not worried that the dam is going to burst here?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried that the dam is going to burst. \xc2\xa0Health insurance reform is going to provide far greater opportunity and far better coverage to millions of Americans to ensure that they get the right health care and the right care.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And quickly, a new CBS poll shows the President at 38 percent on approval of handling of the economy -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the lowest yet. \xc2\xa0And only 15 percent say they\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to vote for a candidate supported by President Obama; 31 percent say less likely. \xc2\xa0Any comment?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Not really. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Look, I think the -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of money to find out that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a very tough economy. \xc2\xa0We are in the midst of, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in here, dealing with 8 million jobs that have been lost, a financial calamity, a mortgage crisis that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time to dig out of.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, with everything the President is doing and saying and talking about signs of the -- glimmers of the recovery, why would it be getting worse, not better?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not getting better fast enough -- which is understandable and the President is as frustrated as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the 605 or so respondents to that poll.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mike.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s over a thousand.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Is it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Maybe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t include the other 295. \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0Go ahead.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President find the 30 waivers or so on health care troubling, perhaps a flaw in the law if you need to offer that many waivers?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, again, this is about implementing a bill correctly. \xc2\xa0This is about ensuring that people have -- as health care reform ramps up, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we protect consumers and we don\xe2\x80\x99t put them at the mercy of health insurance companies.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One of the waivers went to the United Federation of Teachers in New York. \xc2\xa0What about the criticism that this may be returning a favor to a supporter?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard that. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anybody make that. \xc2\xa0Given the questions that were asked about our so-called relationship with business, I think that would be a charge that would be hard even for most to make.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Savannah.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You guys have been pushing back pretty hard on the findings in this report, and I guess I just wonder, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the whole point of this presidential commission to learn from mistakes? \xc2\xa0And you guys are pushing back insofar as the conclusions are damaging to you.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, these are staff working drafts. \xc2\xa0They stipulate on them these don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily -- are not necessarily the opinions of those on the commission.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President appointed a commission to ask some very tough questions. \xc2\xa0But I also think, Savannah, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help anybody in understanding the oil crisis if what\xe2\x80\x99s set out in the report doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually match with what happened in reality.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, you guys are fighting the conclusions pretty hard. \xc2\xa0I take your point that it\xe2\x80\x99s a draft, but, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President himself that said he told Graham and Reilly don\xe2\x80\x99t wait, tell me now. \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold the results of your review for six months and then tell me; tell me when you find out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Savannah, as you reported last night, the report says clearly \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not necessarily reflect the views either of the commission as a whole or of any of its members.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0But again, Savannah, I think -- the President wants -- the President appointed the commission and looks forward to the commission\xe2\x80\x99s final conclusions. \xc2\xa0But understand, Savannah, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anybody any good to look into a situation and not have the full story. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- if -- the document that NOAA sent to OMB is not a flow-rate document. \xc2\xa0It has -- there is nothing in it that talks about worst case, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in it that computes a flow rate.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, if you read the upper part of page 10, you\xe2\x80\x99d come away with that feeling. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why Dr. Lubchenco will send a letter today to the commission ensuring that they have an adequate understanding of what was happening in that process at that time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, given that, on the flipside, are you then concerned about the analysis that\xe2\x80\x99s going on, on a staff level? \xc2\xa0I mean, why would you have any confidence in the findings if -- it\xe2\x80\x99s garbage in, garbage out -- if you think this report is so flawed?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, what we have answered questions on -- yes, do we have concerns about the breadth of that analysis and the fact that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken into account or lead people to conclude different things that we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe shows the full context? \xc2\xa0Absolutely.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any point of criticism in these staff reports that you guys would accept and say, you know what, we could have done that better?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, no, no, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody in this building or anybody that was involved in this that would tell you that everything was done perfectly. \xc2\xa0Everybody --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anything specific --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go through my copy of it. \xc2\xa0I would say this. \xc2\xa0Savannah, we were dealing with an unprecedented situation. \xc2\xa0You heard Admiral Allen, in the very first days, discuss 40 years of dealing with disasters and never dealing with a disaster that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t either see or walk right up to. \xc2\xa0This was 5,000 feet below the ocean, the greatest environmental disaster that our country has faced, met with the greatest federal response.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that as the commissioners get the staff drafts, that they include what was actually and wholly taking place, not simply an analysis based on only part of that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, and then last thing on the notarization bill. \xc2\xa0Is this an example of incompetence by Congress that they passed a bill that was about to lay on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, not really recognizing the full consequences?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, this was -- I think that, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in a statement that we put out -- we believe that certainly people had best intentions in mind, but because of a confluence of events we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing particularly around the processing of mortgages, we thought it was important to ensure that none of those unintended consequences affecting consumers came into play.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mark.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, when OMB intervenes in a report, to what extent do politics play a role?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, this was career OMB staffers dealing with career NOAA scientists. \xc2\xa0Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand none of the science in any of the report was changed. \xc2\xa0Nothing in the report dealt with or impacted at all the response that you are seeing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, the report didn\xe2\x80\x99t accurately convey what would have gone on in the modeling over a 120-day period about the possible shoreline impacts geographically of that oil.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on another issue, are you aware of the problem that kept some diplomats from getting to the reception on Tuesday afternoon?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0As I understand it, there was information that was inputted into the WAVES records incorrectly that prevented some. \xc2\xa0I believe -- we certainly apologize for that inconvenience. \xc2\xa0I believe the State Department has also made phone calls about that, expressing our regret on any of that error.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On -- briefly referenced it -- but has the President called Zardari on Pakistan?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no. \xc2\xa0The President has not spoken to him recently.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s being done to -- I mean, is there anything beyond a Patterson apology? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s being done to mend fences or unwind tension there? \xc2\xa0I mean, you have these fuel convoys aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting in.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, obviously you saw the statement from Ambassador Patterson, which I think in many ways speaks for itself. \xc2\xa0Obviously she is very much in contact with the Pakistani government as are other officials at the State Department. \xc2\xa0And I would say, Hans -- I said this earlier -- we expect that the government of Pakistan will do what is necessary to ensure the safety of those involved from militants and insurgents. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s their responsibility, too.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But aside from the embassy in Pakistan, nothing is being done here at the White House?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there is anybody else at NSC that\xe2\x80\x99s in touch with them. \xc2\xa0I do not know that anybody -- certainly the President has not talked to President Zardari.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just to shift gears real quick, earlier today, Donohue over at the Chamber of Commerce accused this administration of \xe2\x80\x9csuffocating the entrepreneurial spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Can we get your comment?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think he did that in unleashing a series of new ads. \xc2\xa0And I would reiterate what I have said and what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President say later today about third-party ads. \xc2\xa0If every one of the donors that have gone into contributing for those ads, the identities of those individuals or groups should be known. \xc2\xa0Certainly Mr. Donohue wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I assume -- have any problem with listing those -- listing any donors that might have contributed to such an ad campaign.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So your concern is the process, not the actual substance of what Donohue is saying?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, the scientific guidelines. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re working on that through HHS, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to find out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And can you just go over -- you talked a little bit this morning about the role that OMB plays as kind of a traffic cop --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0They are part of a regular process of reviewing agency reports, of speeches, testimony, releases, policy decisions, to ensure that the material is accurate and reflective of reality. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the role that they played in this instance as well.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not sort of a graveyard for scientific reports?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, because, again, no scientific data was changed in this. \xc2\xa0Again, the --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying specifically about the oil --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Right, no, but I want to say, in general, it\xe2\x80\x99s not true, and in this specific instance, none of the scientific data was changed whatsoever -- the entire situation that was taken into account in the modeling of potential shoreline impact.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Scott.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert. \xc2\xa0Could you shed some light on what\xe2\x80\x99s been some confusion around whether or not the United States has offered Israel any guarantees, any incentives to keep this --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Scott, all I will say on that is what I said earlier about our process in terms of the Secretary of State and Ambassador Mitchell working with both sides to bring them closer to a comprehensive peace and to a continuation of direct talks, without getting into diplomatic specifics.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s message to the Arab League tomorrow on whether or not to continue?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, that is -- in many ways, that\xe2\x80\x99s what is going on right now. \xc2\xa0That is what former Senator Mitchell is working through. \xc2\xa0And we believe -- we saw in their participation in Washington and ultimately in direct talks in the Middle East that there was a seriousness of purpose that we thought was productive and could lead us on a path to something that generations have been seeking. \xc2\xa0And we hope that even in the disappointment of a decision on settlement moratoriums that we can continue those direct talks and we hope to do that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, thank you. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a large group of veterans who participated in Afghanistan and Iraq and they\xe2\x80\x99re demonstrating today. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re asking that people with PTSD and traumatic brain injury not be sent back, and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that this has contributed to quite a large amount of suicides in the military. \xc2\xa0Is the President aware of this? \xc2\xa0Is he communicating with them in any way?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the protest outside. \xc2\xa0Obviously TBI -- traumatic brain injury -- PTSD is something that the President worked on as a member of the Senate. \xc2\xa0Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen have been working with veterans, veteran service organizations, along with General Shinseki, around the alarming and high rate of suicides both in theater and back here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that we can and should take extraordinarily seriously.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We know that combat in both of those theaters puts an enormous strain on individuals, and both those in combat and those coming back ought to have access to every benefit that they deserve and that they\xe2\x80\x99ve earned. \xc2\xa0We, through the Recovery Act, increased the funding for the VA to historic levels and we will continue to ensure that those that serve have access to the best services.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If a soldier says he or she does not feel fit to go back into combat, back into the battlefield, is there any sympathy for that soldier?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, again, what I just said -- obviously that concern can and will be taken seriously. \xc2\xa0I would point you specifically to DOD about the operational procedure for how that might happen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0The Washington Post reports that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administration is trying to escalate the international trade war on China\xe2\x80\x99s currency. \xc2\xa0Is that true?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you have heard the Secretary of Treasury and the President and others in the administration discuss the need for China to take steps as it relates to its currency, that we are watching and evaluating the measures and the steps that they take. \xc2\xa0We understand Congress -- before leaving, the House passed legislation relating to that, and expressed the same concern that the President and the Secretary of Treasury have. \xc2\xa0We continue to believe that China must take steps.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that legislation is helpful?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the evaluation of the legislation. \xc2\xa0I think the legislation demonstrates that there is a bipartisan recognition -- a recognition at both end of Pennsylvania Avenue -- the concern that we have for China\xe2\x80\x99s currency.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would the President sign such legislation?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That would be part of the evaluation process, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So will the President discuss the issue with Secretary Geithner this afternoon for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s IMF --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have no doubt that when the President and Secretary Geithner get together, that will always be a topic of conversation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on the working documents of the national commission, now that you\xe2\x80\x99re at a briefing where we can record your answers for use, one of the fundamental -- well, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t record you earlier.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, you can make copious and accurate notes and reflect them in -- go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One of the fundamental points that the working documents make is that the optimistic expression of information from the administration showed the government was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid. \xc2\xa0Was it either of those?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0This was an unprecedented environmental disaster met with an unprecedented federal response, which prevented any of the worst-case scenarios to coming to fruition. \xc2\xa0It prevented the spread of oil along the East Coast. \xc2\xa0We took --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Were you always candid about the information the government had?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0When we had information, we gave it to the public. \xc2\xa0That was -- that has always been our charge. \xc2\xa0We were -- throughout this process, we got better information. \xc2\xa0When the rig exploded and the blowout preventer failed 5,000 feet below the ocean, nobody could see what was happening. \xc2\xa0Through the course of several months, we got better information. \xc2\xa0We got cameras 5,000 feet below the surface. \xc2\xa0We enhanced the video that we saw. \xc2\xa0We were able to do more three-dimensional modeling. \xc2\xa0And then we directed, at Secretary Chu\xe2\x80\x99s insistence, British Petroleum to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just BP.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Just BP -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a habit -- to install pressure monitors at the site to get the best available data on the flow rate. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we did. \xc2\xa0We always sought to provide the best information as we were engaged in the most robust federal response that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen to an accident of this magnitude ever.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on Ann, and then another question --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, back on?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on what Ann was saying, and then another question, but the AP article says that this White House did block scientists. \xc2\xa0So are you saying unequivocally that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. \xc2\xa0That is -- again, the report, after it included what was -- what was included -- what NOAA had specifically not included in its modeling, that report was released and is on the Internet today.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, on a couple of other things. \xc2\xa0One, the President goes to Bowie today to talk about education and to help the O\xe2\x80\x99Malley-Brown ticket, but in the long run, the President talks about education helping the economy. \xc2\xa0Where does it stand? \xc2\xa0How do you reconcile this on the short term with education -- his promotion for education when jobs are needed now and money needs to be moving now? \xc2\xa0How do you reconcile that on the short term with education?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Reconcile? \xc2\xa0Maybe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How is education in the next couple of months going to help the economy?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, as you saw just this week with private and public partnerships with skill training and in our lifting up of community colleges that Dr. Biden is so passionate about, just in those two aspects alone you see us partnering with educational institutions and in businesses to create training for and a skill set for the jobs of today even as we understand that education will create the foundation of preparing a workforce for the jobs not just of today, but ultimately of tomorrow. \xc2\xa0A society without a strong educational system is not a society that will long flourish economically, as without a skilled workforce, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to attract the type of jobs that are necessary. \xc2\xa0I think that is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s true in virtually every community in this country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, again, it goes back to the fact that that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat medium to long term. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I guess -- ensuring that we have the type of education that is necessary today isn\xe2\x80\x99t done -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that in -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that in place of ensuring that we have a strong and robust economic recovery. \xc2\xa0If it ever becomes either/or, we go back to the scenario I discussed a second ago, and that is you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to find a society that will flourish.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also, Elizabeth Warren delivered a presentation to the economic team of the President yesterday. \xc2\xa0Was this her first presentation to the President in her new role?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I believe it was her first attendance at the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic daily briefing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was it a formal --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You know, I have to say I am almost always in there and I was not in there yesterday. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Stephen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to the Afghan policy review, this is not expected to produce major changes to the strategy. \xc2\xa0Will the evaluations be used to start to make the decisions on how pronounced the beginning of the drawdown will be in July 2011?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Let me get some better guidance from NSC on that, Stephen. \xc2\xa0I think that -- the President, again, receives a weekly update from commanders in Afghanistan and from our diplomatic corps in both Afghanistan and in Pakistan; receives -- there\xe2\x80\x99s monthly Situation Room updates, and obviously this is part of the review to ensure that we evaluate where we are, chart the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re making, and identify places that we know we have to improve on.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I think it is likely that in each of those meetings and in each of those memos, there are some positive things that are happening and some things that we understand we have to change. \xc2\xa0That will be what\xe2\x80\x99s involved in the December review.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, we will have a better chance of and a better way of looking at where we are several months after the full complement of additional troops are into Afghanistan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Robert, and back to the Middle East, if I may. \xc2\xa0It was reported today in Israel that Prime Minister Netanyahu asked President Obama to abide by the agreement between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon in 2004. \xc2\xa0Essentially it allows for the annexation of large settlement blocks as part of a final settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0Could you be able to tell us what\xe2\x80\x99s the position today of the White House on this agreement?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have not seen that statement, so let me look at some of that reporting and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that we can do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, the President is going to Illinois today to help out in the Senate race there. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us what other Senate races are now on the schedule, the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been a priority of the President. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a priority of a number of members of Congress. \xc2\xa0And we would certainly love to see those loopholes closed and to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not rewarding companies for moving jobs overseas, absolutely.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, sir, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Robert. \xc2\xa0Just returning back to politics, the midterms here. \xc2\xa0As you know, the President has made a real push over the last few weeks to sort of reignite enthusiasm among the young voters. \xc2\xa0You had that rally in Madison, Wisconsin. \xc2\xa0On the 14th he\xe2\x80\x99s having the MTV town hall. \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about how important this demographic group is to Democrats in the midterm elections?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think we saw young people get involved in big numbers in 2008. \xc2\xa0We saw people that had never been involved in these type of political campaigns before registering the vote, exercising -- not only exercising that right but getting involved in actively participating in campaigns, which is good for our democracy.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So always in an off-year election you see a drop-off in terms of the types of participation that you normally see in a presidential year. \xc2\xa0We want to ensure that what\xe2\x80\x99s been referred to appropriately as the \xe2\x80\x9centhusiasm gap\xe2\x80\x9d is closed, and certainly a number of national polls show that that is indeed happening. \xc2\xa0And this is some place I think the President has a real affinity for young people being involved in the political process, and ensuring that what they have at stake, they have a chance to participate in in this election.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know, the judge ruled in the Ahmed Ghailani trial that one witness would not testify -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the man who allegedly sold Ghailani the explosives used in the U.S. embassy bombings. \xc2\xa0And a lot of critics of terrorists being tried -- or alleged terrorists being tried in civilian courts are seizing on this as an example of exactly why they should be prosecuted in military tribunals. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if this -- what your response is, what the President thinks of this, and whether or not this does indeed, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, underscore the need for some of these cases to go to military tribunals.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I will say, first and foremost, Jake, we were active participants in reforming a military commission system to allow that to be an important avenue in dealing with alleged terrorists. \xc2\xa0In this particular case, I believe -- and I\xe2\x80\x99d point you specifically to Justice -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a pending criminal matter that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wade deeply into because of it. \xc2\xa0I understand that they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly reviewing the order and making plans, I believe, to appeal what the judge issued yesterday. \xc2\xa0And we continue to believe that, as we saw in the case of Mr. Shahzad, that there is an appropriate avenue for these courts to play in dealing with -- and in Mr. Shahzad\xe2\x80\x99s case -- arresting, interrogating, getting valuable intelligence information and ultimately locking him up for the rest of his life for his actions in Times Square.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Kendra.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President and First Lady be hitting the campaign trail together? \xc2\xa0And what does --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR.
