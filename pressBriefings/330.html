EST</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 Before we begin, I\'m sure you all saw some significant news out of Philadelphia today.\xc2\xa0 In anticipation of your questions on that, I\'m happy to give you the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he is thrilled that the city of Philadelphia and the mayor today enacted a bill that would guarantee working families at least five paid sick days off per year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>According to the bill, approximately 200,000 Philadelphia families who currently lack access to paid leave now stand to gain from today\xe2\x80\x99s action.\xc2\xa0 As you know, about 27 days ago -- I did the math this morning -- the President called for an expansion of paid sick leave as part of his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet moved on this.\xc2\xa0 But we appreciate the city of Philadelphia doing just that.\xc2\xa0 We call on more cities and localities to do it.\xc2\xa0 We also reiterate our call for Congress to move as well.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\'m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you were thrilled.\xc2\xa0 I thought you were talking about the DNC convention.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have any thrill reaction to that as well?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We saw that announcement as well, Margaret, and we\'re very pleased with that announcement as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the cease-fire deal there in any way reduces the pressure on the President in terms of having him make a decision about sending more lethal weapons over to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 Our position on that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, which is that we are constantly evaluating our response to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 The President heretofore has been clear that the reason we haven\'t sent over the types of aid you\'re talking about is that principally we believe this should be resolved diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 And that is our preference; that is our priority.\xc2\xa0 And so we haven\'t made any determinations to change the sorts of equipment we\'re going to be sending.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that discussion about sanctions, Eric, increasing sanctions on Russia?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I have no new announcements to make at this time.\xc2\xa0 We would only consider rolling back sanctions if Russia lives up to not only the agreement that was announced a few hours ago, but also the agreement that was agreed upon in Minsk a few months ago now.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, they have not lived up to that agreement in a variety of ways, so I don\'t have anything new on that until they do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President optimistic that this agreement will hold?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think we welcome the news.\xc2\xa0 We\'re certainly gratified by the hard work of our European partners, including Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande.\xc2\xa0 We consider it a potential significant step in the right direction, provided that all parties abide by it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned, is the President concerned that by putting another cease-fire in place now, after the pro-Russian forces have gained so much territory, that you are essentially enshrining the territorial gains that they have made?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 David, I think that we welcome the agreement that was announced a few hours ago.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still studying the details of what\xe2\x80\x99s exactly in the agreement.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it is a potentially significant step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 But our bottom line on this is that actions are going to matter a whole lot more than words.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ll need Russia and all sides to live up to what they agreed upon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is your bottom line, though, that you have to go back to where things were at the time of the Minsk agreement several months ago when obviously the pro-Russian forces had much less territory?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We absolutely believe that Russia should live up to the agreements from the previous Minsk agreement, from that time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate subject, do you have any further information or details on the Keystone bill that\'s has been voted on in Congress, and when the President might plan to veto it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on that.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the approval process for this pipeline is one that predates this administration, and is hubbed at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to let that process unfold.\xc2\xa0 The President has announced that he would oppose and veto any legislative maneuvering to circumvent that process.\xc2\xa0 So he will indeed be vetoing it.\xc2\xa0 But again, I don\'t even think they\xe2\x80\x99ve sent the bill over or even announced when the bill would come over.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he could have this while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Palm Springs, I think.\xc2\xa0 Is that not true?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans have said they won\'t send it over until after their recess next week.\xc2\xa0 Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to veto it.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of whether he would do that in some sort of public, \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m vetoing this, I told you again and again I\'m going to veto\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Or would he do it behind closed doors, in private or something?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any rollout plans to announce for that step that, again, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like it\'s going to be today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on the West Coast.\xc2\xa0 Is he planning to wading in in any way to the court\xe2\x80\x99s dispute?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, our focus on this trip is on the first-ever cybersecurity summit, and consumer protection.\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate the President wading in on that.\xc2\xa0 I do think that our view is this is a conflict that should be resolved at the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a federal mediator right now mediating between both sides, and we want this resolved at the negotiating table and we want it resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- either side ask that the President get involved in some way?\xc2\xa0 Is that something under some circumstance he might consider if this is not resolved quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Our view is this should be resolved at the negotiating table expeditiously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, when it comes to the cyber summit itself, a number of the CEOs -- Tim Cook, notwithstanding -- have decided not to attend personally, and to send other high-level people from their team instead.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering, does the White House see this as a snub, or does the White House see this purely as a scheduling issue?\xc2\xa0 And do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make a statement about the NSA and administration policies, or does it have nothing to do with that, and no hard feelings between everybody?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, I think we are very pleased at the participation across the board for the first annual -- well, not annual yet -- for the first-ever White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at who will be joining us over the next day or so, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking at industry leaders in the tech industry, in the privacy advocacy community, in academia and government, and business leaders from across the board.\xc2\xa0 So we are gratified and we welcome their participation.</p>\n<p>I know that some companies are sending different representatives, but we are pleased at their participation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the decision of those who have decided not to come is to make a statement?\xc2\xa0 Or do you not see it as that, just sort of coincidence?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check with certain companies if they\xe2\x80\x99re not participating.\xc2\xa0 But as I understand it, I think -- and I know we\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of sort of releasing the details, but not only the engagement that we\'ve gotten from tech and business leaders across the board we\'re proud of, but also some of the commitments that are going to be announced over the next day or so are pretty significant.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk more broadly through the weekend, besides this cyber summit?\xc2\xa0 We know he\'ll be attending a fundraiser and we know he\'ll be in Palm Springs.\xc2\xa0 But can you talk to us about will he see any of the players in the California potential Senate race in that Democratic field?\xc2\xa0 Or will he make an effort to not visit with any of them so that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t send a mixed signal?\xc2\xa0 How much politics will be on this trip?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As I suggested, Margaret, our focus and the President\xe2\x80\x99s cause for this trip is the cybersecurity summit.\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate a very robust public schedule beyond tomorrow, beyond Friday.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll let you know if that changes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the cyber end, the President gave a speech on NSA reform a year ago, and you turned out an update about a week ago. The essence of the update was that not very many of the reforms that he discussed have yet been implemented, including the movement of bulk collection of calls.\xc2\xa0 Is the President expected to address the slowness in implementing that plan during the course of the summit?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 David, I\'m not sure I buy the premise of your question.\xc2\xa0 This is something that, as you point out, was very important to the President.\xc2\xa0 He made a speech about it a little bit over a year ago, announced some pretty significant reforms.\xc2\xa0 The report that was issued I think a week ago now did describe and outline some pretty significant progress we\'ve made on this.</p>\n<p>But, as you point out, we\'re not done.\xc2\xa0 And I think that long past this issue fading from the headlines, this is work that a lot of our intelligence officials, the professionals across the interagency are working day in and day out on to make sure that we better strike the balance between civil liberties, privacy, and the security interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The biggest change the President announced in the speech was moving -- a year ago -- was moving the bulk collection to the private sector.\xc2\xa0 Nobody has seemed to be able to give an estimate of when that would happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a status update on that for you. I would say that our focus for this trip, on this summit, is going to be more on cybersecurity and consumer protection, specifically bringing together industry, tech companies, consumer and privacy advocates, members of law enforcement, educators and students to really spur collaboration and adopt best practices.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re also, of course, going to reiterate our call on Congress to pass legislation, which we announced a while ago, which we have been frustrated with on their lack of progress.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a partisan issue.\xc2\xa0 Democrats use the Internet; Republicans use the Internet.\xc2\xa0 I have a feeling both Democrats and Republicans do their share of online shopping.\xc2\xa0 And we believe this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be an issue that\'s bogged down on partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 So we urge Congress to move.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pending legislation up there, a lot of pieces of legislation that could do a lot of good on this front.\xc2\xa0 So we urge them to move quickly on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mayor Emanuel in Chicago has a primary on the 24th.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans to campaign for him?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Katie, as you know, we are looking forward to our trip to Chicago next week.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling updates for you in terms of the details of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be on that trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on a Daily Beast article.\xc2\xa0 Did the White House wait a month to stage a rescue after British intelligence officials passed along information about the American hostages\xe2\x80\x99 location last summer?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I believe your colleague asked my colleague yesterday if there was any sort of delay, and there was not.\xc2\xa0 You can be assured that as soon as the President was comfortable with the intelligence provided and the plan from our military leaders, there was no delay and the President ordered the mission.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the reports there was a second failed U.S. rescue attempt?\xc2\xa0 Did something go wrong with the rescue attempt while the Jordanian airstrikes were going on?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen anything on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the back story on the -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a video with Obama that Buzzfeed put out today on Facebook.\xc2\xa0 Can you fill us in on how that came about?\xc2\xa0 Was that part of the interview he did with Buzzfeed, or is it something you guys -- you all wanted him to do?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, that was conducted after the interview earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you we\'re about up to about -- before takeoff -- about 5.7 million views online since the launch of it at noon, a few hours ago.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re pleased at the response it\'s getting.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve noticed significant ripple effects across social media, so we\'re pleased.</p>\n<p>The enrollment deadline for the Affordable Care Act ends on the 15th.\xc2\xa0 In the past, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of success finding audiences in these sorts of channels to get them to sign up and visit the website.\xc2\xa0 So we believe this won\xe2\x80\x99t be any different.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the video the White House\xe2\x80\x99s idea, though?\xc2\xa0 Or whose idea was it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, actually.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some legislation on the Hill limiting the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to transfer detainees.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a position on that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Joy, thank you for the question.\xc2\xa0 As you know, our position is that the continued operation of Guantanamo Bay the facility there, weakens our national security, and must be closed.\xc2\xa0 We believe this bill puts more constraints on a process that should be actually working faster.\xc2\xa0 And so we oppose this legislation, and the President would veto it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this will be -- President Obama will be back on the fundraising circuit.\xc2\xa0 This is his first fundraiser for the 2016 cycle, tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he looking forward to getting back on the fundraising trail?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken to the President about that. Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not raising money for himself anymore.\xc2\xa0 How does he look at his role going ahead into the final couple years of his presidency?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think as he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about, he has run his final campaign.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is more pleased about that than the First Lady.\xc2\xa0 And his focus, as he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about, is we are just kicking off our fourth quarter of the presidency.\xc2\xa0 As he\xe2\x80\x99s said many times, we have a lot of important work to be done, much of which is going to happen tomorrow in terms of the priority of cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the fundraiser will be?\xc2\xa0 There were some reports that they were having trouble selling tickets.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea, Katie, but would refer you to the DNC for that information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is the President staying when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Palm Springs?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 At a private residence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you that information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance the President would be having any meetings this weekend about the presidential library in any way?\xc2\xa0 Talking about fundraising, or planning, or design, perhaps?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else about the weekend that you can or cannot walk us through in terms of who he\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanging out with, what he\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing in his free time?\xc2\xa0 This is -- I think the Obamas do a trip like they -- Mrs. Obama and the girls usually use President\xe2\x80\x99s Weekend for separate vacation purposes, but I mean, can you sort of talk us through what he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to doing this weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think you have seen the pretty busy, robust schedule for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- again, I would not -- for your planning, Margaret, I would not anticipate a robust public schedule for the duration, the remainder of the holiday weekend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the private schedule?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we assume golf will be --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, the President has been known to enjoy golf in this area of the country before.\xc2\xa0 I would not be surprised if he does so again this weekend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t4:10 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
