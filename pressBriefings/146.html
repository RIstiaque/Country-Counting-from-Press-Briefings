Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:25 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I think you all made note of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in the East Room today about the executive actions that his administration will be taking to make it harder for criminals and other people who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get guns from getting their hands on them.\xc2\xa0 I have, for your convenience, thought to put a little reminder of the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions today.\xc2\xa0 But given the President\xe2\x80\x99s robust remarks, I will spare you a topper but certainly look forward to taking your questions about these steps or anything else that may be on your mind today.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Darlene, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President talked about $500 million for expanding mental health treatment.\xc2\xa0 Can you say what the source of that money is?\xc2\xa0 And does it have to be in the budget that he is going to send to Congress next month?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly would expect that many of the priorities that the President discussed today will be incorporated into the budget proposal that he\xe2\x80\x99ll present to Congress next month.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have seen some interest from Republicans who claim that expanding access to mental health care coverage and better mental health care coverage for Americans would make our communities safer.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve described previously why I\xe2\x80\x99m skeptical of those claims -- primarily because Republicans are prepared, for the 60th time, later this week to repeal the very law that actually did more to expand access to mental health care coverage than any other law that\xe2\x80\x99s been passed in decades.\xc2\xa0 That is Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to call their bluff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the President is certainly serious about doing even more than we\xe2\x80\x99ve already done to expand access to mental health care for people all across the country because there certainly is the reasonable prospect that that would -- that expanding access to mental health care coverage would make our communities safer. And we look forward to Republicans working with us constructively to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you\xe2\x80\x99re skeptical of their claims.\xc2\xa0 Is the President also skeptical of their claims for wanting more money and attention to be paid to mental health treatment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think if Republicans were serious about expanding access to mental health care, then surely they would be able to support those elements of the Affordable Care Act that actually do exactly that.\xc2\xa0 There are millions of Americans that now have access to mental health care coverage that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t previously have access to because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And Republicans are attempting, once again, this week, to vote to repeal that law.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take seriously their claims that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually interested in ensuring that people have access to mental health care.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to call their bluff, test their proposition, and if they actually are willing to work seriously with the administration to invest $500 million in expanding access to mental health care, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be proved wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what preparatory work may have been done either here at the White House through the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office or maybe over at the Justice Department to prepare for the anticipated legal challenges to what the President announced today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A lot of the work on this issue was done at the Department of Justice, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you heard the Attorney General talk about many of these measures on a conference call last night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere certainly were White House officials who were involved.\xc2\xa0 And I would like to take this opportunity to single out a couple of White House officials who don\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of attention but were certainly instrumental in the successful implementation of these actions.\xc2\xa0 That is Michael Bosworth, who serves as the Deputy Counsel here at the White House, and Natalie Quillian, who serves as a Senior Advisor to the White House Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 They were both the points of contact here at the White House for the development and implementation of this policy.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of the steps that the President was able to announce today is thanks to the good work of those officials here at the White House, working closely with the legal experts at the Department of Justice, who, as I mentioned yesterday, were focused on producing recommendations to the President that were well within his legal authority as the President of the United States, but also effective in trying to address some of the problems that exist in the current system.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as the work was being done to sort of figure out what he could do, the administration was also preparing for legal challenges? \xc2\xa0I mean, was it sort of a two-track process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe it as a two-track process.\xc2\xa0 I would describe it as a process whereby attorneys at the Department of Justice were looking for ideas that would address the problem that we have identified, which is that right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s too easy for people who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get guns to acquire them.\xc2\xa0 Too often, guns fall into the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do more to keep that from happening.\xc2\xa0 And keeping that from happening would make our communities safer.\xc2\xa0 So that is the problem that the lawyers at the Department of Justice were focused on trying to address.\xc2\xa0 But they wanted to be sure that any of the prescriptions that they put forward would be well within the President\xe2\x80\x99s legal authority as the President of the United States, as the head of the executive branch.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, can you describe for us any other time when you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President be as physically emotional as he was today?\xc2\xa0 It sort of goes against everything we know about the \xe2\x80\x9cno drama Obama\xe2\x80\x9d persona, stereotype of the President.\xc2\xa0 An issue, an occasion, something that has moved him as he was so physically moved today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Darlene, the President has talked before about how the violence at Sandy Hook Elementary in December of 2012 was the saddest day of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s saying something.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s served as President for almost seven years now. And the President was quite emotional in speaking in this room at this podium on that day, and I think the President explained it for himself that even now, more than three years later, the thought of those first-graders being massacred is terribly sad and really tragic, and one that is emotional for the President of the United States, who also happens to have two daughters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the emotional reaction that the President has, even three years later, I think is familiar to millions of Americans across the country who -- particularly parents, who envision their own kids in school.\xc2\xa0 I think this is a very emotional issue and a terribly tragic situation, and one that I think does a lot to animate the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to try to do something about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he has been profoundly disappointed that despite this tragedy, Congress has not felt the same obligation to try to do something about it.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of 23 executive actions about a month or so after that terrible incident I think was pretty clear evidence of the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to try to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0 And I think even three years later, a new set of executive actions that the President announced today are a vivid illustration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing determination to try to keep guns out of the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 More on the gun guidance.\xc2\xa0 Is the change, as far as background checks and ensuring that dealers on the Internet, gun shows, other places, that they are adhering to background checks -- is that change contingent on having 200 new ATF agents and investigators to enforce it?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems unlikely that Congress would approve funding for those measures. So is that contingent on getting the 200 new agents?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the point that you\xe2\x80\x99re making highlights one of the most vivid contradictions in the position that is advocated by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Many of the statements criticizing the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions that littered all of your inboxes today have noted the need for the federal government to more effectively enforce the law that\'s on the books. \xc2\xa0Well, if Republicans were actually serious about that notion, then why wouldn\'t they support hiring more officers to do exactly that?\xc2\xa0 So, again, it\'s a little hard to take seriously Republican excuses for inaction when they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to back up their suggested prescriptions that they believe would be more effective in trying to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to answer your question more directly, no, it is not contingent on the ability of the federal government to hire additional ATF agents.\xc2\xa0 This guidance has been issued and it certainly does clarify that anybody who is engaged in the business of selling firearms has to get a license and to make sure that their customers are getting a background check before their customers are able to purchase a weapon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the ATF, using the resources they have now, will enforce the law accordingly.\xc2\xa0 Those who are engaged in the business of selling firearms that do choose to go without a license and do not force their customers to undergo a background check will be subject to a substantial criminal penalty.\xc2\xa0 This is a statute that carries with it a criminal penalty on the order of up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.\xc2\xa0 So this is a serious law that the ATF is committed to seriously enforcing.\xc2\xa0 And the President has suggested that we should devote greater resources to enforcing the law that\'s on the books.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, that is a position that Republicans themselves have advocated as recently as today.\xc2\xa0 So we would certainly call on Republicans to back up their news releases with actual legislative action.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when will enforcement actually begin?\xc2\xa0 Attorney General Lynch yesterday said there will be an educational period. Is there a point sometime during this year when there will be a crackdown?\xc2\xa0 Or when exactly does the enforcement start?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly the guidance will begin to be implemented today.\xc2\xa0 And that is one of the benefits of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, that these are actions that can be -- that aren\'t subjected to a protracted rule-making process but rather changes that can go into effect and begin being implemented today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for how it is enforced down the line, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with either the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s office or even somebody at the ATF who could give you some greater clarity about how exactly that will take place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any indication that any Republicans are willing to work with you on these funding issues, any cause for optimism, given, as you say, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals are in line with what they have previously supported?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 But again, we look forward to Republicans actually backing up the promises that are contained in their news releases with actual legislative action. \xc2\xa0I recognize that for this Congress that\'s a relatively novel concept, but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given that many are predicting that there will be challenges in the courts, how optimistic are you that these actions will actually become a reality while the President is still in office?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did note the reaction from the NRA spokesperson to this announcement that seems to downplay the significance of these executive actions.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not an attorney and wouldn\'t even play one on TV, but that certainly seems like it\'s going to hurt their legal case that these are actions that must be stopped and that this is a classic example of presidential overreach if the NRA is now claiming that it\'s no big deal.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly have more confidence in our legal case based on that public reaction than I did before.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President has admitted that comprehensive reform does not seem likely while he is in office.\xc2\xa0 It now seems he\xe2\x80\x99s exhausted all of his executive options here.\xc2\xa0 What will we see from him in the rest of the year?\xc2\xa0 Will he continue in the coming months to sort of rally more public support for this?\xc2\xa0 What will we see going forward?\xc2\xa0 What more can he do?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a budget proposal that will come later this year that will reflect some of the priorities that the President has discussed today.\xc2\xa0 As Ayesha mentioned, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see some steps that are taken by law enforcement to enforce the law consistent with the guidance that has now been put forward.\xc2\xa0 We\'re hopeful that we\'ll have additional law enforcement resources that we can devote to that task.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, I would anticipate that you\'re going to continue to see the President speak out publicly, with passion, on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And I think that could come as soon as the President\xe2\x80\x99s nationally televised town hall meeting that he\'ll be doing with CNN on Thursday night.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\'t be surprised if it makes an appearance during the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address that will be covered by all of your networks next Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jordan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Were legal concerns one of the reasons that the background check measure was issued as a guidance rather than a rule?\xc2\xa0 And are there concerns that a Republican White House would quickly reverse something like that, even more quickly than if you had issued it as a new rule or regulation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not aware of any specific legal concerns.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned yesterday, any action that the President would announce would be something in which he and his attorneys have full confidence is well within his authority as President of the United States to exercise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the benefits of the kind of guidance that the President issued today is that it can go into effect immediately and it can begin being implemented immediately.\xc2\xa0 The rule-making process typically is more protracted and takes longer, and this is something that can be done more quickly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And each time the President has taken action, we\'ve observed that it is not as enduring and oftentimes not as broad as what Congress can do through the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 The reason the President is taking these actions today is because Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done anything.\xc2\xa0 And the President has had to resort to using every element of his authority to do as much as he possibly can to keep guns out of the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, well, gee, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better if Congress acted, I would heartily agree with you.\xc2\xa0 Yes, it would be a lot better if Congress would act.\xc2\xa0 It would be more enduring and it would have an even greater impact.\xc2\xa0 But in the face of what even Speaker Ryan described as legislative failure, the President is determined to do as much as he possibly can to make our community safer by making it harder for those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get guns from purchasing them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a separate topic, is the President aware of the reports that a U.S. servicemember was killed in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 And is there any reaction from the White House on that report?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jordan, I can tell you that the President has been briefed about the ongoing incident in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense has confirmed that one U.S. servicemember has been killed and at least two others have been injured.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to their specific statement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, this does underscore that Afghanistan is a dangerous place and that our men and women in uniform who continue to serve our country there are putting themselves at risk for our own national security.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re deeply indebted to them for their service and their sacrifice, and certainly our thoughts and prayers are with the family of this individual who was killed today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For more details or updates on the situation, though, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, why do you think Republicans believe the President is so hostile towards the Second Amendment?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think because -- I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you could hazard a guess --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If I would hazard a guess, it would be that it is purely politics.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why did the President elect to go with these executive actions?\xc2\xa0 He could have come out at the State of the Union and called for a legislative package, tried one more time to bring Republicans on board.\xc2\xa0 Why not that route?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Primarily, Jim, because we have seen, again, what Speaker Ryan described as legislative failure in this policy area.\xc2\xa0 Time and time again, Congress has failed to act, even in the face of unspeakable, tragic violence like what we saw in Newtown, Connecticut, but also in subsequent mass shootings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we also see are the types of acts of gun violence that are similarly tragic but now so common that they barely rate as news.\xc2\xa0 And even those overwhelming numbers -- 30,000 gun deaths in America every year; over the last decade, more than 20,000 children under the age of 18 have been killed by firearms; hundreds of law enforcement officials have been shot and killed over the last 10 years -- if none of that is going to convince Congress to take steps, common-sense steps that would prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure one more speech from even this persuasive President of the United States was going to compel the kind of action that the President clearly believes is needed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only way I think at this point that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see congressional action is when those who share the President\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about gun safety and the need to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands make clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re as passionate about this issue as those on the other side are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is that those on the President\xe2\x80\x99s side of gun safety far outnumber those on the other side of the debate.\xc2\xa0 But what we need to see on this side of the argument is more passion. And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion was on display in the East Room today -- not for the first time, but certainly the most recent.\xc2\xa0 And moving forward, I think the President is hopeful that he can inspire that kind of passion among those who agree with him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear majority of gun owners and even Republicans who agree that some of these common-sense steps, like closing the gun show loophole, are the right thing for the country and would make our country safer, and could be successfully implemented without undermining the law-abiding -- the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re not maintaining that the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions today effectively closed the gun show loophole?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that he has administratively done what was attempted back in the previous Congress, the Manchin-Toomey amendment?\xc2\xa0 Because the guidance -- it seems to rely on a lot of self-compliance and it seems to rely on enforcement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not really saying everybody has to have a background check.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same thing it seems.\xc2\xa0 Is that the right read on this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say in a variety of contexts, executive action is not a substitute for legislative action.\xc2\xa0 And the President taking this executive action today does not in any way absolve Congress of the serious responsibility that they have to take steps and pass legislation that would make it harder for criminals, domestic abusers, and even would-be terrorists from getting their hands on guns.\xc2\xa0 Senator John McCain has sponsored legislation to close the gun show loophole precisely because he said that he knew that criminals and would-be terrorists were using that loophole to arm themselves.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a controversial notion, and this is not an excuse --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that you\xe2\x80\x99ve effectively closed the gun show loophole?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I continue to believe and the President continues to believe that Congress must act.\xc2\xa0 A congressional action, a piece of legislation would be more effective in part because, as you point out, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be reversed by the next President.\xc2\xa0 And so, yes, the President is as determined as ever to see Congress pass legislation.\xc2\xa0 But, again, the President is also quite realistic about how unlikely that is to occur in this Congress.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly would expect that over the course of the next 10 months that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President make a forceful case for people who agree with him about the need to keep guns out of the wrong hands that they should make their voices heard and their opinions on this issue known at the ballot box in November, and not just when they\xe2\x80\x99re voting for President, but also when they\xe2\x80\x99re voting for their representatives in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, are there any directives or executive orders or memoranda coming out along the lines of this gun policy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are no executive orders, but certainly the details on what has been announced today is included in the factsheet that I believe you received last night.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he put it in writing as a memoranda to a Secretary of DHS or HHS?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what sort of administrative paperwork is required to implement the policy that the President discussed today, but we can certainly consult with Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office here and get back to you with an answer on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, does President Obama regret not having taken these actions years ago?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Mark, I think the President certainly regrets that Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t take the kinds of steps that the American public clearly supports.\xc2\xa0 And certainly in the aftermath of Newtown, there was even in the -- look, what happened in Newtown was terribly tragic.\xc2\xa0 And the one silver lining that I think the President and others hoped would come after that terrible event was that it would sufficiently tug at the conscience of members of Congress to take action that would prevent those kinds of incidents from happening again; that it was so graphic and what happened was so grotesque and so tragic that Congress could no longer ignore their responsibility to act. But yet that\xe2\x80\x99s, unfortunately, exactly what they did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd since that time, the President and his team have been looking for ways that the President could take additional action. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve never suggested that that would be a substitute for congressional action, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to call on Congress to take the steps that we believe are necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on one other story, there was a report last week in the Post saying that President Obama scolded aides on the flight back from Asia, feeling that the communications strategy wasn\'t working on U.S. policy against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Did that happen?\xc2\xa0 Were you scolded?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will say, Mark, my wife asked me the same question when she read that story.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I call her?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to do so, if you like.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is this -- is I think the President has made quite clear, certainly not just in his words but also in his deeds over the last several weeks since the terrible incident in Paris and then again even in the aftermath of the terrorist incident in San Bernardino, to be much clearer and much more direct and even more conspicuous in making sure that all of you and the American public understand precisely the strategy that we are implementing to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that is something that the President felt strongly about.\xc2\xa0 And I think a lot of this is rooted in the criticism that has been directed at the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy against ISIL has not been substantive; that we have not seen even the President\xe2\x80\x99s harshest critics advocating a strategy much different than the one that he\xe2\x80\x99s pursuing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are some isolated examples.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the example of Lindsey Graham who, to his credit, had the courage of his convictions and actually suggested that 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 American servicemembers should be deployed to Syria to safeguard the situation there.\xc2\xa0 The President disagrees with that approach, but at least Senator Graham had the guts to put forward his own strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen others like Senator Cruz suggest that somehow the United States and our coalition partners should carpet-bomb Syria, or even potentially carry out a nuclear attack against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of support for that strategy, but he did advocate something different than what the President is already doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut most of the criticism that you hear from the President\xe2\x80\x99s critics, when you ask them what is it that the administration should be doing, they typically recite the list of things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already been doing for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And that is what prompted the President to conclude that we needed to be more effective and do a better job of helping all of you and the American public understand precisely what our strategy is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 James.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 As yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to focus on two subjects.\xc2\xa0 First, guns, and then the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and do this all quickly.\xc2\xa0 You and the President have cited a great number of statistics in the run-up to this moment, so I wanted to share some statistics with you and get your reaction to them.\xc2\xa0 Syracuse University\xe2\x80\x99s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, which uses the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose statistics from the Department of Justice and other federal agencies, records that federal criminal convictions on firearms charges have decreased almost 6 percent from last year; 15.5 percent since 2010; and 34.8 percent since 2005.\xc2\xa0 How do you explain this stark plunge year after year getting bigger year after year under this President of enforcing the existing gun laws?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, James, enforcement decisions are decisions that are made by prosecutors at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to be in a position to second-guess those prosecutorial decisions, but I think there are a couple of things that we could do to help.\xc2\xa0 The first is we could devote more ATF officers and investigators to prosecute -- to investigating these crimes so that prosecutors have more material to work with.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have fewer such investigators now than President Bush had?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the Department of Defense -- or the Department of Justice about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you agree these are stark plunges?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They are, but they reflect decisions that are made by career prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that there are some steps that we could take, consistent with what the President announced today, that could turn those numbers around, which include hiring more ATF officers or even clarifying what exactly the rule is for how people should be licensed and who should actually have to go through a background check.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the guidance that has been issued by the administration today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to that point, you were asked earlier in this briefing if the issuance of some of these executive actions in the form of guidance, as opposed to rules, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the feature of making those particular actions less susceptible to court challenge, and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer that question.\xc2\xa0 So perhaps the way to put it to you in a way that can be answered summarily with a yes or a no is, as follows, did President Obama receive legal advice from anyone at the White House or the Department of Justice to the effect that the issuance of some of these actions as guidance rather than rules would have that feature of making them less susceptible to court challenge?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 James, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to give you much insight into the legal advice that is given to the President of the United States, but I do think that there are legal experts who would observe that the kind of guidance that the President issued today is well within his legal authority as President of the United States to offer --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question is not whether it\xe2\x80\x99s within his authority. The question is whether he\xe2\x80\x99s choosing to use one vehicle rather than the others so he can evade court challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I would describe as the chief benefit of the approach that the President has taken today is that it can be more quickly and effectively implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last on guns.\xc2\xa0 After the shooting of Congresswoman Giffords five years ago, which the President has been noting in some of his remarks lately, there was a kind of a national discourse on the national discourse about guns, and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to use words like \xe2\x80\x9ctargeting,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckilling,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth in the way we discuss not only the gun issue but all kinds of national issues.\xc2\xa0 Today, in his remarks, President Obama accused his political opponents on this issue, which he likes to characterize as the gun lobby, of holding the Congress and the American people hostage.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that precisely the kind of divisive and violence-tinged language that the President himself inveighed against after the Arizona shooting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, James, the President is certainly not advocating violence.\xc2\xa0 But I do think it is an apt metaphor for what exactly is happening right now.\xc2\xa0 There are members of Congress who are quite concerned about the political influence that is wielded by the gun lobby, and that is the most powerful explanation about why they have refused to take action.\xc2\xa0 If there is a more principled one, I\xe2\x80\x99m open to hearing it.\xc2\xa0 But given the toll that we know that gun violence has taken on communities all across the country, this is not just violence that has occurred in Democratic congressional districts across the country, that there are Democrats and Republicans all across the country who have been affected by gun violence.\xc2\xa0 There were Democrats and Republicans standing on that stage with the President today and in the audience today who are concerned about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And that is the point.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to rally the American public to encourage Congress to respond.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly, on the Mideast.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, from the podium, you called on both Saudi Arabia and Iran to deescalate their conflict, and you mentioned calls placed and pending by Secretary of State Kerry.\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence that those calls have been heeded today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, for positions or announcements that may be planned by the Iranians or Saudis, I\'d refer you to them --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you noticed a de-escalation today is what I\'m asking.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I haven\'t heard any new announcements from them that would appear to inflame or escalate the situation.\xc2\xa0 But this is not something that, again, we\'re going to judge based on 24-hour increments, but rather over the long term, can this decades, centuries long sectarian conflict in this region of the world that is being fueled by the leaders of these two countries, that is having a terribly destabilizing influence on the entire region -- can they change that path?\xc2\xa0 It\'s not in the interest of either of those -- the leaders of either of those countries or the citizens of either of those countries to continue to destabilize the region so violently, to continue to foment the kind of violence that often leads to radicalization and terrorism.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is not the kind of path that is going to lead to greater economic prosperity for their citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we believe that we\'ve got a strong case to make when we can go individually to the Saudis, with whom we have a close and strong relationship, but even when we\'re making a case to the Iranians, with whom we do not even have official diplomatic relations, that it is within their interest to try to change the path that they\xe2\x80\x99re currently on.\xc2\xa0 And we won\'t be able to judge within 24 hours whether or not that message will be received or adhered to, but we\'re certainly hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll get the message or at least arrive at that conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing on Iran.\xc2\xa0 On December 7, my Fox News colleagues, Jennifer Griffin and Lucas Tomlinson broke an exclusive story reporting that back on November 21st, Iran had conducted a second illegal ballistic missile test.\xc2\xa0 The United States government has yet to confirm that this second test occurred.\xc2\xa0 Are you ready to do so now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 But if we have more information about those reports to share with you, we\'ll follow up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Byron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Two forward-looking questions for you; the first of which is, can you give us a general idea of what else is on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda for this upcoming year and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in there that might perhaps have some political benefits -- rallying Democratic voters, or getting them excited for the upcoming 2016 election?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take some liberties with your question in one way, which is to say that there is a high priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s for this year that may not rally the Democratic base in the way that you described but certainly has shown some important political momentum just in the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 And that is the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was completed at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 It was endorsed yesterday by the National Association of Manufacturers.\xc2\xa0 This is an organization that typically does not endorse priorities of the Obama administration, but I think is a clear example of how even Democrats and Republicans can agree that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would do good and important things for the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just today, the Business Roundtable announced their endorsement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 This comes on the heels of endorsements from the Farm Bureau and other business organizations that are not typically aligned with the Obama administration who announced their support for this proposal at the end of last year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that certainly is an administration priority.\xc2\xa0 I think we are realistic that there is some deeply entrenched opposition in the Democratic Party to these kinds of measures, but there is bipartisan support for them in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re looking forward to that case and we are pleased to have the assistance of some influential Republicans in making the case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But something that is more focused on what Democrats can support -- I mean, there are a range of things that -- well, let me go to the next sort of legislative priority, which would be criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of Democrats across the country and in Congress that are enthusiastic about the prospect of reforming our criminal justice system in a way that will both make our communities safer but also make our criminal justice system more just.\xc2\xa0 And I think that progress in passing legislation that would do that would be warmly received by Democrats across the country, I believe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is certainly going to continue his advocacy on a range of economic issues that the President knows would benefit middle-class families in the United States and certainly those families that are trying to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to move forward on implementing the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re certainly going to continue to encourage Congress and officials at the state and local levels across the country to raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 Right now the federal minimum wage, if somebody is trying to raise a family of four and working full-time, making the minimum wage, they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to raise that family below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is not consistent with our view that in this country, if you\'re working hard, that you should get a fair shot at success.\xc2\xa0 So the President wants to make those changes and would like to see some of those changes made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some other things that we believe can be done to make our tax code more fair, to close loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and make sure that we\'re investing the proceeds from those reforms into the kinds of things that benefit everybody, like a more modern infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those are some of the things that I think you can anticipate the President will talk about quite a bit over the course of this year and maybe as soon as a week from today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Related, the State of the Union is earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s I think a week from today.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can preview?\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen some reports it might not be the traditional speech.\xc2\xa0 Anything you can share with us?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point, but before the end of the week we\'ll get you some more guidance about what to expect in the speech.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, as in physics, every time there\xe2\x80\x99s an action there\xe2\x80\x99s always an equal opposite reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 So given the fact that the President makes his remarks, every time after he speaks there is a spike in gun purchases in this country.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that is?\xc2\xa0 Why do you think so many people hear this President speak and immediately go to their local gun dealer and purchase a weapon?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know, Peter.\xc2\xa0 You probably have to ask them.\xc2\xa0 I think what we have seen is that there -- because we have seen this pattern so much, I think it is hard for the gun lobby to continue to make the case that putting more guns on the streets somehow makes us safer, but yet that is what they often do.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure it\'s only a coincidence that their ability to make that case is entirely consistent with their profit motive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask people who are making those purchases why they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it.\xc2\xa0 The President did rather conspicuously point out today his -- not for the first time -- his firm belief to the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans to bear arms, consistent with the Second Amendment of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 But again, you\xe2\x80\x99d probably have to ask them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And while we\'ve been speaking -- you spoke about the NRA, the gun lobby, as the President refers to -- and today, the executive director of the NRA\xe2\x80\x99s Institute of Legislative Affairs, Chris Cox, while you\xe2\x80\x99ve been speaking put out a statement and referred to the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in part as another emotional, condescending lecture. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cAgain, President Obama has chosen to engage in political rhetoric instead of offering meaningful solutions to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s pressing problems.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s event,\xe2\x80\x9d he adds, \xe2\x80\x9crepresents an ongoing attempt to distract attention away from his lack of a coherent strategy to keep the American people safe from terrorist attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How does the White House respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks make quite clear his passion and his determination to put in place using his executive authority that will keep guns out of the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that doing so will make our communities safer.\xc2\xa0 People are certainly entitled to disagree, but most Americans don\'t.\xc2\xa0 Most Americans, most gun owners, most Republicans agree with the President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To conclude, 23 million -- I think more than 23 million background checks were conducted in the course of 2015.\xc2\xa0 By some accounts, 40 percent of gun sales in this country are completed without any background check.\xc2\xa0 Today the President called for -- it will be part of his budget -- 200 or so additional ATF agents will be the new enforcers to try to fill these gaps, as it were. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort of acknowledge the limits to the executive power, the limits to his ability to really effect any real change?\xc2\xa0 Because we\'re talking about millions of sales in this country that will still go --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would make sure, Peter, that you take a close look at all the proposals that we put forward.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that would address the problem that you\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted are some modernization proposals that we have for the background checks system; that an investment in new administrators who can conduct a background check and investment in a new system that would reflect technological advances that have been made in the last couple of decades that would make the system more efficient, presumably would make the system work more quickly, those would certainly address the kinds of challenges that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just raised.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kind of going back to the question of how airtight this would be from legal challenges -- obviously when the President announced his executive actions on immigration he said he was confident that that would pass judicial review, and it was rejected so far in the appeals courts.\xc2\xa0 So did his legal team or did the President himself really take lessons from that setback in the courts to advance a more limited approach here that they believe may pass judicial muster?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take that in a couple different ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe this as a limited approach.\xc2\xa0 I would describe this as an approach that reflects the extent of his authority under the current statute, and that is I think why we would describe these as pretty robust actions that would make it much harder for those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get guns from being able to purchase them.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second is we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very mindful of the fact that our political critics and, in some cases, opponents on this issue were prepared to go to great lengths to try to use the legal system to block the implementation of these actions, and I continue to be confident that they will try to do that.\xc2\xa0 But I also continue to be confident in the legal power of the arguments that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make about how these actions fall well within the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it does strike me that the public statements from the NRA thus far significantly undermine I think any sort of legal claim that they would have that this is some sort of gross infringement on the Constitution if they\xe2\x80\x99re out there on the record saying it\xe2\x80\x99s no big deal.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they can have it both ways.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you were talking yesterday about the President, this kind of serious study to see what would be within his authority to do -- was his legal team kind of influenced at all by some of the rulings -- I mean, a recent appeals court ruling that said that he went too far on immigration -- was he concerned, or was his legal team concerned that result would happen with this executive action?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to have a lot of legal confidence in the arguments that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make later this year before the Supreme Court about the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to reform -- or about the kinds of reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed to the immigration system.\xc2\xa0 But, look, this is not a legal strategy that started with the immigration issue.\xc2\xa0 We saw repeated Republican challenges.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s even one that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing now to the Affordable Care Act -- something that was signed into law by the President almost six years ago.\xc2\xa0 Time after time, even going all the way to the Supreme Court, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered quite closely, our arguments have held up.\xc2\xa0 So we are mindful of the lengths that our opponents will go to, to try to prevent the President from using executive action in this way, even common-sense steps like the President is proposing today.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve been mindful of that at every stage of the process.\xc2\xa0 And I think, frankly, that would be true even if we\xe2\x80\x99d won the appeal at the level of the Fifth Circuit on immigration reform.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I guess when we talk about the statement from the NRA, I mean, do you expect lawsuits?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will certainly not be surprised if there are legal challenges that emerge to this executive action, but I continue to be confident, as the entire administration is, that these actions fall well within the legal authority of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- this sounds like any opposition will be purely politics, I mean, in parts of the speech, I mean, the President is saying, you know, if you love your kids and your country then have the courage to vote, I mean, going so far as to say vote gun rights supporters out of office.\xc2\xa0 How is that not political, just as you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the opponents are?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not denying that this is a political problem.\xc2\xa0 The President has acknowledged this before.\xc2\xa0 The failure of Congress to act even on measures that are strongly supported by the vast majority of Republicans and gun owners I think is an open and shut case when it comes to political dysfunction in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the point that the President is making.\xc2\xa0 And in order to see that change we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see more people be engaged in the political process to solve that political problem.\xc2\xa0 And this is something the President has observed on previous occasions and he reiterated that observation again today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, it is injecting -- he is making this in some ways a political issue going into the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Is that part of what the President is hoping to see as he starts this conversation on gun control -- that it is going to be an issue in the campaign and voters will vote gun control opponents out of office?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict the outcome of the election, but I will feel confident about our political prospects if we can mobilize those Americans that agree with the President of the United States on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We know there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of passion out there on this issue on both sides.\xc2\xa0 But we need to make sure that the passion on the side of people who agree with the President that we need to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands -- those people need to be mobilized.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that they far outnumber the people on the other side of the issue.\xc2\xa0 The polls indicate that -- whether you slice and dice the numbers by region or by political party, by age, or even by gun ownership -- that a majority of Americans agree that it is a common-sense step to make sure that everybody gets a background check, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re purchasing a gun at a gun show.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that even the previous Republican President who was reelected advocated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But yet, in the face of all of that, in the face of terrible real-world consequences of congressional inaction, and in the face of public polls that indicate that the American public strongly believes that action is necessary, Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done anything.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a clear illustration of political dysfunction on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And that is a political problem that demands a political solution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest about this.\xc2\xa0 Opponents of gun safety measures have been very effective in using politics to blunt action in Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been a clear part of their strategy. Every time something like this happens, they try to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that this is ongoing right now, that right now there is somebody at the NRA or some other gun owners group that is sending an email and putting out the call that people should flood their members of Congress with telephone calls urging them to oppose the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we need to see is we need to see people on the President\xe2\x80\x99s side of this issue responding in the same way and with the same passion, and responding the same way on Election Day, too, by making sure that they show up at the polls and making sure they vote for a member of Congress in either party that is willing to stand up for their position on this issue when they\xe2\x80\x99re actually representing their district or their state in the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be required to see the solution that the President would like to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is not just any -- kind of as you were suggesting yesterday, this is the President kind of doing what he can under his executive authority to effect changes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a call to action, a political call to action for voters to make changes in Congress or in the White House -- not change the White House, but for voters.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that voters, if they feel strongly enough about this issue, that they should make their voices heard both now and on Election Day, and that at some point -- the President has made this observation before, that at some point, people who are in favor of gun safety measures -- at some point, they may have to just conclude that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be single-issue voters; that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to set aside the other issues, that this one is going to take precedence over all the others.\xc2\xa0 Obviously people will have to make up their own minds about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of people on the other side of this debate who are single-issue voters, and maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time for people on the side of gun safety and on the side of keeping guns out of the wrong hands to display a similar passion, both in communicating to their members of Congress their passion for the issue but also making clear that there are going to be consequences on Election Day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask a little something off-topic.\xc2\xa0 John King started as acting Education Secretary today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that he may end up remaining in sort of the acting role for the full year.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration give any thought to formally nominating him, or would you think that that would be too hard to get a nomination of that level through a Republican Congress at this point?\xc2\xa0 And if so, if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to remain active, does that limit any of his effectiveness?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, David, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about the Acting Secretary of Education at this point.\xc2\xa0 I would observe, as surely you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with, the record of this Congress in confirming presidential appointees is horrendous, to put it bluntly.\xc2\xa0 Even people who serve in non-political positions, or have been appointed to serve in non-political positions, non-partisan positions, have been mindlessly blocked by Republicans in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me just go to my favorite example, because it is one that is utterly indefensible:\xc2\xa0 Adam Szubin is a financial expert who has served Presidents in both parties.\xc2\xa0 He has been appointed to a position that puts him in charge of wielding some of the most powerful weapons that the United States has to impose sanctions against Iran, either for their ballistic missile program or for human rights violations or for their involvement in terrorism.\xc2\xa0 This office is also responsible for imposing financial costs on Russia for their actions inside of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The office that Mr. Szubin has been appointed to run is also responsible for countering Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations that are seeking to carry out acts of violence against U.S. allies or U.S. interests around the world.\xc2\xa0 No one has questioned Mr. Szubin\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications for the job.\xc2\xa0 The suggestion is not that he\xe2\x80\x99s dishonest or that he\xe2\x80\x99s unqualified or that he is inappropriately political.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s no objection to him serving in that role other than he was appointed by Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why somebody who has been appointed to the job of the Secretary of Education that I think is understandably and even legitimately a more political position would get a more fair hearing from a stridently partisan Republican majority in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, I mean, the White House -- the President feels John King would be a capable full-time Education Secretary.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not in question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is not at all in question.\xc2\xa0 And I think\xc2\xa0 -- look, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that there are even some Republicans -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99d do it on the record -- surely off the record -- I feel confident in telling you on the record that many Republicans in Congress off the record would confirm for you that Acting Secretary King is eminently qualified and would do an excellent job of leading that agency over the next year or so.\xc2\xa0 But whether or not he will actually get a fair hearing in the United States Senate I think is definitely in doubt.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see moving forward about whether or not we choose to appoint him to the job.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Final thing -- does that put any limitations on an Acting Secretary versus a full-time Secretary in that sense, I mean, in the ability to do his job, or to be effective, or to be listened to?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly think when you\xe2\x80\x99re put in charge of an organization as large as the Department of Education that it is helpful and you can be more effective if it is quite clear that you\xe2\x80\x99ve earned the approval of a bipartisan majority of the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think Mr. King is going to be particularly successful whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s confirmed by the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 But his prospects would be strengthened if the process worked the way that it should, which is that his credentials were carefully considered and he were given an opportunity to answer questions, even hostile, unfair, skeptical questions from people who do not serve in the same party.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he would be able to withstand that questioning and make a forceful case about why he would be effective serving in this role.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m skeptical that he\xe2\x80\x99ll get that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isaac.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were talking about voters being single-issue voters on guns. \xc2\xa0Is the President willing to be a single-issue voter on guns?\xc2\xa0 Will he make decisions about who he campaigns for based on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President be quite passionate about this issue and I think you have seen him acknowledge that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see more conviction on the parts of voters and political activists who share the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on gun safety included in the political process if we want to see Congress take the kinds of steps that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make a formal declaration here without having spoken to the President about it, but maybe there will be an opportunity for you at some point to ask the President that question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you foresee a situation where he would campaign for a Republican who\xe2\x80\x99s for gun control?\xc2\xa0 Pat Toomey maybe, or Mark Kirk, both of whom are up for reelection?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President noted today, the President certainly gave Senator Toomey credit for what he had previously done on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a lot of other things on which the President and Senator Toomey disagree, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a scenario where the President is willing to campaign for Senator Toomey, given the significant differences that they have on a whole bunch of other issues that the President also feels passionately about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I have -- again, I guess maybe this is the other way to answer your question, which is the other thing single-issue voters do is they give credit where it\xe2\x80\x99s due, and Senator Toomey, to his credit, did step forward three years ago to co-sponsor bipartisan legislation to close the gun show loophole.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, conceivably, if the President is going to be a single-issue voter himself, he could campaign for Senator Toomey despite all their other disagreements?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I am skeptical that that will happen given the significant other --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s a single-issue voter --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, would the President say to single-issue voters in Pennsylvania that they should be single-issue voters and reelect -- or vote for Senator Toomey because of where he was on gun control even though they may disagree with him on all those other issues that the President also disagrees with?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, Isaac.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that Mr. Toomey\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic opponent, once he has one, will have at least as good of a record as Senator Toomey does when it comes to gun safety and keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them, if not a better one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a contested primary in Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 But I feel pretty confident that a Democratic candidate that he faces off against will be someone who has in their own right a strong record on these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing.\xc2\xa0 In October, Hillary Clinton spoke about some gun control measures that she\xe2\x80\x99d like to see -- at that point that she wanted to see, and one of them was this gun show loophole question.\xc2\xa0 People in the administration seemed to dismiss that as something that would work then.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what changed in the intervening time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised to hear you say that people were dismissive of it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That it can\xe2\x80\x99t really work --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure who those people were.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the question or maybe they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were talking about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just sort of give us another update on the Iran-Saudi disagreement and how it affects U.S. interests in the Syria talks and in the anti-ISIL effort?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been obviously -- a couple of days has passed since this breach has happened.\xc2\xa0 Are you yet seeing problems crop up in these very strong U.S. interests around both the Syria talks and around the anti-ISIL efforts?\xc2\xa0 I have a few questions, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I think the short answer to your question is no.\xc2\xa0 But let me just step back to provide a little context to that answer, which is to say it was very difficult and required a lot of painstaking diplomacy to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia into this process several months ago. There were already sufficient differences between those two countries that it was very difficult to get them into the same room.\xc2\xa0 The only reason that we succeeded in making that case is we persuaded them that their own self-interest in the resolution of the political situation inside of Syria trumped the significant objections that they have about their adversary\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t participate in these talks as a favor to anybody else.\xc2\xa0 They did so because they concluded it was in the interest of their country and their citizens to try to resolve the political situation inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make to them is that their self-interest in trying to reach this political resolution continues to be quite significant.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to participate in a constructive way as we work through that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issues in southern Oregon right now with the group that\'s holding hostage -- perhaps that\'s bad language -- but the building there, there is concern that the -- what is the administration doing in terms of monitoring that?\xc2\xa0 If you are not actively monitoring that at the Homeland Security Department and elsewhere, there is some criticism that this administration is not taking domestic extremism as seriously as it takes foreign extremism.\xc2\xa0 And why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you doing that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me clarify one thing which is that there\xc2\xa0 -- to our knowledge -- at least, I have not been told that there are any hostages involved in this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 But there are --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mistakenly used that word.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clarify --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- to make sure that we\'re all in the same place in this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also just assure you that this is something that the law enforcement officials take quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 The FBI is responsible for enforcing the law and ensuring that the law is followed.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re working closely with state and local officials to respond to this particular situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also just be blunt, Gardiner, about something else, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly clear what the motives or intentions are of the individuals who are involved in this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 The speculation by some is that it\xe2\x80\x99s politically motivated.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say something from here that could be construed as inflaming that situation, so that\'s why over the course of the last 24 hours or so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite circumspect in discussing this issue, primarily because we\'re hopeful that law enforcement officials who are responding and closely monitoring the situation and take it quite seriously will be able to succeed in resolving it peacefully.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, one last.\xc2\xa0 The videos of Anwar al-Awlaki on YouTube have repeatedly turned out to be a factor in radicalizing supporters of al Qaeda and ISIS in the U.S. -- from Boston to San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any regrets about ordering the killing of al-Awlaki since it is now clear that his death has given him the authority of martyrdom?\xc2\xa0 And what does the President think about calls for YouTube and other platforms to take down his material, his early mainstream lectures on Islamic history, as well as his calls for attacks after joining al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 As the President has discussed, Mr. Awlaki was someone who was an active leader of a terrorist organization and was involved in operational planning against the United States and our interests.\xc2\xa0 So it is not just the spreading of propaganda and, in some cases, outright hate speech that totaled our concerns with his actions.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the President and his national security team concluded that the United States would be safer by taking him off the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what was done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More generally, this issue of cooperating with technology companies -- this is part of the discussion that we had last month -- and there is ongoing work by the administration and by technology companies to take a look at the most effective way for us to deal with these kinds of situations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we need to protect free speech and free expression.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, these technology companies don\'t want to see their tools used to propagate hate speech and inspire people to carry out acts of terrorism against innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there has been effective -- there is a precedent, however, for working through these kinds of issues.\xc2\xa0 Law enforcement officials have been able to work effectively with technology companies to counter the proliferation of child pornography, for example.\xc2\xa0 This is something that obviously is spread around the Internet.\xc2\xa0 And law enforcement organizations have been able to work effectively with technology companies to counter it.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the issues are going to be a little bit different, but there is a precedent, at least a framework, for having a conversation about the best way to approach the situation consistent with national security and consistent with the kinds of values that are enshrined in our Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 JC, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the same topic of terrorist videos, supposedly ISIL released a video yesterday of executions of reported British spies.\xc2\xa0 And along with that went a message to Prime Minister Cameron and to the British people, a very threatening message.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 JC, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the videos.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the news reports about them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether or not the intelligence community has authenticated them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may interrupt, Prime Minister Cameron certainly has authenticated it in his own words.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he sent back a rather vociferous reaction to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that the British government and the British people have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States as we have confronted the threat from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the British military has made substantial contributions to our counter-ISIL effort.\xc2\xa0 And there are a range of other steps that the British government has taken to contribute to our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. That is one example of the kind of deep cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom that makes our countries and our citizens more secure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President, over the course of his seven years in office, has sought to deepen that coordination and to make that coordination even more effective than it has historically been.\xc2\xa0 And he has found Prime Minister Cameron to be a very able partner in pursuing that kind of relationship that is so special between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just add, this was supposedly payback to the British people and to Mr. Cameron for their enhanced military activities in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I feel confident -- I did not see Prime Minister Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, but I feel confident in saying that the British people and the leaders of that country will not be cowed, will not be terrorized, will not allow these kinds of videos to strike fear in their hearts or in any way diminish their commitment to succeeding in degrading and ultimately destroying that terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 2:34 P.M.
