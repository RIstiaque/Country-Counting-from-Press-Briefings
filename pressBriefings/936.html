Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:44 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 It is great to have you here today.\xc2\xa0 As you can tell, I have with me the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.\xc2\xa0 This week, as I know you know, President Obama is launching a concerted effort to get Congress to stop the interest rate on student loans from doubling in July.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan is here to talk about that issue with you, to take questions on that issue from you.\xc2\xa0 He can also take questions on other issues related to education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou know, it\'s worth noting that Secretary Duncan oversees the implementation of the President\'s education agenda, his vision for investment in education and education reform.\xc2\xa0 And that latter piece, the education reform, is something that, in a way that is often unnoticed or unmentioned by folks in Washington, has enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 This is another issue that should enjoy broad bipartisan support, because you really have to have a brick in your head not to understand that education is the cornerstone of our economic future.\xc2\xa0 Without it we cannot compete and win in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I give you Secretary Duncan.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 And good afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext week, President Obama is traveling to three states to talk about the fact that interest rates for new subsidized student loans are set to increase on July 1 unless Congress acts to change that law.\xc2\xa0 The rates were set by Congress in 2007, and the current interest rate is 3.4 percent, and it will double without Congress\'s action to 6.8 percent.\xc2\xa0 Based on the average loan amount, this will add more than $1,000 in costs over the life of that loan.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor students who borrow heavily to go to college, it would obviously cost them even more.\xc2\xa0 And we estimate that this interest rate increase will affect more than 7 million families expected to take out new loans this fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt a time when going to college has never been more important, it has also, unfortunately, never been more expensive. Families and students are struggling to meet these costs, and there\'s no reason why we should add to their burden.\xc2\xa0 And I have to tell you, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled throughout the country -- and I was just in Iowa and Wisconsin over the past two days with Secretary Vilsack -- not just in disadvantaged communities, but more and more middle-class families are starting to think college might not be for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s for rich folks.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a real problem with that when we know going to college is the path to the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext week, President Obama will outline the administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to work with Congress to keep interest rates down and spare working Americans this added cost, this added burden.\xc2\xa0 And all of us share responsibility for the cost of college -- from federal and state governments to educational institutions, students and their families.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd because this issue is so important to our economy and to our future, our administration is doing more than ever before to address it and we have a number of proposals in our 2013 budget. With the support of Congress, we have doubled -- doubled -- Pell Grant funding for low-income students, and nearly tripled tax credits for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve lowered the cap on student loan payments to 15 percent of income, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to lower it even further to 10 percent starting in 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, Vice President Biden, and myself and so many others have held town halls all across the country to talk about the cost of college.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve met with university presidents, governors, state legislators and members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And next week, the President will meet with students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the University of Iowa in Iowa City.\xc2\xa0 These three universities are among the nation\xe2\x80\x99s educational jewels, and we should do everything possible to ensure that they remain affordable.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we also know that 2012 marks the 150th anniversary of the Morrill Act, which was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln and created the first public universities.\xc2\xa0 I think we have an amazing opportunity to honor Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s vision and secure our economic future by working together to ensure that college remains affordable for all Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll stop there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take any questions you may have.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, this afternoon the White House is going to be screening a viewing of the movie, Bully.\xc2\xa0 One piece of legislation that will protect LGBT students against bullying is called the Student Non-Discrimination Act to prohibit harassment and discrimination against LGBT students in school.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration prepared to endorse that legislation at this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have to continue to do everything we can to make sure that there is zero tolerance for this.\xc2\xa0 And I met with one of the young women in the movie this morning with her father.\xc2\xa0 This is very personal for me and for the President.\xc2\xa0 We all have children who are in school now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd whenever children are going to school scared, when it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to concentrate on biology and algebra -- so as a country -- hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an unprecedented level of support from our administration -- first-ever anti-bullying summit here in the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about his own experiences there.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many states toughen laws to try and protect students from bullying.\xc2\xa0 Until our children are safe and secure at recess, in the morning, after school -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just physical bullying, it\xe2\x80\x99s cyber bullying, as you know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\'ll tell you, some of my toughest meetings have been with parents who have lost their children who have committed suicide due to the impact.\xc2\xa0 So we all have to continue to work together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think this movie is very tough, it\'s very hard-hitting, but it tells the truth, and hopefully it will create a greater awareness around the country.\xc2\xa0 This cannot be a normal rite of passage; can\'t accept it.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to call next week for a one-year or temporary freeze in the interest rate, or is he going to ask Congress to pass a permanent --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we need to fix it now.\xc2\xa0 We have an immediate crisis, so let\'s fix it right now.\xc2\xa0 But let\'s think about the long term as well.\xc2\xa0 And again, this has always enjoyed bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 We have to educate our way to a better economy.\xc2\xa0 We know the jobs of the future are going to go to those folks with some higher education.\xc2\xa0 And so to not do this together just doesn\'t make sense to me.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you would support a short-term -- such as a one-time freeze?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we need to get the immediate issue dealt with now.\xc2\xa0 But let\'s all work together as a country to work on the long-term issue as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, what do you say to Republicans who call this a created controversy, that this is a deadline that comes out of Democratic legislation, that this is coming up right before an election and that the President is taking it out on the campaign trail?\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to those criticisms?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 The facts are very, very simple.\xc2\xa0 This passed in 2007 with broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 It was signed by a Republican President.\xc2\xa0 We all understand that if we want to keep jobs in this country -- we\'re not competing in our little districts and in our states, we\'re competing against India and China and Singapore and South Korea -- and if we want to keep those good jobs here we have to have an educated workforce.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I have lots of data -- you guys all know this, but over the past year if you have less than a high school diploma, there\'s been a decrease of about 200,000 jobs in this country; if you have some college or an associate\'s degree, an increase of about 750,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 And if you have a bachelor\'s degree or more, we\'ve had about 1.4 million new jobs created.\xc2\xa0 And we know those trends are only going to continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we all have to -- again, this isn\'t a Republican or Democratic or -- I could care less about politics and ideology.\xc2\xa0 This is about we need an educated workforce.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s fascinating to me that in a really tough economic time like this, we have 2 million high-wage, high-skilled jobs that are unfilled because we\'re not producing the employees with the skills that employers are looking for.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t tell you how many CEOs I\'ve met with and the President has met with who have said, we\'re trying to hire now; we\'re not trying to export jobs, but you\'re not producing the workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe don\'t just have a jobs issue now; we have a skills crisis.\xc2\xa0 We have a skills gap.\xc2\xa0 We have to close that skills gap. The only way we do that is to have a lot more young people graduate from college and go on to -- graduate from high school and go on to college.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, you\'re saying that Republicans are wrong to suggest that this is being brought up as a wedge issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 This was passed five years ago in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 No reason it shouldn\'t pass again in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 It was signed by a Republican governor [sic].\xc2\xa0 We have to educate our way to a better economy.\xc2\xa0 That is not a Republican or a Democrat or any issue -- that\'s just a -- that\'s just reality.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you said that it would increase the average loan by $1,000 over its life.\xc2\xa0 What is the life of an average loan?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It depends, but the average is 12 years. It varies.\xc2\xa0 And so for each year this doesn\'t happen it would be an additional $1,000.\xc2\xa0 So if it doesn\'t happen this year, it\'s $1,000; another year, $2,000.\xc2\xa0 And again, right now, we know debt from college exceeds credit card debt in this country.\xc2\xa0 Something is wrong with that picture.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to increase that debt. We need to keep it where it is, at a minimum.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously, we\'ve done so much to try and make college more affordable -- we\'ve talked about Pell grants, Perkins loans increases.\xc2\xa0 We\'re asking for the ability to double work-study opportunities.\xc2\xa0 College has to be affordable for the middle class and for folks aspiring to go to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, many, many, many American families -- again, all types of neighborhoods, all types of backgrounds -- are starting to think college isn\'t for them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a real problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, you have a lot of zest at the podium about this issue.\xc2\xa0 Let me use a term that\xe2\x80\x99s familiar to you -- are you going to put some skin in the game -- going on the Hill, you and the President, talking about this?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll do whatever it takes.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve been out traveling the country every single week talking about this for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve done a number of town halls with the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 The President has been out there.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to three different universities next week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is, again, one where it just -- I know you guys love politics and love all that stuff -- that\xe2\x80\x99s zero of my interest.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not any good at it, don\xe2\x80\x99t care about it.\xc2\xa0 We need a lot more young people to go to college and to graduate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all this is about.\xc2\xa0 And when families start to think that they can\'t afford college, that is not good for those families, for those communities, or for our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you willing to go to the Hill --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Of course.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Whatever it takes, we\'ll keep working it.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, I want to ask you a question about school safety.\xc2\xa0 Today is the 13th anniversary of Columbine.\xc2\xa0 The fifth anniversary of Virginia Tech passed this week.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a lot of lessons have been learned, but from your perspective, what more needs to be done?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a great question \xe2\x80\x93 they don\xe2\x80\x99t have easy answers.\xc2\xa0 I think we as a nation have learned a tremendous amount about the warning signs and about acting very, very quickly when there is an issue.\xc2\xa0 But I just sort of take it right back to the bullying issue, that when we have children or young adults or high school students who don\xe2\x80\x99t feel safe, who aren\'t secure, you can\'t begin to be as effective as you need to and concentrate academically.\xc2\xa0 And so creating a climate that is free of violence, free of fear, where young people can concentrate on what\'s going on in class is desperately important.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think there\'s been a lot of progress.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve actually seen a reduction in violence, which has been very encouraging.\xc2\xa0 But one incident is obviously one incident way too many.\xc2\xa0 And I come at this more as a parent than anything else.\xc2\xa0 I have a 10-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, and I don\'t want them or anyone else\'s children having to worry about this going to school each day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also speak, aside from the bullying aspect, the mental health aspect -- because, for instance, in both of those shootings, that may have played a bigger role than bullying or an atmosphere of violence -- identifying --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s correct.\xc2\xa0 And universities, peers, fellow students, when we\'re seeing something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look right, raising those alarms early and letting folks know that this is a student or a young person or a young adult with some issues that are worrying -- we have to have those conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so often in these situations -- not always, but so often, there\'s some signs, there\'s some indications that this person isn\'t stable.\xc2\xa0 And I think we have to take those -- unfortunately, we have to take those very, very seriously.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not something we can sort of blow through.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, Congressman Kline\xe2\x80\x99s office just issued a statement as you were coming to the podium, basically saying that no one has offered a serious proposal, meaningful proposal to pay for this $6 billion stopgap.\xc2\xa0 What do you see as the way to pay for this so that we are not borrowing more money, adding to --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 The President\'s budget contained a number of proposals to pay for it -- again, something we want to work very closely with Congress to do.\xc2\xa0 And we need to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 We\'re committed to paying for it.\xc2\xa0 Lots of ideas out there -- the President will talk more about them next week -- but absolutely want to work with Congress.\xc2\xa0 I have tremendous respect for Chairman Kline.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had a very, very good working relationship.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is the right thing to do for the country and for his families in Minnesota.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, how would you go about balancing the reality of the cost of college with the concerns up there that allowing more access to more credit would create possibly a student loan bubble down the road and actually increase college tuition?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So again, I think the most important thing we can do is to have young people go to college and graduate.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the best investment we can make.\xc2\xa0 And when that debt is manageable -- obviously if you have no debt that\'s maybe the best situation, but this is not bad debt to have.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\'s very good debt to have.\xc2\xa0 And we have all kinds of data not just around jobs but around how much your earning potential throughout your lifetime goes up from high school graduate to two-years degree to four-year degree.\xc2\xa0 So this is the best long-term investment we can make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we are worried about debt going higher and higher.\xc2\xa0 And so when we have an opportunity to work together in a bipartisan way to prevent that escalation of debt, this is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 I expect folks will step up and do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there is a correlation between more access to student loans and the rise in cost of tuition?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve looked at it really closely -- actually more on the Pell Grant side.\xc2\xa0 The data is very interesting.\xc2\xa0 People say when you increase Pell grants, tuition goes up.\xc2\xa0 If you look over 30 years, over those 30 years, 19 of those years Pell grants went up; 10 of those years Pell grants went down; one year it was stable -- and all 30 of those years tuition went up.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think there\'s a correlation there.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we are challenging -- this is about shared responsibility.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\'re challenging states to continue to invest.\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to lead by example -- huge increases in Pell Grants, the biggest since the GI Bill; Perkins loans, double work-study, make the ALTC permanent.\xc2\xa0 But states have to invest.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t do this by ourselves.\xc2\xa0 And universities have to keep down their tuition and also build cultures around completion.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re trying to do a lot to provide greater transparency and score cards so families can make good choices about which university is going to provide a great education but also be at a reasonable cost.\xc2\xa0 I think that transparency, that shared responsibility is hugely important.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 As far as President Obama and his initiative is concerned, some education -- a delegation from India is in town and they are talking about they\'re opening up 100 or more community colleges in India.\xc2\xa0 So a high-level delegation is coming for a conference in June in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 So where do we stand on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve met repeatedly with my counterpart, the education minister from India.\xc2\xa0 He\'s a remarkable man.\xc2\xa0 And we think we have challenges here -- you\'re trying to go to school at an amazingly rapid rate.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said repeatedly, whatever we can do to be helpful we want to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMy Under Secretary, Martha Kanter, is a former community college president.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time anyone of that stature in our administration -- any administration -- has had that community college background.\xc2\xa0 And so whatever we can do to partner with the leaders from India, we want to do that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very, very ambitious goal, and we want to see them achieve that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow, once India was a house of knowledge and (inaudible) and today, India also has hundreds of thousands of colleges and universities and schools and so forth.\xc2\xa0 So how U.S. can help Indian students and India can help --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all in this together.\xc2\xa0 This is why I really believe a rising tide lifts all boats, and the more we have an educated workforce here in America, the more we have an educated workforce in India, the more we have that next generation of both employees and consumers, that\'s great for the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we want to partner together.\xc2\xa0 We have, I think, still the best system of higher education in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have amazing, amazing community colleges.\xc2\xa0 I was at three over the past two days in India -- not in India -- in Wisconsin and Iowa. And whatever best practices we can share, whatever we can do to help India as they go on this very ambitious growth pattern, growth trajectory, we want to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, what\xe2\x80\x99s so special about these three universities that the President is going to visit besides the states they\'re in?\xc2\xa0 Do they have a higher rate of students using loans or something?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are big flagship universities.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the private four-years, it\xe2\x80\x99s the public four-years that folks are really having concerns about paying for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of universities.\xc2\xa0 Why these three?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Again, these are big, major flagship universities with large student populations, and these are the kinds of families -- middle-class families that are having a hard time paying for this.\xc2\xa0 And what we want is more and more young people going on to these type of universities not feeling that college isn\xe2\x80\x99t for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, yesterday in Iowa I talked to a high school senior who happens to be a twin -- talked to her -- her brother wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xc2\xa0 But she said her family is thinking they\'re going to have choose which one of them should go to college next year. It\xe2\x80\x99s a really deep conversation and no family should have to choose this child or that child.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother young person is one of four in their family -- they\'re trying to figure out does the older one not go, or does the younger one not go.\xc2\xa0 These are the very real conversations -- this is a high school student, East High School in Madison, Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 These are the very real conversations that families are having.\xc2\xa0 They should not have to have those conversations.\xc2\xa0 You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to sacrifice one twin for the other.\xc2\xa0 You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to sacrifice your eldest-born for you fourth-born or whatever it might be.\xc2\xa0 This has to be an affordable opportunity for hardworking Americans, and we need to make sure it stays that way.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said there are a lot of ideas the President has and that the Hill has, Congress has for paying for it, but do you guys have a preferred option?\xc2\xa0 When you go to the Hill what are you going to bring to the table?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re open-minded.\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a number of ideas that the President proposed in his budget.\xc2\xa0 And we want to work hand-in-hand with Congress and we\xe2\x80\x99re not set in one idea.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely want to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 But again, the cost of inaction is I think unacceptably high.\xc2\xa0 This is one where we have to get our act together.</p>\n<p>\n\tCongress is struggling these days -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no question about that.\xc2\xa0 And if there is going to be one issue that folks can unite behind, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a better one than around education and educating our way to a better economy.\xc2\xa0 So for all the past bitterness or fighting or whatever it might be, why not come together and do that right thing for the country?\xc2\xa0 And I think this is a great opportunity for folks on both sides to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, have you already started -- sorry -- have you already started I guess before this announcement today going to the Hill and talking with lawmakers?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to many, many lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve testified two or three times over the past couple of weeks. I\xe2\x80\x99m testifying again next week.\xc2\xa0 And this has been at the heart of what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think people see both the opportunity to do the right thing and the huge cost of inaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about everything from the family side, paying whatever the colleges ask.\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to rein in the dramatic rise in tuition?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So a couple of thoughts there.\xc2\xa0 One big thing is we have proposed in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget a billion-dollar Race to the Top for Higher Education that we have put money behind, again, not just in those states that continue to invest and in those institutions, those colleges -- it would do two things:\xc2\xa0 keep their cost down, and also create a culture around college completion.\xc2\xa0 It can\xe2\x80\x99t just be around access; it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be around completion.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other big piece I think has been the lack of transparency.\xc2\xa0 I think young people and families are making these very complicated decisions, which have been very hard to figure out what this university\xe2\x80\x99s financial aid package is versus this university\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re working to create much greater transparency.\xc2\xa0 Young people want a great education, but they want value for their money as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll put strong incentives out there, also move some resources potentially more towards those universities who are doing things right and away from those that aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And again, we have the best system of higher education in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have 6,000 options -- two-year, four-year, public, private, big, small, whatever it might be.\xc2\xa0 We want young people to make the right choice for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Secretary Duncan.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSeparate from the presentation that Secretary Duncan just gave, I do not have anything else to begin with, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to questions from Julie, the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to follow up on Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday at the "Friends of Syria" meeting, which were happening during the briefing.\xc2\xa0 She essentially called for tougher U.N. Security Council action on Syria, but also acknowledged the likelihood that anything put forward to the Security Council would be vetoed.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s a concern in the administration that continuing to focus on Security Council action, which seems likely to be vetoed, is wasting time as the rebels seem to be losing strength in this area.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 We remain horrified by the reports of significant violations of the ceasefire by the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 Yet again, this regime has failed to keep its word, has failed to, thus far, live up to the obligations it made to honor the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, we are in consultation with Security Council members about next steps.\xc2\xa0 It is absolutely true, and we bemoaned the fact at the time, that an earlier resolution at the Security Council was vetoed by the Russians and the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 And we made clear our displeasure over that, and we made clear our feeling that -- and a feeling that was broadly shared around the world -- that it was an historic mistake to side with the Assad regime, a regime that was, at the time and to this day, brutally killing its own people.\xc2\xa0 I think in the interim, the Assad regime\'s behavior has become all the more clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of anything the Security Council might do, the conversations and deliberations that will take place there, but it is worth noting that we did have unified support around the Annan plan and we do have that support on the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And I think there is greater acknowledgment around the globe as well as within the United Nations and the Security Council of the appalling behavior by the regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that increases the likelihood that a tougher --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about what next steps might look like.\xc2\xa0 We obviously remain supportive of the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 We remain supportive of the steps that are being taken with monitors.\xc2\xa0 But we are also clear-eyed about the failure of the Assad regime to live up to its obligations so far, and we will, of course, engage with the Security Council and, broadly, with members of the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Syria\xe2\x80\x9d on next steps as necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration\'s position still that Assad\'s demise is inevitable?\xc2\xa0 Or are you considering options that would take into account Assad staying in power?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We still believe that Assad\'s tenure, if you will, will come to an end.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously difficult to put a timeframe on that, an end date on that.\xc2\xa0 But he has utterly lost credibility with his own people, credibility with the nations and people of the region, credibility with the nations of the world, credibility with international organizations and regional organizations.\xc2\xa0 His capacity to unflinchingly unleash brutality against his own people in order to sustain his own rule has certainly prolonged his stay in power, but it will not last forever.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is any consideration being given to naming a special outside counsel for the Secret Service scandal, or is that an option that\'s being ruled out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is the first I\'ve heard that raised.\xc2\xa0 I know of no consideration of that nature.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that a couple of the names of a couple of the supervisor agents have come to light, can you say at least whether -- does the President personally know either of those agents?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not aware that he does.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he doesn\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even familiar with the names, although I understand some names have been published.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has spoken about this, as you know, when he was asked in Colombia on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 He wants the investigation that the Secret Service is leading to come to completion.\xc2\xa0 Once that completion is reached, if the result is that the allegations that have been broadly reported turn out to be true, he will be angry about it, as he made clear in Colombia.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is that, as he said then, every member of the United States government who travels to a foreign country on a presidential trip or a trip by a Cabinet member or the Vice President is representing his or her country and every American in this country, and therefore should conduct themselves appropriately at all times.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as I said yesterday and I\'ve said previously, the President does not want to, and I certainly don\'t want to, get ahead of the conclusions of the investigation, make broader judgments while the investigation is still underway.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The director at Secret Service, in a meeting with congressional investigators, voiced concern that these prostitutes were in a room or rooms that had confidential, secure -- security information.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, have steps been taken to make sure that if they were, travel plans or whatever may have been on those computers or papers were no longer relevant?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say two things:\xc2\xa0 One, I am certainly not privy to conversations the director of the Secret Service may have had with members of Congress, or the conversations that those members might have had with you about their conversations with the director.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the investigation is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Specifics like that are not things that I\'m in a position to answer questions on at this time.\xc2\xa0 And matters of security in general, presidential security, are handled by the Secret Service and are generally not things that we discuss for reasons of security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I understand the question and I understand at least hypothetically what a concern like that would be and why it might exist.\xc2\xa0 But I would ask you to patiently wait for the conclusions of the investigation before either the Secret Service or the White House addresses those kinds of questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported I think by The Washington Post, to begin with, that one of the agents in question or one of the officials from the Secret Service in question had on his public Facebook page a picture of him with Governor Palin, with an inappropriate remark about checking her out.\xc2\xa0 This was before the incident this picture had been posted. Does that cause the President or anybody in the White House to question whether or not Director Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s oversight was sufficient?\xc2\xa0 It would seem that that would not be professional either and it would cause -- it might cause somebody to question whether or not Sullivan was engaging in enough oversight and setting the right tone when it came to the behavior of his agents and officers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did see the report that you mentioned. But that represents the entirety of my knowledge about it.\xc2\xa0 I have not had any conversations with the President or others here about that specific report that I assume happened even prior to President Obama taking office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tStepping back, the broader question of behavior or culture of the institution I think is something that I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to address at this time while this investigation into this specific matter and in this case, this specific person, is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Again, once the investigation is concluded, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the Secret Service will have more to say about it, and we may as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would information like that cause the President, in any way, to question whether his confidence in Director Sullivan may be misplaced?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a conversation with the President about this specific Facebook entry or even this agent that you referenced.\xc2\xa0 The two things I would say is that the Secret Service has stated quite clearly, and the President believes, that his security and the overall security of the trip was never compromised in Colombia.\xc2\xa0 He has great faith in, broadly speaking, the Secret Service men and women who protect him and his family, protect the Vice President and members of the traveling staff, protect the grounds here.</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now we want to wait for the conclusion of the investigation into this specific incident before we look more broadly at -- if that\'s necessary -- more broadly at some of the issues of culture or security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President does, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, have faith in the Secret Service, and high regard for the agency and the job that they do protecting him, his family, protecting his predecessors.\xc2\xa0 It is an enormously difficult job, as you can imagine.\xc2\xa0 It involves putting your life on the line regularly, being willing to sacrifice yourself for the sake not just of an individual but for the trauma that any kind of harm that might come to a President would cause a nation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a huge responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And this incident, while it is obviously under investigation and the allegations that are out there are very concerning, it is also important not to forget what the job that the men and women of the Secret Service do on a regular basis for Presidents of both parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday when Ann asked you whether the White House was confident that nobody who was employed by the White House was engaged in any similar activities, you said something along the lines of you weren\xe2\x80\x99t aware of any evidence.\xc2\xa0 Has anybody in the White House looked into whether any of the traveling staff or the advance staff or anyone at all had anything to do with any of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when I got that question yesterday, it was the first time I had heard anything like that.\xc2\xa0 I have no reason to believe -- I do not know otherwise that this did not involve anything but the agents and the military personnel.\xc2\xa0 We are in regular conversation with -- senior members of the White House staff are in conversation with the Secret Service, getting briefed on the progress of their investigation.\xc2\xa0 I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the Secret Service investigation of the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if anybody in the White House has just made sure that none of this was done by anybody employed by the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I am not -- my answer is the same as it was yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans, including Senator Sessions and Governor Palin, have begun to suggest that this incident, coming on the heels of the report about the GSA party in Las Vegas and the breakdown of command in Afghanistan where soldiers were displaying severed limbs, suggests, in their words, a "breakdown in --"</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In whose words?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Sessions and Governor Palin, among others -- a "breakdown in --"</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear that, that was Senator Sessions and Governor Palin.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- "in White House oversight of the federal agencies."\xc2\xa0 What\'s your response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been at war in Afghanistan for 10 years. We were at war in Iraq for nearly nine, I believe.\xc2\xa0 Incidents that have been of great concern have happened in those war zones on, unfortunately, numerous occasions over the numbers of years that our forces have been at war there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe incident that you referred to is terrible.\xc2\xa0 It does not represent the standards of the U.S. military or the conduct with which the overwhelming majority of American men and women in Afghanistan, and before that, in Iraq, conduct themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAny assertion by those politicians that you mentioned should be -- of the nature that you mentioned should be valued at the cost that you paid for it.\xc2\xa0 It is preposterous to politicize the Secret Service, to politicize the behavior of the terrible conduct of some soldiers in Afghanistan in a war that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for 10 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is trying to criticize the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is trying to turn these incidents -- one that\xe2\x80\x99s still under investigation -- into political advantage.\xc2\xa0 And obviously you recognize that; everyone here recognizes that.\xc2\xa0 I think on the face of it it\xe2\x80\x99s a ridiculous assertion that trivializes both the very serious nature of that endeavor that our military has engaged in in Afghanistan, and the very serious nature both of the work that the Secret Service does, the apolitical nature of the institution, and the seriousness of the investigation underway with regard to the Secret Service and the military and the incident in Colombia.</p>\n<p>\n\tCharles.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow quickly on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question about the White House advance staff.\xc2\xa0 Is there no process -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a concern of saying, hey --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- no, I mean, I can tell you what our own news organization --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do is answer questions about random rumors that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about rumors.\xc2\xa0 Has there been some sort of just double-checking to make sure White House advance staff weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in this business?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are -- from the beginning, from the moment that this was made public and an investigation was launched, we have been in regular touch with the Secret Service and obviously with the Pentagon about this incident.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the discussion and the briefing covers a variety of subjects, a variety of both facts and rumors.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do, as I said yesterday, is give a play-by-play or speculate about every rumor that you may have heard from either anonymous sources or just the Internet.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on the investigation itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it could be sort of an internal investigation, if you will, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it or you\xe2\x80\x99re not sharing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no reason, as I said yesterday, to believe that there is a need for that.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk speculatively about where this investigation is going.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that Mark Sullivan has been briefing any member of Congress that has asked for one.\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s he briefing here at the White House?\xc2\xa0 When you say senior officials, can you elaborate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has had conversations with the, I believe, the Chief of Staff, with Deputy Chief of Staff, and maybe others. And there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President asked --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- communications with -- let me finish this part.\xc2\xa0 There may be communications at other -- with other individuals, with other members of the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are -- not just with the director.\xc2\xa0 And they are\xc2\xa0 -- it is a regular conversation so that the White House can be kept abreast of the investigation and steps that are being taken.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has not had a conversation with Director Sullivan.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that he will.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he will be briefed at some point by the Director about the investigation and where it stands and what we know about what happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the three universities that were picked next week, can you explain the criteria of why the universities --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa were picked?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to what the Secretary said.\xc2\xa0 And I guess we can go back to the conversation -- how many -- you would know probably quicker than anybody else in this room, what was the margin in Iowa in 2008?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a large margin, sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Substantial, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'re behind now --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So any state \xe2\x80\x93 actually, not the one I saw most recently.\xc2\xa0 But any state --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not following --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Any state by which we won by that margin, should we not travel there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\'d ask is not the University of Texas --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Great universities, great parts of the country. Also, as you know, Chuck --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just finish.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Chuck, there are a lot of things that go into decisions about travel.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously easier to travel only half the country than the entire length of the country.\xc2\xa0 I would point out, as I did yesterday, that the President was recently delivering remarks in Oklahoma, and while hope springs eternal, I am not prepared at this moment to call that a battleground state.\xc2\xa0 He gave a major speech late last year -- I misspoke, I said Nebraska yesterday -- it was Kansas, as you know.\xc2\xa0 Again, in either case, although Nebraska apparently -- there was the Omaha bifurcation in 2008 -- generally not viewed as up for grabs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where the First Lady is traveling next week --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Generally not perceived to be up for grabs.\xc2\xa0 But Kansas -- are you giving us Kansas?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is it in your battleground list?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but in all seriousness, all of his travel next week is to three battleground states.\xc2\xa0 They\'re all official visits.\xc2\xa0 You say -- it feeds the cynicism that this is all sort of one entity here.\xc2\xa0 Is it -- do you -- I mean, would -- Jay Carney the journalist would be asking the same questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The issue that this concerns the President\'s trip next week, education, is -- as Secretary Duncan, who made clear he does not give a rip about politics, does not believe that education should be a political or partisan issue, and largely unnoted by NBC and other major outlets represented in this room, has not by and large been a partisan issue in this administration -- is what the President is going to be talking about, and the unbelievably important reality that on July 1st, rates for student loans are going to double if we don\'t take action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is a policy issue that will matter greatly to the students of the very large universities the President will be visiting.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo suggest -- again, it is simply not something we accept that the President should not be able to travel all around the country, should not be able to travel to talk about his agenda with the American people that he represents.\xc2\xa0 And if you took seriously all the maps that show states that are battleground states, and therefore would be somehow inappropriate for a incumbent President to visit in a reelection year, he would be severely restricting his ability to go to great big parts of the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he keeps going back to the same places.\xc2\xa0 Knoller can tell you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- big parts of the country.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just going to give you guys this answer because it\'s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And I would point -- Jake and I were talking about this yesterday -- when this story first came out, the Wall Street Journal ran this great graphic about how President Obama had traveled to more battleground states at this stage in the reelection cycle than his predecessor.\xc2\xa0 But what they left out was that they did not consider in 2004 Virginia to be a battleground state.\xc2\xa0 It was solid Republican.\xc2\xa0 But they did consider it for President Obama because he won it against all expectations, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as you know, Chuck, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been around long enough, every President goes to Virginia all the time because it\xe2\x80\x99s an easy way to get out of Washington and get beyond the Beltway and get out into the country.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of ways to make a lot more out of this than there is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, does that mean he has no campaign events in North Carolina, Colorado or Iowa next week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the full schedule, but these are official events where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about the student loan issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a different subject, if I may.\xc2\xa0 The first is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You sure you don\'t want to talk about that some more?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the election in France this weekend.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the White House was closely monitoring this election.\xc2\xa0 And are you confident on the stability of the working relationship with Paris, whoever ends up winning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly monitoring it in the sense that we follow the news, and France is a great, great ally of the United States and will continue to be so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President hope will be achieved --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Does SkyNews take issue with that?\xc2\xa0 The U.S. -- the relationship between the U.S. and France?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re happy you opened this up, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have 90 million subscribers worldwide that are very interested in what goes on in this White House, especially.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one of the questions I have from SkyNews is, what does the President hope will be achieved in solving the eurozone crisis as the IMF-World Bank meetings come to an end here in Washington this weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\'re obviously looking at the eurozone crisis at the IMF.\xc2\xa0 The measures that European governments are taking with regard to the eurozone crisis obviously extend beyond the IMF.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe IMF has an important role to play, as we\'ve always said. It is an adjunct role, it is not a principal role.\xc2\xa0 European governments and banks are taking the lead in that.\xc2\xa0 U.S. contributions to the IMF will not be raised and will remain where they are.\xc2\xa0 But the IMF does have an important role to play.\xc2\xa0 And the Europeans have taken some important steps -- very important steps -- in terms of building a firewall, actions the ECB has taken, reforms undertaken in Greece and Italy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\'s more to be done.\xc2\xa0 And we are always available and extremely engaged with our European allies on this issue -- Secretary Geithner, in particular, Lael Brainard, also at the Treasury Department, and others -- very engaged with our European allies in providing whatever counsel we can to help them deal with this significant challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the GSA spending abuses say about the Vice President\'s effort to crack down on waste in government spending?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 First, with regards to conference spending in particular, which is the matter of concern with the GSA that so outraged the President and led to the actions that have taken place there -- first of all, in September of 2011, the President\'s Office of Management and Budget directed all agency heads to conduct a thorough review of how they are spending taxpayer dollars on conferences.\xc2\xa0 Pending that review, conference-related activities and expenses were not permitted to go forward without signoff by the deputy secretary or an equivalent chief operating officer for each agency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEach agency has established tough internal control and has certified those controls are now in place.\xc2\xa0 Federal agencies have identified and are currently executing on plans to achieve traveling conference cost savings that total nearly $1.2 billion as a result of the President\'s executive order.\xc2\xa0 To date, they have achieved over $280 million in reduced costs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, compared to the same period of time in fiscal year 2010.</p>\n<p>\n\tBroadly, the administration\'s efforts to streamline federal spending on conferences is a part of the President\'s broader campaign to cut waste initiative, which is led, as you noted, by the Vice President, and which has already reduced costs by tens of billions of dollars by eliminating inefficient or unnecessary spending.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve worked to cut excess real estate costs by $1.5 billion; realized over $1.4 billion in cost reductions by slashing spending in administrative areas such as travel, fleet and printing; avoided $4 billion in costs by turning around, downsizing, or eliminating IT projects that were over budget or behind schedule; saved millions in production costs by halting the minting of dollar coins that are not needed -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if you\xe2\x80\x99re a collector -- prevented $20 billion in improper payments, and put an end to skyrocketing contracting costs, exceeding the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal to reduce contract spending by $40 billion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you asked, because the record is quite impressive.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were looking for that one.\xc2\xa0 On another matter, there\'s another bit of legislation tied to the Keystone pipeline. The President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean the Keystone pipeline is yet again tied in a non-germane way to another piece of legislation?\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s the way you want to look at it.\xc2\xa0 Is there a veto threat out that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no other way to look at it.\xc2\xa0 Look, we -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we have a SAP -- we do.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we do.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 What Congress is asking -- in this highly politicized, highly partisan way, attaching a provision on the Keystone pipeline to a piece of legislation that has nothing to do with it, is basically asking -- and the American people should be aware of this.\xc2\xa0 The United States Congress -- very important body, takes American security and sovereignty very seriously -- or should -- is saying that we will, in advance, blind, approve a pipeline, a proposal for which does not exist -- but we\xe2\x80\x99ll approve it anyway -- a foreign pipeline built by a foreign company emanating from foreign territory to cross U.S. borders.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we love the Canadians.\xc2\xa0 They are very close allies.\xc2\xa0 But there is a process in place for a reason, that is run through the State Department that requires this kind of project, because it crosses U.S. border with a foreign country, to be reviewed and approved by the State Department in a very deliberate way.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen this company -- if this company and when this company submits a new route, a new proposal for the route of this pipeline, it will absolutely be given unbiased and appropriate consideration in the proper way, in the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s been done for decades under administrations of both parties, and decided in the manner that it is always meant to be decided.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd partisan efforts to attach it to something and basically to say to the American people it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s coming from a foreign country, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s built by a foreign company and it\xe2\x80\x99s crossing our borders, let\xe2\x80\x99s approve it in advance -- that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable to this President.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would remind you that we are only in this situation because the Congress did this once before already.\xc2\xa0 And we only had concerns originally and delayed the process because, or at least in part because of concerns raised about the original pipeline route by the governor of Nebraska, who is a member of the very same party as those who support this noxious amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrianna.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Keystone, by obviously keeping his options open on whether he ultimately will okay --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He cannot okay and the State Department cannot okay --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 In terms of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- a pipeline proposal that does not exist.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It would be preemptively sacrificing American sovereignty.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But in terms -- sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t indicated any willingness aside from you can\xe2\x80\x99t okay a permit -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the permit, I\'m --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- talking about rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s upset a number of groups from big oil to environmentalists, parts of labor, Democrats on both sides of the issue, Canada.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you making my case about why he\xe2\x80\x99s just doing the right thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems like the only folks who are happy with it are Republicans because they can keep pounding him on the issue. Has it been a detriment to President Obama --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will leave it --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this issue?\xc2\xa0 Has this been a detriment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will leave it to commentators, reporters and others, historians, eventually, to decide that.\xc2\xa0 What I know is that at the time that the delay was announced because of the need to find an alternate route, it was done because there were great concerns about the proposed route and the aquifer in Nebraska.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which have been assuaged.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not at the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a route now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no -- what route?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The route that was submitted to Nebraska yesterday, it goes around the aquifer.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, well, but you just said -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, where has it been submitted?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, like you said yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nebraska.\xc2\xa0 Not to the U.S. State Department, which is where it has to be reviewed.\xc2\xa0 And maybe that will be submitted very soon.\xc2\xa0 And once it is, a process will begin in accordance with existing precedent -- decades of precedent, for administrations of both parties -- and it will be reviewed appropriately.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the route was changed for no small -- how do I say -- I\xe2\x80\x99m getting tired here -- but in large part because the Republican governor of Nebraska asked it to be changed, or asked it not to go through the aquifer there and threaten potentially the water supply of that state.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo does it hurt us politically?\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a keen enough analyst to assess that.\xc2\xa0 What I do know is this is the kind of thing that has to be judged on its merits.\xc2\xa0 As the President said in Cushing, Oklahoma, the company is absolutely welcome to submit a new pipeline proposal and the process will begin again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, it seems the Annan plan right now isn\xe2\x80\x99t working in terms of a ceasefire or pulling back troops.\xc2\xa0 There are some reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re working on a plan B.\xc2\xa0 There are some reports there is no plan B.\xc2\xa0 So which is it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier when I was asked about Syria and the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, we are very concerned about the blatant failure of the Assad regime to fulfill its obligations under the Annan plan, the fact that the ceasefire is clearly not holding, is far from complete.\xc2\xa0 And we will -- if it does not succeed, if there is not a change in behavior by the Assad regime, if the ceasefire does not take place and the other points of the plan are not fulfilled, we will obviously continue to consult with our allies and partners as well as other members of the U.N. Security Council about next steps.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is no plan B?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You will continue to consult --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to consult and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that there --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You will continue to consult for next steps sounds like then there will be a plan B, which would mean there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a plan B right at this moment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It means that there is no need to announce -- we are not prepared to announce an additional step or a new step to be taken either by the United States, by "Friends of Syria," or the United Nations Security Council at this time.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that we are discussing next steps and options with our allies and partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLast one.\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you got a chance to see the latest from the Congressional Budget Office --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I usually wait patiently for the latest, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about it, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to read the whole thing myself.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting here --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This question is going nowhere, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what it\xe2\x80\x99s saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what it\xe2\x80\x99s saying is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposed budget would reduce economic output by some percentage and the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office is reacting to it and saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect you\xe2\x80\x99d make any reaction later today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me see what it is you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check my inbox.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, bless you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe schedule for the week of April 23rd, 2012 -- on Monday, at a time when Americans are engaging in Holocaust Days of Remembrance, President Obama will deliver remarks at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 The President will also tour the museum with, and be introduced by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday morning, the President will honor the 2012 National Teacher of the Year and finalists at the White House, thanking them for their hard work and dedication each and every day in the classroom.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday, the President will travel to North Carolina, Colorado, and Iowa, to launch an effort to get Congress to prevent interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will visit the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Colorado at Boulder.\xc2\xa0 Also on Tuesday, the President will host an on-the-record conference call with college and university student journalists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will visit the University of Iowa.\xc2\xa0 At the event, he will speak with students about the critical need for Congress to act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And on Friday, the President and First Lady will meet with troops, veterans, and military families at Fort Stewart in Hinesville, Georgia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 I hope you have a great weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:30 P.M.
