GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you guys for coming to class being moved outside.\xc2\xa0 I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re wearing your sunscreen.\xc2\xa0 I put SFP 30 on three times, so that\xe2\x80\x99s 90, for any of you keeping track at home.</p>\n<p>This will not be a regular thing.\xc2\xa0 I just thought it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long winter and why not get outside and have a little fun for once in a while.</p>\n<p>So let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a few quick announcements.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re enjoying some beautiful weather here, but out in the upper Midwest, there\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility of bad flooding again this year along the Red River.\xc2\xa0 Lots of good work and preparation have gone into efforts out there to prevent flooding and damage with state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 And Administrator Fugate is traveling to the region over the weekend to ensure that all resources are there that could be necessary.</p>\n<p>The President -- second announcement -- the President is pleased that the House will soon post the health care legislation on the Internet, and then a final vote is coming.\xc2\xa0 Since the House rules rightly provide for a 72-hour public review period, it is clear that a final vote on health insurance reform cannot take place before Sunday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 As a result, the President telephoned the leader of Indonesia and will call the leader of Australia later this afternoon, and told them that he must postpone his planned visits for a later date so that he can remain in Washington for this critical vote.\xc2\xa0 The President now expects to visit Indonesia in June.</p>\n<p>The President greatly regrets the delay.\xc2\xa0 Our international alliances are critical to America\xe2\x80\x99s security and economic progress.\xc2\xa0 But passage of health insurance reform is of paramount importance, and the President is determined to see this battle through.</p>\n<p>Lastly, want to announce that in recognition of the deep ties and strong relationship that President Obama has forged with Mexican President Felipe Calder\xc3\xb3n, President Obama and the First Lady will host President Calder\xc3\xb3n and the Mexican First Lady in a White House -- at the White House for a state dinner on Wednesday, May 19th.\xc2\xa0 The dinner will take place in the context of an official visit by President Calder\xc3\xb3n, during which the President will have an opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues with President Calder\xc3\xb3n, including economic competitiveness, our growing security cooperation, clean energy opportunities, immigration, and other key issues.</p>\n<p>And with that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have a hand in when this health care legislation was going to be posted?\xc2\xa0 I mean, theoretically, he could have urged leadership to post this yesterday, getting him out of town on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Is this a delay that he welcomes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this has, Phil, has been a long, hard process, taken more than a year.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that the House leadership wanting to talk to the full caucus and get a CBO score was the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 Again, we greatly regret the delay in the trip, but at the same time have told the leaders this is an important priority for the President and have -- we\'ll reschedule that trip for June.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he still have confidence this is going to pass?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President still believes we will have the votes, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How close are you?\xc2\xa0 Are you within a handful, or a dozen votes?\xc2\xa0 What do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a number to predict.\xc2\xa0 I think the President, in the calls and the meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s having with individual leaders, is making great progress.\xc2\xa0 I will say I think today\xe2\x80\x99s CBO score provides a significant boost to health reform.\xc2\xa0 It proves that this legislation, if you look at it compared to the previous Senate legislation, provides better consumer protection, greater affordability, greater deficit reduction, and more coverage for the uninsured.\xc2\xa0 So I -- again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s case is strengthened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is the President going to be doing over the next 72 hours to try to push this over?\xc2\xa0 And kind of walk us through the flavor of some of these conversations, if you don\'t mind.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has spent in the Oval Office and on the telephone over the last several days -- he\'ll continue doing so today; met with more than two dozen -- met and called more than two dozen members of Congress.</p>\n<p>But Steve, I think the case the President has made to them is very much the case that he\xe2\x80\x99s made to the American people over the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 We know what happens if we do nothing.\xc2\xa0 We know what happens to rate increases -- with rate increases.\xc2\xa0 We know -- we know we have an opportunity to provide small businesses with a tax cut to provide insurance for their employees.\xc2\xa0 We know what this does for families with children that are suffering from what an insurance company considers a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p>I think all of those are -- all of those are part of the case that he\xe2\x80\x99s making, as well as continuing to say that this is important to get done now.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just as more details about those conversations -- understanding you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us the names of who he\xe2\x80\x99s talking with -- but in terms of the content of those conversations, what is he saying that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already said already?\xc2\xa0 The President has been having conversations like this for over a year.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a new sense of urgency; the foreign trip has been cancelled.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any kind of characterization of the specifics of those conversations?\xc2\xa0 Has the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cListen, the future of my agenda is on the line unless we get this through\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President would be the first to tell you that there will be -- after health care passes, there will be many big issues with which we have to tackle.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a few just over the past week:\xc2\xa0 Financial reform, obviously, is something that is going to take up a great amount of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s time; the Citizens United case and campaign finance, again, being just two of those.</p>\n<p>I think partly the urgency of getting this done now -- and this always happens as we get closer to a vote.\xc2\xa0 And I would say this, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it before:\xc2\xa0 Undoubtedly the insurance increases that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen by WellPoint and Anthem over the past many weeks and many other insurance companies in the individual market where insurance coverage is -- where the health care costs are going up 4 or 5 percent but rate increases are going up 40 or 60 percent.\xc2\xa0 I think that has crystallized people\xe2\x80\x99s desire to get something done this year, because that\xe2\x80\x99s a good preview of what happens if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything -- more letters like that, more stories like Natoma Canfield get told.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes these are the type of problems that he and his administration were sent here to solve.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the flavor of that intensity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So more of the same, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t articulated any kind of personal stake and repercussions if this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get through.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, very clearly the President wants to get this done.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I doubt any member that\xe2\x80\x99s spoken with the President would in any way doubt his strong desire to see this through.\xc2\xa0 So I have no doubt that that\xe2\x80\x99s coming through as well.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Democrat Stephen Lynch, who supported the health bill last year, is now saying he\xe2\x80\x99s probably a \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d vote because he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s disingenuous to do this deem and pass maneuver.\xc2\xa0 I know the Speaker has still not really told everyone how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to work, but the President last night wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell FOX one way or another whether he supports it.\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell us, yes or no, does the President support using this maneuver?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and as you just reiterated, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what legislative process the Speaker will use, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let her decide and announce that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was pretty clear yesterday, just as I was the day before that, that everyone knows what this vote is, everyone knows what this vote is about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t he just tell the American people yes or no, I want the Speaker to do this or I don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 Some Democrats are saying it will harm the credibility of the process.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President is of the strong belief, and quite frankly watching CNN it appears as if you all are of the strong belief that the vote that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have on Sunday is about whether we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have health care reform or not.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t sense that the stories that are coming out are where you are on the rule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the President also last night basically said everybody knows what\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill, but as you said it\xe2\x80\x99s just being put online now.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t really seen it.\xc2\xa0 Since he says everybody knows what\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill, can you tell us whether some of these special deals are still in -- the Connecticut hospital, et cetera?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what he stated, Ed, was that the outlines of what the national -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the outlines of the exchanges and many of the things like that are based on the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 I have not had a chance and I will wait for something to be posted online to go through any of those individual aspects.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing, on the CBO numbers that you were talking about, obviously the most important thing, it seems, to conservative Democrats who are deciding or still on the fence is the long-term budget projections, and specifically CBO says that these numbers are imprecise; even though they\xe2\x80\x99re good in the short-term, they\xe2\x80\x99re imprecise, especially in the long term \xe2\x80\x9cbecause there\xe2\x80\x99s a greater degree of uncertainty\xe2\x80\x9d about the second 10 years of all of this.\xc2\xa0 So how can --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, quite frankly, Ed, in most cases the CBO tends to underfactor, quite frankly, the savings that you generally see on the back end of these things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but giving the spending that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Washington right now, how can the President assure the American people that these projections, which are so far off, are going to turn out to be true?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen numbers change in Democratic and Republican administrations repeatedly.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Ed, I think our reading of this is that CBO has tended to underfactor savings that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to see over the long term.\xc2\xa0 This is their best estimation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the guidepost with which Congress uses for each and every piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>Chip.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In the meetings the President is holding with members of Congress -- and by the way, is he having meetings today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason Altmire was here today.\xc2\xa0 Is he meeting with him?\xc2\xa0 He was here for the bill signing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked about names.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there were -- I assume there have been a number of people that were at a bill signing that probably were spoken to by -- with staff.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who the President has met with today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Congressman Cao of Louisiana was here too.\xc2\xa0 Were they invited to try to get them to vote for this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they played roles in getting the bill -- the very important legislation that the President signed right here just a few hours ago to provide tax credits for small businesses that hire the unemployed.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why they were invited to that ceremony, I think, along with many dozen members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to twist their arms on health care reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that somebody mentioned health care reform while they were here.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- my sense is there are probably not many conversations happening in any place in this town that don\xe2\x80\x99t involved something about health care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his conversations with members, to what degree is he stressing -- is the President stressing the importance of passing health care to his strength as President, the health of his presidency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Chip, I think the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody doubts the desire for the President -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to see this through, the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to get this done.\xc2\xa0 He spent quite a bit of time in the first 15 months of his presidency tackling a problem that he believes we have failed to deal with adequately for 70 or so years.</p>\n<p>Again, after health care passes, I think that we will move on to many other extremely important issues.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got several more bites at the economic apple in terms of small business lending, zero capital gains for small business on the economic side; as I mentioned, financial reform, the Citizens United campaign finance case, comprehensive energy legislation.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt there will be many, many more big issues with which the President deals with.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is one he wants to see through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report out there that says the President told some members that the fate of his presidency depends on passing health care reform.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 Has he said that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- I\'m not aware of that, but I can certainly check again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be out of character for him to say that?\xc2\xa0 Or is that one of the arguments that they\xe2\x80\x99d make?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think nobody doubts his desire to see this through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the trip, why not just delay it one day?\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen Sunday, does that signal that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Scheduling worked throughout the night when it became apparent that the bill wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to post yesterday to see about moving the trip back.\xc2\xa0 We looked through and pulled out what very little padding remained from having moved the trip from Thursday to Sunday, and without -- unless we took off basically extremely early in the afternoon on Sunday, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be possible to do.\xc2\xa0 And we had a speech to the Australian parliament that you don\'t want to call on Sunday and say, hey, is there a way we can move this back a day?\xc2\xa0 So it just at that point seemed obvious to us that the best course of business was to reschedule Indonesia and Australia for June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I talked to one expert on Indonesia today who said there\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous disappointment there that the President had cancelled plans to bring his family.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that might be reconsidered, given that he did spend four years of his life as a child there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously I think those plans will be made as we look toward scheduling in June.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is disappointed based on the relationship that we have with a growing democracy, with an important country in our counterterrorism relationship, in a country that\'s the largest Muslim country in the world.\xc2\xa0 The President looked forward to building off of what he talked about in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to visit both the countries in June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And final question.\xc2\xa0 On deem and pass, or the \xe2\x80\x9cSlaughter rule,\xe2\x80\x9d the President is a constitutional law expert himself.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe it\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional?\xc2\xa0 Would he sign a bill that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He would sign a bill, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not worried that it\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He would sign that bill, yes.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are you worried that the sort of calendar vice grip that you have the House in, with this trip now being gone, that they will take advantage of this delay and maybe dilly dally a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, judging from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on television and in news reports today, I think this is -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a vote on -- the best I can tell you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a vote on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the Senate calendar, you feel confident that everything is going to get done before the Easter recess?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s our strong hope.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our strong hope.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And delay -- not an option in your mind, or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Chuck, I think the President would tell you that this has -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this quite a long time.\xc2\xa0 We want to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are all of these calls right now to House members, or are there some senators now he\xe2\x80\x99s having to call to get them to sign this letter, this potential letter that they would send over to guarantee --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has spoken with a handful of senators over the past several days.\xc2\xa0 And as I said over the weekend, this is a -- the President is involved in talking to both the House and the Senate because this is a two-step process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you confident you have the 51 votes in the Senate?\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have it now -- you know you don\'t have the House votes, I know that.\xc2\xa0 Do you have the Senate votes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not talked with Legislative Affairs about the latest vote count, but again I believe that we will -- this bill will pass the House and then it will pass the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did any Senate leadership ask you to delay this trip?\xc2\xa0 We know plenty of House members have.\xc2\xa0 Did the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you rule out that the President has offered anything in exchange for a vote -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a reelection campaign thing or some sort of bill that they want to take up or immigration or anything like this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, we will -- I expect this President will spend a lot of time on the campaign trail when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to spend time on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that, but anything --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a member of Congress is going to say I\xe2\x80\x99ll vote for health care if you come visit my district and campaign for me.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, on the trip, sort of what it sends -- messaging, how concerned are you that a domestic political \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis\xe2\x80\x9d is not the right -- a domestic political issue, problem, whatever you want to call this right now, delays a international visit like this in a very important region in the world?\xc2\xa0 Are you worried the message that sends to a China or to Indonesia, and how concerned is the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The readout that we got from the calls that the President has made -- again, he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk with Prime Minister Rudd later today -- the readout that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten from those calls is that each of these two countries understands what the President has been working on, what\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in, and the importance that he has in seeing it through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So -- and again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined when this trip would be rescheduled, but I will tell you the President believes -- believed it was an important trip now and believes it will be an important trip based on many of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our export agenda -- a whole host of things that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know I said that was the last question, but you largely have said before, the President can walk and chew gum at the same time.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried that this sends --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- sends a message that in this case you guys are just choosing to stay here and do health care?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, again, I think that the President believed -- again, understand this, that we did not want to wake up on -- or we did not want at 10:00 on Sunday morning to make a call to the Indonesians and the Australians and say, I know we were going to be there in a matter of hours, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be there.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- I think that -- I think that would cause some problems just on common sense and manners.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think the President believed that this was something that was important to him.\xc2\xa0 Both the trip and the legislation are -- I think the President believes that right now the place for him to be is in Washington seeing this through.</p>\n<p>I\'ll wind my way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, this one is on the jobs bill.\xc2\xa0 When the White House was unrolling these various initiatives, the point was made frequently that these were all interlocking integral pieces of one package to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 This is a partial move.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned that given the health care debate and other items that are waiting on the agenda that this is just too slow in coming and that these integral pieces will in fact not be passed by Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mentioned just a few minutes ago I think that the President will soon -- the President and the economic team will soon start working through the next step of this.\xc2\xa0 I know there have meetings already here this past week to talk about the small business aspects, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s, as I mentioned, zero capital gains, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s depreciation, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s $30 billion in lending to small businesses through smaller community banks.</p>\n<p>So we talked about this I think many weeks ago, that the -- we understood that this was not all going to be engrossed in one big bill.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to work through the plans that he\xe2\x80\x99s outlined, either at the -- toward the end of December or in the State of the Union, about ideas that we have to create jobs and create an environment where businesses are hiring again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The $30 billion lending facility sort of looms as the next big fight, given that the proposition is that TARP will be used.\xc2\xa0 Do you think the health care debate sort of damages the landscape for that to pass?\xc2\xa0 And now with the Easter recess coming, you\xe2\x80\x99re moving it at least two weeks down the road.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I take everybody at their word.\xc2\xa0 I think there is not a member on Capitol Hill that when they talk about the economy, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about small business.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that you\xe2\x80\x99d truly want to see politics played with small businesses getting access to greater capital when that\xe2\x80\x99s what many of them tell the President and I think tell members of Congress they need in order to meet their payroll and expand their business.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that politics won\xe2\x80\x99t be played with this, given the politics that are being played with health care for 30 million people?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the voters will have their say on the politics.\xc2\xa0 I note that 11 Republicans decided not to play politics with final passage of a jobs tax credit, despite warnings of what happens if health care goes forward.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the President was and the Congress were sent here to address the problems that people face in this country and that\xe2\x80\x99s what voters want us to see -- want to see us do.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when Dennis Kucinich announced his decision to vote for health care reform yesterday, he said that one of the big motivating factors was his concern about attempts to check quote delegitimatize the President.\xc2\xa0 Do you sense that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not -- I was in a meeting when Congressman Kucinich made his --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those were his exact words.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what in its entirety that meant.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would question the strong desire of the President to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You keep saying that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s largely proven by events.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I think his desire to get it done extends far beyond what I say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take another crack at the enormity of this challenge as viewed from the White House.\xc2\xa0 How much does passage of all of the other future issues that you\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined here today hinge on success on health care reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, at the risk of repeating myself, I think health care is going to pass the House on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 I believe shortly it will pass the Senate and the President will be able to sign all of it into law.\xc2\xa0 And we will wake up a week or two weeks from now with what we talked about a minute ago -- the need to get credit flowing to small businesses.\xc2\xa0 We will discuss financial regulatory reform so that the rules of the road are different than what caused the type of greed and risk-taking on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 So we will wake up and there will be more to do.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s true and safe to say about every day you\'re here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on the fallout from this debate.\xc2\xa0 What are the legal and political assessments here of all of these actions by Idaho, Virginia, different states that say that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to accept rules that require people to have health insurance?\xc2\xa0 And even on gun sales and other federal issues?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look specifically at what they\xe2\x80\x99re arguing on gun sales.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the belief here is that a provision that requires responsibility and accountability in health care is important, that that would certainly meet any constitutional argument.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would say that -- again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President discuss this -- some people say, well, why don\'t you just do half of this?\xc2\xa0 Well, in order to institute provisions that will phase in in the bill for preexisting conditions, ensuring that preexisting conditions don\'t affect anybody ever, you need to have people in the system.\xc2\xa0 If not, you\xe2\x80\x99d have the system be gamed -- you\xe2\x80\x99d have insurance companies, even more than they\xe2\x80\x99re doing now, pick winners and losers to the point where you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have reform.</p>\n<p>So, again, the President and the team believe strongly that what we\'re about to pass and sign into law will meet constitutional muster.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Peter mentioned, there are -- a couple of states have actually passed measures saying that we\'re not going to let a universal mandate go through in our state.\xc2\xa0 Dozens of others are poised to pass similar measures.\xc2\xa0 So can you explain what the disconnect is?\xc2\xa0 When the administration and Democratic leadership says this is going to save states overall billions of dollars, why don\xe2\x80\x99t they see that?\xc2\xa0 Where can you -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the disconnect when they\xe2\x80\x99re saying this is unconstitutional and dozens of states have lined up against it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to explain the physics of politics.\xc2\xa0 I think the CBO discusses in great detail the type of savings that the system is going to see from this.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not the politics is -- whether people\xe2\x80\x99s political agendas are speaking more than what\xe2\x80\x99s on -- what\xe2\x80\x99s best for their constituents, I think that will ultimately be for voters to decide.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Shift topic just a little bit -- Mr. Netanyahu is going to be in town next week.\xc2\xa0 Now with the trip postponed, what are -- can you walk us through plans for bilats?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have not gotten that far down that road yet.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a week ahead tomorrow but I have -- I am not sure they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten that detailed into next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be some bilats, won\xe2\x80\x99t there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, let me have a fuller conversation when scheduling has a chance to breathe a little bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The New York Times reported this morning some talk within the White House of a American plan in the wake of the stalled talks right now.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 Is there talk within the White House --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Roger, our focus is on -- and our focus for the past several days has been on restarting the proximity talks and calling on both sides to take steps to return to the table and to refrain from any type of actions or announcements that would undermine the trust that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to get them there.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what our focus is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No American plan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our focus is on returning to proximity talks.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, from the podium either indoors or outdoors you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the opportunity at times when the President has been misquoted or there\xe2\x80\x99s been a misimpression left about what the President has said in a various conversation, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t availed yourself of that opportunity today to say he has not told members in their conversations about health care that either the fate of his presidency or the strength of his presidency rides on this.\xc2\xa0 Do you wish to correct that impression?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I have not asked him.\xc2\xa0 I generally don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t know?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I said that earlier -- I generally don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you just said that everyone understands he wants to get it done.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to find out if it would be wrong --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think those are mutually exclusive.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to your own reporting rules whether you want to -- how you want to report certain things.\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to the President about whether or not -- whether or not he said that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, the President strongly wants to get this done, Major -- wants to get this done in the House this weekend.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get that done.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, we will wake up sometime next week with a whole set of issues, some of which none of us were thinking about and none of you all were writing and reporting on that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to deal with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you wake up, if health care is passed, will you wake up in a stronger legislative and political position or a weaker one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 An equally sunny day as this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Makes no difference, in other words?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the American public, seeing the stakes as they\xe2\x80\x99re playing themselves out, would naturally conclude that it makes no difference one way or the other to for the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative calendar agenda?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t normally engage in hypotheticals and I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said from the sunny confines of the Rose Garden several times today that I believe that health care is going to pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the CBO scoring, there are a couple of sentences in there that note this is a preliminary analysis and that full reconciliation language hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been fully vetted.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that any numerical or political concern to the White House as it tries to get the final votes in the House?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that has any implications?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a budget expert, Major, but I think that this is a pretty strong indication of the type of sense this makes fiscally.\xc2\xa0 I think that you see that in the first 10 years, this legislation will save more than $100 billion, and over the 10 years after that, more than $1 trillion; greater affordability; greater coverage for the uninsured; stronger consumer protections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, I have no doubt that CBO will continue to evaluate and provide scores for a long time to come, but I think the President is and the administration are strongly encouraged by exactly what CBO reported today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you also note the one caveat -- the additional caveat that this only deals with mandatory spending and has not had time or the requisite data to analyze these discretionary spending implications of this legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not read the full 25 pages that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many of you have.\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to anybody on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State Clinton is overseas in Moscow.\xc2\xa0 There is some suggestion that perhaps the START talks are reaching a moment of culmination.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a general bit of guidance, any readout on that?\xc2\xa0 Should we anticipate something in the near future?\xc2\xa0 Is this something you think will culminate closer to the summit here in mid-April?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have always talked about this in a way that -- the negotiations we want to see produce a deal that moves forward the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of nuclear security and reducing the amount of nuclear weapons in our world; at the same time ensuring that that works for the best interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So that has clearly taken some time to do.</p>\n<p>I think it is safe to say that the President has been more personally involved with these negotiations than you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen in 20 or 25 years.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re certainly hopeful that we get something done.\xc2\xa0 I know the Secretary of State will go to Moscow; I have no doubt that this will come up along with the important meetings that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Quartet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that she has with the Quartet.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think the President -- the President has spent an awful lot of his own time working directly with Mr. Medvedev to ensure that we make the progress that we need on these -- on this START treaty.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the trip, is it understood that it would just be a re-creation of this trip, you would not be expanding it to places like India or something like that in June, or is it a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to make any announcements about the scope of the trip beyond the two countries.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to say that it might not happen.\xc2\xa0 I just know that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s possible, in other words?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that in discussing our cancellation with Indonesia and Australia we mentioned that -- we gave them a window for coming back in June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This might be self-evident but I\'m a bit dense -- is it necessary you think for the President to be here next week for the Senate part of this process?\xc2\xa0 Because the reconciliation process is not guaranteed and there are some anxieties among House Democrats as to what they do will be replicated and passed in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is part of his reason for staying here to be available for that process as well?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously that helps.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I think our focus was most immediately on the vote in the House, and understanding that as a result of the change -- as I mentioned to Chip -- as a result of the likely change in our departure time, that in many ways made the rest of the discussion somewhat moot.\xc2\xa0 It was a very short meeting on whether or not, based on the available evidence we had to make that determination, despite the great importance of the trip.\xc2\xa0 So as a result of it we have the opportunity to be here the rest of this week and all of next.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major covered most of the ground that I -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Density aside, he covered it all?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions on the trip.\xc2\xa0 Did the President actually make --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s got his sunglasses and his Coke out.\xc2\xa0 Do you see --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leaning back --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- margarita for Mr. Garrett, please, margarita.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Oh, double.\xc2\xa0 Easy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s early yet.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 The President actually made the decision to cancel the trip?\xc2\xa0 And when was that made?\xc2\xa0 Was that this morning or last night?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 About 9:45 this morning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And both sides, all sides that have been working on the trip have been trying to produce some agreements on a variety of things, some of which had been, I guess, getting closer, and others had not.\xc2\xa0 Was any -- was that any consideration in terms --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, this was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of like not having time to finish some of the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the only thing we discussed this morning -- it was, as I said, a very quick conversation based on what every -- the scheduling knowledge that we all brought to the discussion that pushing our departure past a very early window in the afternoon, a drop-dead time in the afternoon, would quite frankly have just -- would have affected everything else.\xc2\xa0 We just didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that kind of padding left.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick health care questions.\xc2\xa0 First, did the President call Speaker Pelosi and Leader Reid after he made the decision to cancel the trip to let them know that he was staying?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not gotten a readout that he has, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, I believe Representative Stupak was here earlier for the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For the bill signing, right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for the bill signing.\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to assume that he met with the President over health care or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know who he might have met with.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that he can still get Representative Stupak\xe2\x80\x99s vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think over the past 24 hours, we have seen strong indications from those in the Catholic Church that support our belief that the legislation is about health care reform, and that it shouldn\'t and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the existing federal law.\xc2\xa0 The Catholic Health Association, the order of nuns support -- I think is very important.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw Congressman Kildee\xe2\x80\x99s statement yesterday regarding those developments and how it affected some of his thinking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, I think the President remains engaged on that issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so that leads into my next question, which is that was very significant what the Catholic -- especially what the nuns said yesterday, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is the President or anyone else from the White House engaging in outreach to groups like that?\xc2\xa0 Did the President speak with members of the nuns group or the health associations personally?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President met earlier this week with Sister Keehan of the CHA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where was that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe the meeting was in the Roosevelt Room.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if she also made it into the Oval Office as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you share with us any -- the pitch that he perhaps made to her or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The only thing that -- I did not get a detailed run-down of what the pitch was that he made.\xc2\xa0 I know he was effusive about her support and about her as a person for making the courageous statements that she has.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so fair to say, as a result of that meeting and the letter yesterday, that he does have in fact optimism that he could gain the vote even of someone like Bart Stupak?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President again remains very engaged on this in his discussions with members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one last one, sorry.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But part -- was part of the thinking of staying on, or is part of the benefit that he can be here to actually sign the bill?\xc2\xa0 Because once the House acts, the Senate -- the bill will become law, and in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding the parliamentarian has ruled that the Senate needs to reconcile two existing laws.\xc2\xa0 So does he have a plan to sign the bill after the House acts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we would -- I would describe this much as I have earlier this week that, depending on what the parliamentarian rules and depending on what\xe2\x80\x99s driven down here, if the President need sign a bill, he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly do that.</p>\n<p>Again, the discussion that we had about the trip was, as I said, very, very short, because what -- the developments of the timing of a likely vote and the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to be here for that, that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of discussion about different aspects of the Senate -- being here for the Senate or for the signature largely because, again, that was all mostly moot when we got to the point that -- with a drop-dead time it was impossible to move the trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So assuming passage, do you envision the big bill signing with all the hoopla after the Senate reconciliation or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to get ahead of where the parliamentarian is.\xc2\xa0 If the President needs to sign legislation for this process to continue, many of us would loan him a pen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, sorry, very briefly on the jobs bill again.\xc2\xa0 I know you spoke and the President spoke obviously with delight about having 11 Republicans on board.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a tremendous amount, and do you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For the Republicans this year, it is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 For where -- I\xe2\x80\x99m somewhat struck reading a profile of the leader of the Senate Republicans yesterday -- I think many of you all or your news organizations have quoted his strong desire for bipartisanship, despite the fact that the profile led with what appeared to be a carefully orchestrated plan well before the President was ever involved in the economic recovery package at doing each and every thing humanly and senatorially possible to slow to a grinding halt the progress on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>So I would say given the fact that the bar set apparently before the President was sworn in to not have any Republicans support anything the President does, I\xe2\x80\x99d say 11 is pretty darn good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you accept that, that that has been the Republican plan all along to not support him on anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- Ms. Stolberg, has anybody from the leader\xe2\x80\x99s office sought a correction on the beginning of that profile?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not the author of that story.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up later.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question was about -- but my question was about the jobs bills going forward.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reason to believe you\xe2\x80\x99re going to even get that number of Republicans for these other measures that you are looking to pass?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think if you look at virtually every -- every member of Congress, Democrat and Republican, talks about the importance of small business.\xc2\xa0 If we have the ability to have community banks lend an additional $30 billion to small businesses to meet payrolls and to expand, it\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat hard for me to think what your objection to that would be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But have you had an actual indication from Republican leaders?\xc2\xa0 Have they come down here and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can get on this possibly\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think generally they\xe2\x80\x99ve been supportive of small business, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether specifically there have been, to some degree, vote counts on that.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the Democrats who have come in to see the President, what retribution have they been told they will face if they walk out of the West Wing, go back and vote against the health care bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I addressed this the other day.\xc2\xa0 There was this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot has happened since the other day.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tell me about it.\xc2\xa0 There was a much ballyhooed Internet report that the President wouldn\'t campaign or support anybody that voted against the bill.\xc2\xa0 The President has never made any such declaration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have any of his advisors?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow up on Sheryl\xe2\x80\x99s questions.\xc2\xa0 Have you -- has the White House made a request to the parliamentarian to find out if he has to sign a --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with health care staff.\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I don\'t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\'t know when you\'re going to get an answer from him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if we\'ve asked so I don\'t know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you have to ask, or is this a matter for Congress to ask?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering how it works.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My sense is that they\xe2\x80\x99ll make a ruling and nobody will have to ask.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know what that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ve simply said that we will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sign it if you have to to get the process to continue is what you said.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would not stray from those wise words.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m trying to get at is there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of awkwardness of the President signing a law that includes all the things that the Speaker has been kind of tying herself up in knots to avoid her members voting on.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We discussed this yesterday, Mara.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- the corrections bill --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but what I\'m asking you is do you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- I think deals with much of that almost instantly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right -- well, instantly in the House, but quite a few days later, perhaps, in the Senate, or not at all.\xc2\xa0 So what I\'m wondering is, does he consider health care passed as soon as the House votes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He will consider it passed the House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 It will be passed, period, if they accept the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not passed the House; it\xe2\x80\x99s passed, period.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m talking about -- again, we\'ve always discussed this as a two-step process.\xc2\xa0 The Senate will also be part of this process.\xc2\xa0 Mara, I will let --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But legally, is it really a two-step process, or is it over once the House votes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President has -- look, I wouldn\'t have made it through a semester of law school, so this is not based on some grand legal understanding except to say that there are -- the President has set out things that were in the original Senate bill that will not be in what is ultimately -- what he wants ultimately approved as law.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I don\'t know what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he won\'t be satisfied until the Senate acts?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\'re saying?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s what we\'ve -- I\'ve talked throughout the weekend of the fact that, and mentioned to one of the questions up here, that he\xe2\x80\x99s been actively engaged in discussions with senators.\xc2\xa0 So again, this is something that we\'ve always considered to be a two-step process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But so should we understand that he will not be taking any victory laps or making kind of any statements about the historic significance of this until the Senate acts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think in many -- I will say this, Mara, when the bill passed both the House and the Senate, the President found it be a historical act because that had never happened before.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that we will -- when this bill passes on Sunday, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely hear from the President, as you have at many -- many of the different stops in this process.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Last time around this year the President recorded a video message to the people and government of Iran in honor of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, which happens to fall this Sunday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how he plans to recognize that holiday this year.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to do another video?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, if you could get back to me.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Mark Levin with the Landmark Legal Foundation has prepared a suit against the President that if he signs the health care bill passed by the House without a recorded yea or nay vote required by Article I, Section 7 -- my question on that is, would the President rule out signing future bills such as immigration reform or finance reform you mentioned earlier that are not subject to a yea or nay vote in both chambers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed on a number of occasions, certainly the last time we met inside, that this was -- this is the type of thing that -- the type of rule that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen pass on any number of instances.\xc2\xa0 So I understand that there are those that want to discuss this as being a unique thing.\xc2\xa0 It is not.\xc2\xa0 I stated earlier that when this bill passes the House the President will be happy to sign it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is that still a constitutional argument in favor of it, that it\xe2\x80\x99s been done before?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m unaware -- again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to law school -- I\xe2\x80\x99m unaware that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m unaware of legal suits filed by a similar organization when the Republicans did similar things on legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out signing future bills that didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass both houses by a yea or nay vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a series of legal hypotheticals that both of us seem unprepared to discuss.</p>\n<p>Margaret.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of enjoying the sun.\xc2\xa0 With my skin tone, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have a golden tan by the time we\xe2\x80\x99re done.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in more than normal contact with the Clintons in the last few days as the passage of this approaches in terms of their experience?\xc2\xa0 I mean, has that caused them to talk more with either President Clinton or with the Secretary of State?\xc2\xa0 And I have a second question too.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Mike, do you remember if the President was over here -- she was -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if she was over here earlier in the week or not -- I forget based on the schedule -- but I do not -- I have not gotten a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not about this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- an e-mail that has -- that would denote that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he talked with Senator -- Secretary Clinton yesterday as she was over here with the Irish Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in light of the legal challenges that are most likely expected, is the White House looking at putting together any kind of a special legal team to deal with health care?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the Republicans -- maybe you can put this to rest too, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans put something out saying that Bart Gordon and John Tanner have been promised cushy government positions in exchange for their votes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And what were those positions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those positions are NASA administrator and U.S. ambassador to NATO.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At some point.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think those are -- I think those jobs are currently filled, but -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anybody would think -- certainly the current occupants -- that those are otherwise cushy jobs.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s just not true.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House yet received the communication from Israel on whether it is willing to take the kind of steps that were laid out to show commitment to the peace process?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk about the -- can you kind of characterize the ongoing negotiations, which the White House said the Vice President and the Prime Minister talked about in their phone call yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any conversations besides the one you mentioned with the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything else to add on that.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, who, if any, beyond the President, is meeting here at the White House with other Hill lawmakers on health care?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I imagine that the chief of staff is.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Nancy-Ann DeParle is.\xc2\xa0 Those are the most immediate names that come to mind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Axelrod, Jarrett, by any chance, as well?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I take that back.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I think Valerie has met with groups of people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the criteria to say who meets with the President or who talks with the President, versus talking to Nancy-Ann or Valerie or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think in many ways it depends on -- it depends on what questions.\xc2\xa0 You know, obviously I think sometimes members will come over.\xc2\xa0 Their staff will meet with Nancy-Ann as members meet with the President.\xc2\xa0 Legislative Affairs decides who meets with whom.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another topic, the last question, Black Farmers -- March 31st deadline -- they are very upset, they\xe2\x80\x99re very antsy.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying, you know, they can\xe2\x80\x99t get anything through.\xc2\xa0 The bill is -- the monies are attached in the Senate bill, but they\xe2\x80\x99re saying they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing very negative things; that Hispanics should be paid off as well from these settlements.\xc2\xa0 So what say you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with OMB on where this is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still stand by this for the March 31st deadline?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he showing them that they\xe2\x80\x99ll get their money?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is supportive of the settlement that was reached.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in response to Ann\xe2\x80\x99s question, you said that the President does not engage in any threats of retribution over this coming vote.\xc2\xa0 Would you encourage Democratic leaders in the House and Senate to also forswear any kind of retribution?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would encourage news media not to do that too.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to do.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, typically during --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think the President is talking about and the team here is talking about the merits of making historic progress on health insurance reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, and my only question is, is there sort of -- could there be sort of a good cop/bad cop dynamic here?\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to make those threats because he knows that the leaders will.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no evidence that that\'s -- that that\'s the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the line between appropriate persuasion and inappropriate pressure on a lawmaker?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- seems hazardous for me to get into different examples on.\xc2\xa0 Do you have something specific?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m thinking of the \xe2\x80\x9993 Medicare prescription drug vote.\xc2\xa0 There were some questions --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 2003.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, 2003, right.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m wondering, in light of that and in light of past precedent, have you examined what might be appropriate pressure and inappropriate pressure?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President has -- and the team here are focused on why this legislation is good for the American people, why it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the constituents with the member that they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting with.\xc2\xa0 This is -- that\'s the focus of what these meetings are, not coercion or inappropriate -- I forgot what your term was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And finally, on Sunday, how do you envision administration resources and people being deployed around?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to send people to the Capitol?\xc2\xa0 Will the President be here physically?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President lives right there, so I can assure you he\'ll be here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance that he would go to the Capitol, in other words?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not heard plans for the President to go to the Capitol --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about Cabinet Secretaries and so forth?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with Legislative Affairs on that.</p>\n<p>Glen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Stephen Lynch, the congressman from Massachusetts, yesterday mentioned that he was getting calls from administration folks wanting to talk with him and that he was not particularly eager to engage in those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Have you found -- either the President personally or any of the surrogates that have been reaching out to members -- that people are just simply trying to duck you and don\'t want to talk?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, the President has had an otherwise pretty full schedule on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, while we\'ve been out here, apparently Lieutenant Dan Choi has handcuffed himself to a fence on the White House grounds, according to a report.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the White House was given any heads-up that there would be any kind of civil disobedience like that and whether or not the President has any plans to meet with him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No heads-up that I\'m aware of, and I don\'t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s any meeting scheduled today, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Ann\xe2\x80\x99s question, some labor unions have said that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take some pretty rough steps, if necessary, going so far as to run a third-party candidate against some folks who would vote -- Democrats who would vote no.\xc2\xa0 We have one up in the city who feels that -- who\xe2\x80\x99s going to vote no, and may face some pressure.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House opinion of this kind of tactic and is this something the President would support?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ken, I can only speak for what the President has actively tried to do to get members to support a bill that he thinks provides small businesses and families with far more affordable coverage, reduces our deficit over the next 20 years by more than $1 trillion and covers 32 million more people.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when -- you said you\xe2\x80\x99d given Australia and Indonesia a window for rescheduling.\xc2\xa0 When would you hope to have this nailed down?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Scheduling has been busy nailing and un-nailing for the better part of several days, so I don\'t -- I think, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- we have communicated to them our strong desire to come back quickly, to do so in June.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the dates of that specific window, and I doubt that we would have that trip completely laid out, even at this point -- at this point anyway.</p>\n<p>Tom.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, earlier this week -- sorry, I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, earlier this week, both Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore pointed out that the preexisting condition provision of the legislation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take effect for another four years, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could tell us, was that a concession, and if so, who fought for that and what did they -- what did you get in return?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For adults, that is.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the -- as I described earlier and as the President has described, there are certain things that cannot be instituted until you have everyone in the system.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is a piece of legislation that phases in over the course of many years those changes.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of that phasing in, when that\'s done, preexisting conditions for adults will be outlawed.\xc2\xa0 But understand this -- when this becomes law, an insurance company will no longer be able to discriminate against a child that has -- that they believe or says that has a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s on day one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Children.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s pegged to the mandate then, is that fair to say?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my second question was, during the President\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Bret Baier last night, he seemed rather perturbed by both the number of interruptions and to a lesser degree the process-heavy nature of the questioning.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you, watching that interview, what your reaction was to the conduct and the substance of it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will simply say that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s always better if you -- when you interview the President that you let the President give his answer.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve always found that to be the most effective way to conduct an interview.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:52 P.M.
