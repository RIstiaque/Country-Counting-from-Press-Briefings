Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:00 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here on this magnificently beautiful winter\xe2\x80\x99s day.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just sorry we\xe2\x80\x99re not in the Rose Garden.\xc2\xa0 That would be -- maybe in the spring.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is still time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did it once.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gibbs did it once.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty windy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he get grief?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did you guys give him grief?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Us?\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And hence, we\xe2\x80\x99re here today, inside -- (laughter) -- a kind of musty briefing room.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tBe that as it may, let me, before I take your questions, give you a readout of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s video conference earlier today with President Karzai.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier today, the President held a video conference with President Karzai of Afghanistan, as part of their regular consultations.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai updated the President on the security situation in Afghanistan, which has calmed since the events of recent weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two Presidents discussed a range of issues of mutual interest, including U.S.-Afghan Strategic Partnership negotiations; Afghan-led reconciliation; and regional matters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe leaders noted progress toward concluding a Strategic Partnership that reinforces Afghan sovereignty while addressing the practical requirements of transition.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai updated the President on developments toward Afghan-led reconciliation talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, the President and President Karzai agreed that it is in both our interest to continue a partnership that is based on mutual respect, and they agreed to stay in close touch in the lead-up to the NATO Summit in Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you, Connie.\xc2\xa0 Let me start with the Associated Press\xe2\x80\x99s, Ben Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Iran and Israel.\xc2\xa0 There is a report from Iranian state television, quoting the top leader, the Ayatollah, as praising President Obama about his comments on a "window of opportunity" for diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 And the quote is, \xe2\x80\x9cThis expression is a good word.\xc2\xa0 This is a wise remark indicating taking distance from illusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House sees this as a positive sign and sees it as credible.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, as you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy toward Iran is focused in a very clear-eyed way on Iranian behavior, certainly not on rhetoric of any kind.\xc2\xa0 We are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And Iran continues to violate its obligations, and has demonstrated -- and has not yet demonstrated the peaceful intent of its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have, over the past three years, led the effort to organize the international community in a broad consensus effort to pressure Iran, to isolate Iran, to impose sanctions on Iran that, in an ever-increasing way, put real strain on its economy and real strain on its political leadership.\xc2\xa0 That effort continues.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has made clear since the day he took office that there is an alternative path available to Iran, through negotiations, that is available if Iran makes the decision to live up to its international obligations, to forsake its nuclear weapons ambitions, and by doing so, rejoin the international community of nations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are, as you know, with our P5-plus-1 partners, embarking upon a process to begin again talks with Iran, but again, in a very clear-eyed way.\xc2\xa0 The pressure on Iran will continue.\xc2\xa0 The ratcheting up of sanctions will continue, because the only change in that effort will come -- if it comes -- with a change in Iranian behavior with regards to its nuclear programs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One point I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the other day when the President was talking about Israel and Iran was whether he had actually made any progress in persuading Prime Minister Netanyahu to give more time for diplomacy and to hold off on a preemptive attack.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like he made progress on either of those fronts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, I would say simply that the Israelis, as I understand it, made clear that they have not made a decision about taking that kind of action, which is something that the President had said previously.\xc2\xa0 There is agreement between this administration, this government and the Israeli government on what Iran is doing and where it is in the process of its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We have inspectors on the ground, as you know -- the IAEA does -- so we have visibility into what they\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 And there is great coordination between this government and the Israeli government, between our militaries and between our intelligence officials.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on Iran, you mentioned the P5-plus-1 group.\xc2\xa0 They demanded today that Iran fulfill a promise to let international inspectors visit the Parchin military installation where the IAEA believes explosives tests were being conducted geared to developing atomic weaponry and may have taken place.\xc2\xa0 And is there any concern that this is being delayed -- the access by the IAEA, is being delayed by the Iranians to clear any evidence of this sort?\xc2\xa0 And is the access of IAEA inspectors a condition for going ahead with the talks that have been planned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll make two points.\xc2\xa0 One, as you know, twice requests by the IAEA to send inspectors to this facility have been rejected by the Iranians in the past -- most recent -- I think once fairly recently.\xc2\xa0 And the reason why the inspectors want to visit that facility is because we do -- or the IAEA does suspect the kind of activity that you discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the reports that you mention about activity at the facility, I don\'t have any comment on intelligence matters.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the reports in and of themselves underscore the importance that the IAEA attaches to being able to visit this site because of the kinds of activity that they suspect has taken place there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other subject.\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General today said that the administration\'s oil and gas working group was going to be meeting this week to talk about high -- the rise in gas prices as it investigates possible manipulation, speculation in the energy markets.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- will this group -- what is the goal of this group this week?\xc2\xa0 And have they identified areas of speculation and actions that might be taken to stamp that out?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Department of Justice for specifics about their work.\xc2\xa0 The working group was first set up last year when we saw a spike in oil prices and prices at the pump for Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as I think he noted from this podium, has asked the Attorney General to reconstitute that working group for the same reason -- which is he wants to make sure --he wants the Justice Department to make sure that there are no cases of fraud taking place when it comes to the rising price of gasoline.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\'t have any information as to the work that they\'re doing right now, but I would send you to the Department of Justice for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few months ago, with very little fanfare, the administration announced that it was sending some special forces to Central Africa to help African troops target Joseph Kony and the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Resistance Army.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s this remarkable viral video that you may have seen about who Joseph Kony is, and I was wondering if the administration was planning on talking about this video at all, responding -- given that obviously we have troops in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way in I think four different countries in Africa going after Kony and the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Resistance Army.\xc2\xa0 I guess the first question is, have you or the President, or has anybody in the White House seen this video?\xc2\xa0 And the second question is, what\xe2\x80\x99s the status of our troops there and the war -- and the fight there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of it and have been briefed on it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether the President has, but certainly members of the broader National Security staff are aware of it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure some of them have seen it.\xc2\xa0 I know they have.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs President Obama said upon signing the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act last October, we, "Congratulate the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have mobilized to respond to this unique crisis of conscience."\xc2\xa0 And I think that this viral video that you mention is part of that response -- raising awareness about the horrific activities of the LRA.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd consistent with the bipartisan legislation passed by our Congress in 2010, the United States continues to pursue a comprehensive, multifaceted strategy to help the governments and people of central Africa in their efforts to end the threat posed by the LRA and reduce the human consequences of the LRA\'s atrocities.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would point out, when you mention the U.S. military personnel who are in the region, it\'s approximately 100 U.S. military personnel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then a question about the Netanyahu visit.\xc2\xa0 Apparently he gave the President a gift of the Book of Esther.\xc2\xa0 And some aides to Netanyahu told The Jewish Daily Forward that it was background reading for the President, given the crisis with Iran, and the Book of Esther is about -- I guess it was called Persia at the time.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\'s response to getting that book?\xc2\xa0 And did the President have a gift for the Prime Minister that we don\'t know about yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not discussed with the President that subject or the subject of gifts.\xc2\xa0 I would -- the Office of Protocol might have an answer for you in terms of gifts.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t know about it and I haven\'t had a discussion about it.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m sure the President welcomes any gift he might receive from the Prime Minister of Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Politico.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is actually about a story that Politico reported on today, which is that the President was making calls on Keystone, encouraging Democratic members in the Senate to not vote in favor of it.\xc2\xa0 And why did the President think that that was necessary to get involved at this point yet again?\xc2\xa0 Does he not think that they agree with his position, the State Department\'s position, and so on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it is wrong to play politics with a pipeline project whose route has yet to be proposed -- a fact that the company involved affirmed again this week that they have not yet identified a route for this possible pipeline.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, it cannot possibly be reviewed adequately since it does not exist.\xc2\xa0 And that, despite claims that this would somehow -- this pipeline would somehow solve the pain that families are feeling at the pump today, the company itself has said it would take years before a single drop of oil would flow through that pipeline.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have made clear that the decision made by the administration in January with regards to the Keystone proposal in reaction to the legislation -- the legislative political initiative taken by Republicans in no way judged a possible proposed pipeline on its merits.\xc2\xa0 It was simply because the Republicans decided to play politics with a completely unrelated issue, in terms of the extension of the payroll tax cut, to try to I guess curry favor with some political constituency or the other when there was no way to, in accordance with tradition and regulation, to adequately and properly review a pipeline that would cross an international border.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, that -- there is no proposal to review, and that\'s because the one that was originally proposed that went through Nebraska was opposed by many stakeholders, including the governor of Nebraska, the Republican governor of Nebraska.\xc2\xa0 And his concerns and the concerns of others were viewed by the State Department, which was reviewing the pipeline, as legitimate; and thus the need to delay the project so that it could -- an alternate route could be sought.\xc2\xa0 That route has not been identified yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a report in an Israeli newspaper that the Israelis asked the U.S. to provide them advanced bunker-buster bombs and refueling planes.\xc2\xa0 Was that a request made by the Israelis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In the meetings the President had there was no such agreement proposed or reached.\xc2\xa0 We have obviously, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, high-level cooperation between the Israeli military and the U.S. military and at other levels in -- with other agencies within their government and our government.\xc2\xa0 But that was not a subject of discussion in the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was no request by the Israelis for this advanced military equipment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings, that\'s my understanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is -- and so there is no --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there is a report out there in a news outlet that might not be accurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the U.S. is not providing its Massive Ordnance Penetrator to the Israelis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am simply saying that it is my understanding that there was no such agreement discussed or reached in the meetings the President had.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of cooperation with the Israeli military.\xc2\xa0 We have provided materiel to the Israeli military in the past, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will continue to do that as part of our cooperation with and partnership with the Israeli military.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe the President himself has said there\xe2\x80\x99s never been closer military-to-military ties or intelligence ties between the U.S. and Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he has.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Israel has expressed publicly that they are concerned about the window closing, certainly given their technology.\xc2\xa0 Why not provide them that technology?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t have anything more to tell you about that except what I did, which is it was not discussed -- not -- no such agreement was discussed or reached in the meetings the President had.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally, because we -- I mean, they did meet for almost three hours, 90 minutes together, 30 minutes alone.\xc2\xa0 What did they talk then?\xc2\xa0 Did the Israelis make any requests?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the -- your noting of the amount of time the President spent in his meetings with -- his one-on-one with the Prime Minister and then the broader bilateral meeting, I think appropriately highlights the fact that President Obama has had extraordinary amounts of contact with his Israeli counterpart.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, I think he has met with Prime Minister Netanyahu more than any other foreign leader.\xc2\xa0 And I think that simply speaks to the relationship that we have with Israel; the support we feel for and provide to Israel for its security, and the unshakeable commitment we have to Israeli security; and the unprecedented level of direct support we have provided to Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there was much to discuss, as there always is, in the meetings that the President has with the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 Iran was a major topic of discussion as the President himself has said and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Prime Minister Netanyahu has said, and I think is obvious because of the prominence of that issue right now, but there are other issues that they always discuss -- the Middle East peace process among them.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure when they meet again they\xe2\x80\x99ll have no shortage of topics to discuss at that time.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me -- Laura Meckler.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you in a while.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, this is the only briefing of the week.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m doing a little traveling.\xc2\xa0 The President came out --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, you started it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- took some questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is a follow-up on the Keystone question, which I didn\'t feel like you answered sort of the nub of Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s question, which was why did he feel the need to make these calls?\xc2\xa0 He obviously doesn\'t make calls on every piece of legislation that\'s up there.\xc2\xa0 We understand --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe he does and you just don\'t hear about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- his view.\xc2\xa0 Does he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President obviously has communications with members of Congress with some regularity.\xc2\xa0 We have made our position clear about purely ideological and political efforts to attach legislation regarding the Keystone Pipeline to whatever some members of Congress fancy at the time, right?\xc2\xa0 So it is not -- it is a false -- a piece of false advertising to suggest that somehow passing legislation and having it made law, that Keystone ought to be approved is somehow, A, going to have any impact on the price of gas at the pump, which is very high, and which Americans are having to endure right now; or, B, is responsible policy in any way when there isn\xe2\x80\x99t even a proposed route for that pipeline to travel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does he believe that there is some risk that the Senate Democrats do not understand those points?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we have made these points very clear.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to make these points very clear.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly expect that the Congress will -- or at least we hope that the Congress will act in an appropriate fashion and not waste its time with ineffectual, sham legislation that has no impact on the price of gas and is irresponsible because it, as we\'ve said before, tries to legislate the approval of a pipeline for which there is not even a route.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ll keep making that point in telephone calls from the podium, maybe fly a Cessna overhead with a banner -- something like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how many senators did he call?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specifics for you on the phone calls the President may have made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That he may have made?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He did.\xc2\xa0 Yes, he made some calls.\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll confirm that.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was going to ask you who he called.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a -- no, I don\'t have any names to give you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you have any names to give us later if we followed up with you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President makes a lot of phone -- this one happened to be -- the fact that he made some calls happened to make it into a press report, and I\'m confirming that he did.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to get into individual names or length of conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whether other administration officials also had made calls?\xc2\xa0 In other words, did Joe Biden make calls?\xc2\xa0 Who else in the administration made calls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any readouts of phone calls to give you beyond what I just said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the Virginia trip as well?\xc2\xa0 Could you just sort of put a little meat on the bone?\xc2\xa0 What is the point of that trip, the nature of the discussions?\xc2\xa0 And the Texas part -- is it just a fundraising thing, or does the President think that he\'s postured to win Texas any time soon?\xc2\xa0 And why does he keep going back?\xc2\xa0 He\'s done a lot of Texas stuff.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I mean, I would refer you to the campaign for the political component of this.\xc2\xa0 I would say broadly that there are many supporters of the President in the great state of Texas, and he always looks forward to meeting with as many of them as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of Virginia, he will be speaking broadly about the economy, about reinforcing the trend towards a growing manufacturing sector in this country, and also reinforcing a trend that is very positive that has seen companies bring jobs back to the United States -- the insourcing trend.\xc2\xa0 So those will be the topics.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll get more specifics to you later.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to follow up on Norah because you seemed to be very specific in saying, on the bunker-busting bombs, they were not discussed in the President\'s meetings.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu met with Secretary Panetta --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no information regarding --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other officials maybe talked to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I would refer you to other officials.\xc2\xa0 This was not a discussion -- no agreements of that kind were reached.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- nothing was --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing was discussed --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- in the President\'s meetings, yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s who I speak for here, so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Trip in North Carolina yesterday -- we\'ve been through this before about official trips, campaign trips.\xc2\xa0 It was an official trip yesterday; he was talking about energy.\xc2\xa0 The Charlotte Observer had a story saying that on Sunday night a teacher got a call -- this is a teacher who has been active in Democratic politics -- got a call from an Obama for America official saying, can you come to the event, the President wants to talk to you there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy question is -- obviously the President can talk to Americans, he can talk to supporters, but if it\'s OFA that\'s reaching out to people and it\'s an official trip, why is it not the White House staff that\'s saying, hey, do you want to meet with the President?\xc2\xa0 And if it is OFA doing it, should they be reimbursing the taxpayers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For the meeting with the President?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I haven\'t seen the report.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many others -- this is the only one we\'re aware of.\xc2\xa0 But if OFA is reaching out to people before his official trips and saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it would be a surprise -- I\'m not aware of this report, but it certainly would not be surprising if the President met with supporters when he travels around the country.\xc2\xa0 After all, he did win substantially more than half the vote in 2008.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think you can safely assume that when the President travels around the country, as President and in his official capacity, that he\'ll be meeting with supporters when he does -- as well as people who aren\'t supporters, a point he made in his speech yesterday in North Carolina about how much he likes the Tar Heel state, not least because of the hospitality of its people, even those who don\'t necessarily support him politically.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke out in the news conference about how people need to be careful with their language in general, and he spoke about his own daughters and setting an example.\xc2\xa0 I know he\'s not the language police, you\'re not the language police from this podium to pick on people on the left or the right.\xc2\xa0 But there is a letter that went to the Chief of Staff today from a conservative group, Concerned Women for America, saying that the President should direct this super PAC, on the Democratic side, that took a million-dollar check from Bill Maher, who has had some pretty coarse things to say about conservative women.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I understand the President can\'t -- he\'s not in charge of the super PAC, it\'s an outside thing.\xc2\xa0 But he did bless that PAC and say to his supporters, you should give to this PAC if you want to.\xc2\xa0 So can he also say, give a million-dollar check back if it\'s from somebody who said these things?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the points that you made as you were asking your question are the ones that I will make, which is that we are not, and cannot be, the arbitrator of every statement that everybody makes in the policy and political arena.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a general matter, obviously language that denigrates women is inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 And I think I would point you to what the President said when he was asked about this during his press conference, which is that he chooses to lead by example, or to try to.\xc2\xa0 He chooses to, in the pursuit of a more civil discourse in our public space, he chooses to try to practice that civility himself.\xc2\xa0 And he calls on everybody to do just that.</p>\n<p>\n\tChuck.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of -- it\'s fair to say your denial is being very specific on this report about the bunker, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just don\'t have any --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply about the President and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m just saying that I\'m the President\'s Press Secretary.\xc2\xa0 The President had a lot of meetings with the Prime Minister of Israel that included first -- it was first a one-on-one, and then a broader staff, including other senior officials from his administration.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what I know about the meetings the President had.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday there seemed to be some confusion about what Secretary Panetta said on the Hill about military options regarding Syria and then you guys pushing -- can you clarify what you were pushing back on and sort of the interpretation of what Secretary Panetta said on the Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'d have to give me a specific.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'m aware of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I mean.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Panetta said military options are being put together, and then there\'s a White House official that\'s quoted as saying, no, no, no, no, no, not specific military plans being put into place.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to understand --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Fair point.\xc2\xa0 It might have been me, actually.\xc2\xa0 But the Pentagon, the Department of Defense is always reviewing contingencies and putting together contingencies.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense discussed that in their testimony, and that is obviously true as they discussed it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is not our policy right now -- we are not -- we have made very clear that we do not believe that it is right at this time to contribute to the further militarization of the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing a path with the "Friends of Syria" that we hope will bring a political resolution to the situation there.\xc2\xa0 So I think both are accurate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what you\'re saying is the White House has not directed the Pentagon to come up with some military contingency plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that it is a matter of course in circumstances like this for the Defense Department to look at potential contingencies.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to the Chairman\'s testimony, to the Secretary\'s testimony, and also to the Defense Department in general, about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think as Secretary Panetta made clear, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly made clear, and the President has made clear, we do not think that is -- that further militarizing the situation in Syria is the right course of action.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of military options, Secretary Panetta was now quoted today in an interview with the National Journal, saying that plans to -- potential plans to strike Iran have already been drawn up and are being -- and different options are being drawn up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would give you the same answer, which is that the Pentagon, as I understand it -- and there are better experts than I on this -- but as I understand it, the Pentagon is, as a matter of course, frequently examining contingencies and preparing contingency plans for different possibilities.\xc2\xa0 It would be irresponsible -- perfectly appropriate -- it would be irresponsible not to.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is clear, and it has been clearly stated and restated by the President and others in the past week as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing the situation in Iran and the visit of the Prime Minister of Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to have a plan -- I just want to clarify because the President was very critical of people talking publicly about war, but here -- also the administration is saying, we have a war plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he was asked about it, and that\'s a lot different from loose talk of war, beating the drums of war, without talking about the reasons why you would go to war or the consequences of doing that, which is the point the President made from the podium here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, Chuck, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been exceptionally clear about what our policy is, why we believe and we know there is the time and space to pursue -- to continue to pursue the diplomatic option with regards to Iran as we continue to put pressure on Tehran through sanctions and other measures because that is the best option if we hope to completely resolve this problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s useful that the Iranians know that there are these military options, publicly?\xc2\xa0 Do they now know publicly that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would not speculate about the kinds of insights that other countries might have, but I would be shocked if it came as a surprise to anyone who pays attention to our system of government and the way the Pentagon operates -- that they would be surprised to know that the Pentagon constantly plans for different kinds of contingencies.</p>\n<p>\n\tSteve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russia.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be able to have the same kind of relationship with Vladimir Putin that he had with Dimitri Medvedev?\xc2\xa0 And is such a relationship viable or even desirable given the questions that were raised about Putin\xe2\x80\x99s election, his legitimacy, and some of his anti-U.S. rhetoric?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is our policy towards Russia is based on our interests and not on personalities.\xc2\xa0 And the reset policy that the President pursued after he took office with Russia produced benefits for U.S. national security interests, U.S. commercial interests, and that is why he launched that reset and why he pursued it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe obviously look forward to continuing to cooperate and work with Russia where we agree on issues, and that\'s regardless of who the President is.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I think we had a statement -- the State Department did, I can\'t remember if I did or not -- about the Russia election.\xc2\xa0 But I believe the international observers noted that Mr. Putin won a majority of the vote, but we also note the irregularities that have been reported.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more for you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, this is not a personality-based policy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a policy based on -- an approach based on U.S. national interests and the areas where we can reach and agreement with Russia on things like Iran, on trade and other matters.</p>\n<p>\n\tConnie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the conversation with Karzai, did Karzai ever express condolences for the British soldiers killed, and did he explicitly apologize for American soldiers who were killed?\xc2\xa0 And what does the White House want to see done with the Americans who inadvertently burned the Koran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation into that.\xc2\xa0 You surely would understand that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make any statements about the disposition of that investigation or how it should turn out.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, I don\'t have any more detail for you on the call that the President had with President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the statements by Minister Wardak about the incident and his expressions of regret and condolences in the matter of the servicemen who were killed in the Interior Ministry.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything more for you on the specific conversation the President had.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- do you have any comment --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have any more detail for the -- about the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can Karzai guarantee the safety of the American troops who they are training?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would ask you to refer that question to either the Afghan government or ISAF.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned keeping in touch with President Karzai before the NATO summit.\xc2\xa0 Has the President invited President Karzai to come and tell NATO in person what the progress is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does -- was the President satisfied with the progress that he heard from President Karzai this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I read you a pretty full description of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that there has been some progress towards the Strategic Partnership Agreement that they\xe2\x80\x99ve -- that\'s been under discussion.\xc2\xa0 There has been some calming of the situation in the wake of the Koran burning incident.\xc2\xa0 They discussed that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President of Afghanistan updated President Obama on the Afghan-led reconciliation process, which, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted many times, is essential to the ultimate resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So it was a wide-ranging conversation that covered many topics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve been very forthcoming with President Obama and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s apologies for the Koran burning.\xc2\xa0 Would you just take the question on whether President Obama has ever received an apology or condolences from President Karzai?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I think, Ann, just to take your point, the President issued that apology in a letter about a number of subjects to President Karzai because he\xe2\x80\x99s Commander-in-Chief, and his interest in is in the safety and security of American personnel, both military and civilian, overseas.\xc2\xa0 And it was absolutely the recommendation of the commanding general, as well as the ambassador that that apology be issued.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is putting out this 17-minute film, I guess you could say, very polished and cinematic.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering why does the President think that that approach is necessary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t discussed that.\xc2\xa0 I saw the trailer.\xc2\xa0 I thought it was pretty good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I agree with its sentiments entirely.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glad to hear you watched it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The two minutes of it -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the whole thing yet.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s good.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s narrated by Tom Hanks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an Oscar-winning director.\xc2\xa0 Is the everyday defense of the President\xe2\x80\x99s record not getting through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that I\xe2\x80\x99m no Tom Hanks?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I think as a matter of broad principle, as someone in the communications business, as you are, that we take advantage of every opportunity we can to explain the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies, explain his positions, describe his vision for the country moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And that would apply both as I discuss those matters of policy from here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- not speaking for the campaign, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just taking a wild guess here -- that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\'s the approach they take.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that it is, but if you say so.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think there have been those kinds of things in campaigns in the past, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for here --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Maybe just because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around a little longer than you.\xc2\xa0 But I am willing to accept that there has never been one as good with a better told or more compelling story as this video that I have not yet seen.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is that okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tLeslie, and then Andrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you clarify a little bit on the task force?\xc2\xa0 I know that you had said that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry on the what?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the task force, on the oil prices and speculation task force.\xc2\xa0 Because it was my understanding that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I might have tapped out on that, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was my understanding that it had never really been -- it has not been un-constituted.\xc2\xa0 The President, in fact, said the other day that it was reconstituted.\xc2\xa0 Why did it ever stop?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 And I think the point is that it was constituted in response to the sharp rises -- a sharp rise in the price of gasoline a year ago, roughly.\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department can give you more details about its activity in response to that price surge.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we are seeing now in the last several weeks and months is a new surge in the price of oil, for a variety of reasons that have to do with the oil -- the global oil market.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing then the concurrent spike in the price of gasoline that Americans pay at the pump.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s no fraudulent speculation involved in those spikes in the price.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it should have anything to show given that it hasn\'t until now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think you can -- I would urge you to discuss this with the Department of Justice, but I don\'t think you can credit -- you can\'t say simply -- you don\'t know until you investigate what you might find -- and if whatever they found or didn\'t find a year ago is not dispositive towards what they might find or might not find as they investigate going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President feels that it\'s in the interest of Americans who are having to endure these price hikes that his administration investigate to make sure that there\'s not fraud involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there some sense that it just sort of dropped off the radar screen for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer for the details on their activity to the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei, I promised you -- yes.\xc2\xa0 And then Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 If I\'m not mistaken, the President has not reached out yet personally to President-elect Putin.\xc2\xa0 Does he intend to do so?\xc2\xa0 If not, is this sort of a signal -- should we read it as a signal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe they have spoken yet.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident they will speak.\xc2\xa0 I would not read anything into it beyond the busy schedules of two --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you guys even put a statement out congratulating -- the way you do for other world -- other leaders that get elected?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did we?\xc2\xa0 I think there was something from State.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Something from the White House --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There may have been.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I think I was -- I had at one point in -- I paraphrased a statement that I had from a previous briefing.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t remember if I delivered it or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But when State was making their statement -- I was there at the briefing -- they said that when the results of the elections are certified, there will be a different statement with names with proper congratulations coming from higher up.\xc2\xa0 You are the higher up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So when is that coming?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure about that.\xc2\xa0 But since you\'re referring to a State Department briefing I would refer you back to them on that.\xc2\xa0 I will certainly report out to you any conversation the President has with the new President of Russia when it happens.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Democrats in support of same-sex marriage are speaking more loudly on the issue.\xc2\xa0 Twenty-two U.S. senators have told me they support the idea of including a marriage equality plank in a Democratic Party platform.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday, Democratic National Convention Chair Antonio Villaraigosa also said he backs such language, saying, "I think it\'s basic to who we are."\xc2\xa0 By being in a state of evolution now on this issue for nearly 17 months, is the President deferring leadership in his own party?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, Chris, I can tell you that he is not engaged in the very early stages of what I understand to be the platform development, and I would refer you simply to discussions that the folks you mentioned are having.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s position hasn\'t changed.\xc2\xa0 I certainly have no new announcement to make on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by being in a state of evolution, I mean, the President is missing an opportunity to lead not just the Democratic Party but for the country as a whole.\xc2\xa0 So I --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have anything new to report to you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that -- can you identify what is obstructing the President from completing his evolution on this issue?\xc2\xa0 Is there some sort of fear of political backlash during an election year?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned something before about this process involving the President\'s faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, the last part of your question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned something about this process involving the President\'s faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, now, look, I would leave it to the President.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps he wasn\'t asked about this.\xc2\xa0 Maybe the next time he gives a press conference one of you can ask him about it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s entirely up to you if you want to be told, which you might be, that he doesn\'t have any news to make on it.\xc2\xa0 But -- (laughter) -- I really have no update for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question on this.\xc2\xa0 Marriage is going to be on the ballot and it\'s become -- it\'s going to be in the ballot for voters in as many as five states this year.\xc2\xa0 In North Carolina, that\'s going to happen -- for voters in May.\xc2\xa0 Will the President announce same-sex marriage before it\'s too late to help -- to start conversations that help gay and lesbian couples who are seeking to get married in these states?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a circuitous way of asking the same question, and I just don\'t have any updates for you on the President\'s position.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast one, yes, Peter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 At the time of the Shirley Sherrod case at the Agriculture Department, we were consistently told that there was no White House involvement.\xc2\xa0 Now the AP has, through a FOIA request, come up with emails that contradicts that.\xc2\xa0 Do you know where the disconnect was?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the disconnect is in the reporting by the Associated Press, which is inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 The emails confirm what we said at the time, which is that the White House had no involvement in the decision made regarding Ms. Sherrod\'s employment or her firing, but were made aware of the decision that had been made by the Department of Agriculture.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\'s nothing in those emails --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not in touch with the counsel at the Agriculture Department at the time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The issue is, was the White House involved in the decision made, and they were not.\xc2\xa0 The White House was not.\xc2\xa0 I was not in this position then, but we made clear at the time that there was discussion about the decision after it had been made, but not -- no involvement in the decision itself, which I think even the organization that made the FOIA request noted in its preamble, if you will.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- one-year anniversary of March 11th for Japan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:44 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
