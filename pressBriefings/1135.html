EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of interest in a readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with House Republicans, which I will provide to you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But first, if we could hold on that and questions about that, first I have with me today Ron Bloom.\xc2\xa0 He is Assistant to the President for Manufacturing Policy.\xc2\xa0 Many of you know him well.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s here to talk about a report issued today that we put out, which you should have by now, on the auto industry and where it stands now after the measures that were taken by the President two years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, without further ado I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Ron.\xc2\xa0 If you could -- while he\xe2\x80\x99s here, any questions you have regarding his report, regarding manufacturing, direct to him.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on you.\xc2\xa0 And then we can let him go, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, and we can deal with the other issues of the day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two years ago, General Motors filed for bankruptcy, and we thought this would be a good time to take stock of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened since then, the difficult decisions the President made in the run-up to that period, the assistance that we did determine to provide to the automobile industry, and what\xe2\x80\x99s happened since.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the President took office, we had an automobile industry in absolute freefall.\xc2\xa0 We had obviously an economy in great distress, but the automobile industry in some ways was falling faster than just about any other sector.\xc2\xa0 The President faced very difficult decisions about what to do to deal with this critical part of the American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The companies came forward very early, on February 17th of 2009, with plans that they believed justified additional taxpayer support; the President rejected those plans.\xc2\xa0 He told them they needed to act more aggressively.\xc2\xa0 They came back with much more robust plans that required substantial sacrifice from all their stakeholders.\xc2\xa0 And on June 1st, in the context of the General Motors bankruptcy, substantial additional assistance was provided to GM, and a month earlier assistance was provided to Chrysler.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since that time, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some really positive and encouraging signs, and we think that at this two-year anniversary it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to kind of take note and account of those things.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the last year, the Detroit Three have all gained market share, they have all added jobs, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve all shown the ability to make money.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re all making substantial profit.\xc2\xa0 Those three things together haven\xe2\x80\x99t been true of the Detroit Three in a long, long time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, the credit for that importantly goes to the men and women of those companies and their stakeholders, who all made very, very difficult decisions to come together.\xc2\xa0 But we think that it is also worth noting that the courageous decision the President made to stand behind these companies -- and this was not an easy call.\xc2\xa0 In particular I think Chrysler was in fact a difficult call.\xc2\xa0 Last year -- last week Chrysler repaid all of the loans that had been made to them, but at the time the President chose to help Chrysler, at the time he chose to help General Motors, a lot of people said, you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing good money after bad; you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get out; these companies are not savable.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President demonstrated both great political courage as well as great faith in the men and women who work at these companies and their stakeholders, and so far at least I think we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing very good signs of progress.\xc2\xa0 As I said, employment up -- the industry has gained 115,000 jobs in the last year, fastest job growth in a long, long time; gaining share; making money.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The road ahead for these is not easy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not simple.\xc2\xa0 They live in a difficult environment of global competition.\xc2\xa0 And so we by no means believe that their future is assured.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, we believe that the steps we took and the steps they took in partnership with us have positioned these companies to where they have a real chance of success.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s important because these companies are not just the three companies themselves, or the two companies themselves.\xc2\xa0 These companies, as the report documents, support a tremendous array of other businesses, workers, communities around them.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, the President is going to be going to Toledo.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be meeting with workers at a Chrysler assembly plant.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hearing from small businessmen and women in the community.\xc2\xa0 Because these manufacturing employers, very importantly -- and they\xe2\x80\x99re not the only ones who do this -- but very importantly, these manufacturing companies play a central role in their communities.\xc2\xa0 They are, if you will, oftentimes the anchor tenet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so manufacturing, which is today in fact leading our recovery -- 250,000 new jobs in manufacturing in the last year; faster GDP growth than the rest of the economy -- demonstrating that it can still play a very, very important role in the American economy.\xc2\xa0 So the automobile industry is a story of manufacturing, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a broader manufacturing story as well that we think needs to be brought to attention.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s what the report is about.\xc2\xa0 Happy to answer questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay, and thanks, Ron.\xc2\xa0 You said that we by no believe that their future is assured.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say at this point that the -- that their survival is assured?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything in life is assured.\xc2\xa0 The fate of these companies rests with the men and women who work there, the managers, the boards of directors, and many things in the external environment.\xc2\xa0 When we made these investments, people said you will never get out of the car business.\xc2\xa0 We are exiting, as we said we would, as soon as practical.\xc2\xa0 We have now had all our money paid back from General Motors -- sorry, from Chrysler; we\xe2\x80\x99ve cut our stake in GM in half; and we have a small residual stake in Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 We are pulling back from these companies, and so I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any prediction about their ultimate fate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What I will say is we believe that as they sit today, making the kind of cars Americans want to buy, making better cars, making more fuel-efficient cars, being able to be vigorous competitors in the marketplace, gaining market share, tells me that they have an opportunity to succeed.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not they succeed will be up to them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What money do we still -- do taxpayers still have invested in these companies?\xc2\xa0 And at what point will that be repaid, if ever?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 The total funds invested, including the prior administration, into the industry is roughly $80 billion.\xc2\xa0 Roughly $40 billion has been returned to date.\xc2\xa0 The remaining money is accounted for by stakes in General Motors -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve sold about half of what we own, but we still own the other half -- a small equity stake in Chrysler; and a stake in Ally Financial, which is the old General Motors Acceptance Corporation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How those stakes are realized is not yet determined.\xc2\xa0 We are -- as we have said repeatedly, we are determined to exit those stakes as soon as practical.\xc2\xa0 And so what they fetch in the market will determine the full accounting of the remainder of the money.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to translate that -- the moment that they\xe2\x80\x99re worth what we paid for in terms of stock, equity, that\xe2\x80\x99s when we will then sell it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have a particular target price, because the President has made clear that he does not believe that it is the proper role of government in the long term to be an owner of a private corporation.\xc2\xa0 And so we do not view ourselves as kind of market timing, looking for the absolute best opportunity to sell.\xc2\xa0 So we have tried to walk a fine line.\xc2\xa0 We said we\xe2\x80\x99re not selling as soon as possible, meaning we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sell at a fire sale the first day we can.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, we\xe2\x80\x99re not holding, waiting for a target price.\xc2\xa0 So we will look to exit these things as soon as practical, and the price that they fetch in the market will be the price that they fetch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We report periodically, and other oversight agencies report periodically, looking at the value of those stakes.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed out, the loss, if you will, that\xe2\x80\x99s been reported -- that had been reported early, has come down substantially.\xc2\xa0 The latest number from the CBO I think was a $14 billion loss, and that reflects market prices at the time they did it.\xc2\xa0 The final number will be the final number.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And look, there is no joy in having to announce -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not announcing anything today -- but in recognizing that all of this money will not be returned.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, as we record what was lost, we need to also record what was saved.\xc2\xa0 External experts have stated that over a million jobs were saved by the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions, and other people have numbers substantially higher than that.\xc2\xa0 The impact of the collapse of GM and Chrysler would not have been just the couple hundred thousand people who worked at these companies.\xc2\xa0 Three times as many people worked in the supply base.\xc2\xa0 Another three times as many worked in the suppliers, to say nothing of all the pizza parlors and all the dry cleaners and all the other people in these communities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So while we are obviously extremely conscious of our obligation to get every penny we can for the taxpayer, we\xe2\x80\x99re also not going to apologize for the fact that there are literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working today for what -- because of what happened, and that the -- when the final accounting occurs, we\xe2\x80\x99re quite confident it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a far smaller number than people predicted at the time we did it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?\xc2\xa0 On the $14 billion, where does that number come from?\xc2\xa0 Is that your number?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree that that\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable number?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable number, and we do our own.\xc2\xa0 And then the Treasury Department does their own accounting.\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no attempt to not be transparent.\xc2\xa0 You can look at what General Motors shares are trading for.\xc2\xa0 You know how many we have.\xc2\xa0 The other numbers are available.\xc2\xa0 So again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no view that this is not an important number to track and to acknowledge.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, as I said, I think there are two sides to this story.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can do to get that 14 down to zero?\xc2\xa0 Or you just --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Look, the stock market will do what it does.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.\xc2\xa0 If we were a 100 percent private investor, we might consider taking certain kinds of steps to particularly enhance the value of these companies.\xc2\xa0 But the President made a very conscious decision:\xc2\xa0 We do not manage these companies.\xc2\xa0 We put an extraordinary group of men and women -- we did put them in as the initial board of directors, and then we have stepped back.\xc2\xa0 So, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate there would be any particular action we would take.\xc2\xa0 We will sell as soon as practical, but I do not think -- in fact, I think you should not expect that we will make any kind of intervention.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable that the decision the President made, while very difficult at the time, was, in fact, the right decision.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable that our commitment to sell as soon as practical is a good decision, and the final accounting will be what it is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify those numbers real quick?\xc2\xa0 You said the $14 billion -- that comes from CBO.\xc2\xa0 And then you guys use the overall $80 billion as a total.\xc2\xa0 But CBO uses $85 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a $5 billion on a supplier support program, which went in and out.\xc2\xa0 So that we\xe2\x80\x99ve returned all of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 And then in terms of market share, how much of the increase of market share had to do with, A, supply disruptions from the earthquake, and then prior to that the Toyota braking scandal?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how much of this is positive as opposed to negative?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 The recent problems in Japan are quite recent, and so the gains in market share come before that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Toyota had some challenges last year, but that does not explain the entire gain in share of the Big Three.\xc2\xa0 Look, the Big Three are making better cars and they\xe2\x80\x99re making better, fuel-efficient cars.\xc2\xa0 The Chevy Cruze is selling off the lot.\xc2\xa0 The Ford Focus is a big seller.\xc2\xa0 The Volt is the car of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So obviously there are up and down numbers, and obviously some of the competitors have faced challenges.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that these three companies -- Chrysler has gained market share, retail market share, 13 straight months.\xc2\xa0 So I think all of these companies are moving forward in a positive way based on their own performance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you look at the three individual market shares, is it one lagging as opposed to others?\xc2\xa0 It seems like Chrysler hasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved as much as --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Actually, Chrysler\xe2\x80\x99s retail share has actually gone up quite a bit in the last year.\xc2\xa0 So, no, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s little puts and takes all over, but all three of them have gained share.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I realize that the government, the administration, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have a long-term position in these companies, in a private company, but why not have a timed strategy of exiting at the top of the market, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a bigger investment?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s prudent investment strategy for the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 money.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 If you know when the top of the market is, you and I should have a conversation in the other room.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily the top -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily timing it at the top of the market, but you watch it as it -- the trends --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 No, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an important point.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Nobody -- I mean, the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you follow trends.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 We do, and lots and lots of people in America think they know when the top of the market is.\xc2\xa0 The decisions --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The weak spot of the market, not necessarily the top of the market.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is.\xc2\xa0 I wish I did.\xc2\xa0 And again, if you can tell me, I really do want to know, because I can stop having to do this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But look -- but I want to make --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stockbrokers do it all the time.\xc2\xa0 You sell when you think it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 And some are right and some are wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some are right, exactly.\xc2\xa0 But what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no strategy for that at all, you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to sell whenever you want to sell.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 No, there\xe2\x80\x99s not, but here\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say we would sell whenever we wanted to sell.\xc2\xa0 What I said was we would responsibly sell as soon as practical.\xc2\xa0 That does not mean as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 Obviously tomorrow morning we could sell it all if we wanted.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen not to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we have to be very careful here.\xc2\xa0 The President made an extraordinary decision to intervene in the private economy.\xc2\xa0 It was justified by the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 That is not the normal way that a government ought to behave toward private actors.\xc2\xa0 And the longer you stay in, the longer you stay in, the more you signal to the market that the government intends to be in the business of owning companies.\xc2\xa0 That is not a business the President wants to be in.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s said many, many times, I did not run for office to be CEO of an automobile company.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So while it is hugely tempting to take the knowledge that we have -- and again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to think we\xe2\x80\x99re smarter than anybody else about this -- but to take the knowledge we have and say, oh, if we just waited a little longer, a little longer, a little longer -- the problem is, you start that, and then all of a sudden you wake up two, three, four, five years from now and you still own a big stake in a private company.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think our decision -- which we set up long ago.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think the most important thing you need to do in situations like this with markets is be transparent.\xc2\xa0 So we told people what we were going to do.\xc2\xa0 We said we will sell as soon as practical.\xc2\xa0 Now, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t say we\xe2\x80\x99re selling on May 17th, but we gave a clear signal that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be long-term investors.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the success of the General Motors IPO, which at the time, if you remember, was the largest IPO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, one of the reasons that $23 billion of private capital showed up on that day back last fall was because they knew we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to market time, that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in being a long-term investor because I think if they had believed that, they would have been more cautious about becoming shareholders with us.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I agree with you, it is tempting.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a keen appreciation of the obligation to be stewards to the taxpayer, but we have a broader obligation to play a constructive role in the overall economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think those two things have to be balanced.\xc2\xa0 And the way we have balanced them -- and we said this two years ago, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been extremely true to it -- is to sell as soon as practical.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, again, what is quite encouraging is that the companies are producing -- it\xe2\x80\x99s always true that when gas prices go up, people start buying smaller cars.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s been true in every rise in gas prices in the last 30 years.\xc2\xa0 The difference is that over the -- most of the last 30 years, that activity meant the D3 lost share, because they did not have competitive smaller cars.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so the fact that every time gas prices went up, it was -- they were obviously in secular decline in share, but it accentuated their share loss.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now what you have is in the case of GM and Ford, most assuredly, and Chrysler coming behind, particularly with the new Fiat technologies, all three of these companies are going to be able to offer Americans fuel-efficient cars.\xc2\xa0 So the Cruze is selling off the lot; the Focus is doing well; the Volt is a big hit.\xc2\xa0 So obviously nobody roots for high gas prices, but the reality is that the D3 in particular are able to address consumer demand in that context.\xc2\xa0 And that I think is a very positive development.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

BLOOM:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it is worth noting that the index has 22 straight months of increase.\xc2\xa0 As I pointed out earlier, 250,000 jobs in manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 The recent month was obviously down a bit from the prior.\xc2\xa0 It was still a growth month.\xc2\xa0 As you know, indicators above 50 indicate growth, and so we still saw growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think that most of that growth -- most of that slowdown in growth is attributed to the situation in Japan because the way global supply chains work, you can\xe2\x80\x99t finish a part if you can\xe2\x80\x99t get the part.\xc2\xa0 And so I think it is largely external factors.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Look, the long-term trend on manufacturing since the bottom of the recession is quite positive, and I think we remain optimistic that manufacturing has a good future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting in that regard in the last year there is a very different attitude both in the corporate sector, as well as in a lot of the academic and other people who follow manufacturing about the future of manufacturing in America.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You are now seeing sophisticated analysts\xe2\x80\x99 reports talking about America as a very competitive place to manufacture.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re seeing corporations talk about insourcing in a way they haven\xe2\x80\x99t before.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So while I absolutely would expect month-to-month variations, I do think that we are in a good place.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not where we want to be yet.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously still a huge distance to go.\xc2\xa0 But I think the trends in manufacturing remain good.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did that happen?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two points.\xc2\xa0 One, this is a large meeting and this was not the forum for specific advances in the negotiations that have been conducted by the Vice President with members of both parties and both houses.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And yet it was productive for the reason that I think I mentioned before and that the conference chairman mentioned, which is that it is always good in Washington, in this day and age, when Republicans and Democrats sit down and listen to each other in a constructive environment, a non-confrontational environment.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously there are long-term disagreements between Republicans and Democrats, between this President and Republicans, on the ideas about how we should address our long-term deficit problems and debt problems.\xc2\xa0 And those -- all of those disagreements will not be resolved in the next several weeks as these negotiations move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there is common ground, and more common ground can be found to significantly reduce our deficits.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that with both sides negotiating in good faith, that a compromise can be achieved, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, again, I think this is part of a process that\xe2\x80\x99s very productive and helps reduce I think some of the confrontational atmosphere that surrounds some of these discussions.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree on some fundamental issues.\xc2\xa0 Of course we do.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t papered over our differences, and neither have they.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I think the American people understand that we have differences and yet they still expect us to get things done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand the point about reducing the temperature, the value of that, but do you think a discussion like this actually helps the two sides get any closer on those substantive differences?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it helps in that it allows everyone in the room to look each other in the eye as one member makes a case for the Republican position and the President answers questions, to understand that each side holds very strong opinions about certain issues, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of overlap in terms of what the goals are here, and that there\xe2\x80\x99s overlap in terms of what some of the solutions are.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes you miss that when you only hear the monologue that passes as a dialogue when each side is talking to each other through the press.\xc2\xa0 So the President feels very strongly that this was a useful thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 Representative Ryan said he made the case in his terms for his Medicare plan, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the President to be mis-describing it -- as I believe he put it -- is that what the President thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s doing?\xc2\xa0 Is he mis-describing his plan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And look, as I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there are differences.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that on the issue of Medicare, we have significant differences.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has made clear is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we need to end Medicare as we know it, to dismantle the program as it currently exists, in order to achieve significant deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He believes that Congressman Ryan as the author of the plan and the members who voted for it are sincere in believing that they think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- that that is a preferred solution.\xc2\xa0 We simply disagree.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of demagoguery, it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of fundamental differences of opinion and a different assessment of the facts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we think the facts in this case are on our side.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons is that -- the problems we have with it is that in order to achieve the reductions that they seek in the House Republican plan, and to pay for the extensive tax cuts for the wealthy that that plan calls for, they need to do things to Medicare that aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessary.\xc2\xa0 And it produces an unbalanced plan, puts too much of the burden of deficit reduction on the shoulders of seniors, of low-income children and the disabled.\xc2\xa0 And the President just feels that that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What specifically did the President tell the Republicans about the debt limit?\xc2\xa0 And Republicans who came out of meetings said it was discussed at the beginning of the meeting; it didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily take up a lot of time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s accurate.\xc2\xa0 It did not take up much time at all.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that he believes that there is no margin here for in any way casting doubt on the possibility that the debt ceiling would be raised, that the effect of even suggesting that it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen could be highly negative and could have dire consequences for our economy and the global economy.\xc2\xa0 But it is accurate to say that that was not a focus of the discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I understand that Secretary Geithner was in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he said anything -- at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what I heard.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that -- I know he was in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is the President did most of the talking for the White House, for the administration.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Geithner is going to Capitol Hill tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Does that indicate that you\xe2\x80\x99re worried the message isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting across to Republicans about the debt limit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it indicates how seriously we take this issue, and that the Treasury Secretary in particular can address the particulars and the substance of why it is so essential to raise the debt ceiling, the consequences of not doing it, and the impact it would have on global markets, on interest rates, on economic growth and job creation. So I think that we -- as I do consistently from here and others do from other venues -- need to simply reiterate the absolute necessity of making that vote and raising the debt ceiling so that we do not reverse the very important and substantial progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made since we emerged from the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A number of Republicans, though, argue they\xe2\x80\x99re not unwilling to raise the debt limit, they agree that it needs to be raised, but that there needs to be an agreement on how to cut the debt.\xc2\xa0 And they think it\xe2\x80\x99s unhelpful for the administration to keep saying it would be calamitous, that it would be better to focus on the cuts and how to get the debt down.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing both.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on this is very clear.\xc2\xa0 Not only did he lay out his plan and his vision for how to achieve $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 to 12 years, he then tasked the Vice President of the United States to lead these very serious and so far productive negotiations with Congress -- with both parties in both houses -- to achieve a compromise on significant deficit reduction, within the same timeframe that we need to address the vote on raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I think that demonstrates his commitment to both necessities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What we have said all along is that it sends the wrong signal and it would be a mistake to directly link, tie, or hold hostage one to the other because of the absolute necessity of raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 It is not an option if you want to maintain full faith and credit of the United States and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to send this economy back into recession.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Ryan, in the meeting today, according to attendees and according to Ryan at the stakeout camera, made the point to the President that, as Ben mentioned, that demagogueing the Ryan plan for Medicare is not helpful to this process.\xc2\xa0 And while I understand the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he has done so, does he think that the Democratic Party has done so?\xc2\xa0 Has he seen the ads showing a Paul Ryan look-a-like pushing grandma off a cliff?\xc2\xa0 Has he seen any of these ways Democrats are using the Ryan plan to win elections and score political points, and does he have any issue with that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what ads he may or may not have seen, Jake.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that the substantive differences over Medicare are real.\xc2\xa0 And the facts about whatever you call the system that is in the House Republican proposal -- premium support or privatization or voucherization of the program -- it has the impact of shifting the cost burden for ever-growing medical costs onto beneficiaries in large, large numbers -- $6,400 per senior.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just an inescapable fact.\xc2\xa0 And our argument is, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do that.\xc2\xa0 You can find savings in Medicare and entitlements, as the President has already through the Affordable Care Act, and as he has proposed further in his future-oriented proposal.\xc2\xa0 And you can get at waste, fraud, and abuse, and you can reduce the cost of medical care while still protecting our seniors.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he believes we have to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And one of the fundamental problems -- and I think why people around the country have reacted poorly to the Republican proposal -- is that it not only eliminates or changes the Medicare program to the point where it is no longer the program we know and does not provide the guarantees that it used to, but it does so, in part, in order to fund tax cuts for wealthy Americans who have already benefited significantly at a time when the middle class and others have been squeezed so tightly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So those are just -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an assessment of priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you seen grandma going over the cliff, Jay?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that -- I understand that there is a philosophical -- legitimate, philosophical difference the President has.\xc2\xa0 Is it --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President fundamentally believes that it does not -- that we need a bipartisan solution, that we need to work together and find common ground.\xc2\xa0 And --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does his party running ads showing Paul Ryan pushing grandma over a cliff help that bipartisan process?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the decisions and the negotiations that will produce a result and demonstrate this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to significant deficit reduction, as well as Democrats in Congress and Republicans in Congress, occur in the -- occur here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, is that we can achieve that in a way that the American people can feel that each side moved off its starting position, accepted that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to get 100 percent of what it wanted, that no absolutist positions prevail in Washington -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of our system.\xc2\xa0 And he feels that he has demonstrated his commitment to that, his commitment to taking positions that often are at odds with members of his own party repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been willing to do that in the past and he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to do that in the future, because he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to finding solutions that work for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So should the Democratic Party stop running those ads?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered that question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t answered the question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the President is conducting himself in an appropriate way, but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t addressed the question of whether or not his party is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me if there\xe2\x80\x99s been a negative reaction to aspects of the Republican plan, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the incontrovertible facts about what\xe2\x80\x99s in the plan.\xc2\xa0 And our opposition to those elements of the House Republican proposal have, we have not at all papered over.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing -- we are interested in bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 This President has made that clear again and again, and he\xe2\x80\x99s walked the walk, not just talked the talk, when it comes to making those tough choices, and he\xe2\x80\x99s shown his willingness to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question about Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but then let\xe2\x80\x99s move on so that others --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick, let me just -- the question is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a resolution being offered by Congressman Dennis Kucinich that would stop U.S. military intervention in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And there are House Democrat and House Republican leaders who are concerned that it actually could pass because there are enough House Republicans who are frustrated with the consultation process and with what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of this?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House doing anything about it?\xc2\xa0 Is it concerned?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware of what happens on Capitol Hill and are aware of this in particular.\xc2\xa0 But as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, we feel strongly that the President has acted in a way that is consistent with the War Powers resolution.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to and would be happy with support, demonstrations of support by Congress and -- similar to the Kerry-McCain proposal that has been put forward.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait to see whatever action Congress takes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the meantime, we are -- we welcome the announcement today by NATO that it will extend its mission in Libya for 90 days.\xc2\xa0 We feel that mission has been successful thus far and -- in protecting -- in its mandate of protecting Libyans from attacks by the Qaddafi regime.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to participate in that mission.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to go back to the tone of the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 Was it at times confrontational?\xc2\xa0 Were there sharp exchanges?\xc2\xa0 And were Republicans challenging the President directly?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it was a very frank discussion, Dan, but I would not say it was confrontational.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think it was productive, and while nobody hid from the fact that there are differences, that it was a useful conversation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what I heard when I watched some of the Republican members go out to the stakeout after the meeting, and we agree with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we don\xe2\x80\x99t have differences, but it means that we can as -- or they can as elected officials sent here by their constituents to represent them in Washington -- can have conversations.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re Republicans, they can have conversations with Democrats, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re Democrats, they can have conversations with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And out of that dialogue comes agreement -- not on every issue, but on a substantial areas -- on substantial areas that can allow us to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people expect out of us.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And beyond the fact that everyone was quite pleased that all sides are sitting down and talking, that there is this dialogue, was there any real movement beyond the starting point, as you pointed out?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- I think I was asked this before -- this was not the forum, with that many people in the room, to put out proposals and spreadsheets and start negotiating details.\xc2\xa0 That is happening in the negotiations led by the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 But it was an excellent opportunity for the President to hear from House Republicans and for the House Republicans to hear from the President.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a useful exercise almost on any occasion, but in particular on this occasion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, House Speaker Boehner, as a matter of principle, has said that the cuts that are agreed to ought to be at least as big as the cut -- as the raising of the debt limit.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- just as a matter of pure principle, is that something the White House can go along with?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have a reaction to that as a matter of principle.\xc2\xa0 I think that the details of the size of a deficit-reduction package are being worked out by the bipartisan group that is meeting with the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And then the -- I think the Treasury Secretary is our lead on what we think the debt ceiling vote should look like and the size of it, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- and we think they are distinct and separate issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any principle from the White House that that would violate, right?\xc2\xa0 So just a question of where you fit --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we think they are -- we understand that there is linkage in the sense that some members have insisted that there be deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We agree with the sentiment that we need to seriously attack our deficits, but we also think it\xe2\x80\x99s an absolute necessity to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And we -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to hear us link them in that way because we think they should not be linked directly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe that we can take action -- positive action on both within the same time period, but again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to link them directly in that way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chip.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How hard did the President push on the need for revenues as part of this package?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President made clear what his positions are, as he did in his speech at George Washington University and as he has repeatedly since then, and as other members of his team have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be agreement on everything.\xc2\xa0 There will be disputes on budget matters between Democrats and Republicans next year and the year after and probably the year after that.\xc2\xa0 I can guarantee that.\xc2\xa0 But there is room for compromise on a number of areas that will allow us to reduce the deficit significantly and move this process forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the end, will revenues be part of this deal?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we obviously feel strongly that you need to take a balanced approach if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to come up with significant -- in our proposal -- $4 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 to 12 years.\xc2\xa0 That would have to include addressing spending in the tax code.\xc2\xa0 It would have to include the issues the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0 But we --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he draw a line in the sand --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But we understand -- we understand --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on revenues?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, there were no lines drawn in the sand and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even on revenues?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There were no lines drawn in the sand.\xc2\xa0 The process for negotiating the particulars takes place in the conversations being led by the Vice President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our position is well known; the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is well known.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Republicans -- some of them, anyway -- have made their position well known in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s on the table.\xc2\xa0 What stays on the table depends on the progress being made in those negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to this letter that Speaker Boehner produced, signed by more than 150 economists, calling for spending cuts that exceed the debt limit increase?\xc2\xa0 You touched on it a little bit, but the specific letter, any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a -- these are two important goals that need to be achieved.\xc2\xa0 One is significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We agree with Republicans and Democrats that that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President put forward a plan that has $4 trillion in reductions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he asked the Vice President to lead these negotiations, which have been, we feel, productive thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s an absolute necessity that the debt ceiling be raised and he -- you know, I can pull out letters also and read one yesterday from President Reagan to the Senate Majority Leader.\xc2\xa0 There is a vast array of evidence and a vast number of experts who can testify to the fact that playing chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States government is a bad idea.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that is certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the next meeting is scheduled for June 9th.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- the clock is ticking.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys feel like maybe you need to move the timetable up a little, have more frequent meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you can be sure that the conversations don\xe2\x80\x99t stop just because there aren\xe2\x80\x99t the formal meetings between the participants, and the conversations continue regularly between staff and also sometimes between participants.\xc2\xa0 So that is simply the next full meeting of the group of negotiators.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are obviously very aware of the need to move quickly, and I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved quite aggressively on this, working with members of Congress and their schedule to make these meetings happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 You said today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting was not confrontational.\xc2\xa0 We heard that at least one of the members challenged the President to lead on this issue.\xc2\xa0 Does that bother the President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard before and I think the President has clearly led in this.\xc2\xa0 He established the fiscal Bowles commission -- the fiscal commission -- I mean, the Simpson-Bowles commission, the fiscal commission that, because Congress would not, he established.\xc2\xa0 And those recommendations helped guide him as he drew up his proposal that he put forward in the speech at GW.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He demonstrated his willingness to accept spending cuts that were not ideal from his perspective, but were necessary in order to achieve the agreement that he reached with Republicans to fully fund fiscal year 2011.\xc2\xa0 And he demonstrated by appointing the Vice President to lead these talks that he is very serious about leading this process to a conclusion that produces serious deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he offer anything new on Medicare himself, or does he plan to?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 He did not offer any new proposals today.\xc2\xa0 His proposal is out there and I think pretty extensive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Medicare is on the table in these negotiations?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what is on the table is serious deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, Mike, had reductions -- had savings out of entitlements, including health care entitlements, in the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 He had savings, additional savings, out of entitlements in his vision for future deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our beef, if you will, with the Republican proposal is not that you can\xe2\x80\x99t find some savings.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s that you do not have to undermine the fundamental guarantee of Medicare, undermine the Medicare program, essentially end it as we know it, in order to get substantial savings, in part to pay for a tax cut for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 We just don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right arrangement of priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no linkage and there\xe2\x80\x99s no grand bargain, but how soon does the President believe that Medicare needs to be reformed?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the life expectancy of Medicare, if you will, was recently downgraded by six years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting, I assume, that there was significant Medicare reforms in the Affordable Care Act, and in fact --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I know, but even given that, after --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the only aspects of the Affordable Care Act that Congressman Ryan in his plan retained -- not the protections it offered, but were the savings in Medicare and Medicaid that are put forward in that.\xc2\xa0 So -- and again, the President has put forward other reforms.\xc2\xa0 We believe in making a stronger -- making sure that guarantee exists for seniors in the future, and that involves some reform and finding of savings.\xc2\xa0 But it does not involve ending the program as we know it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, Secretary Geithner has said, and I think you have said or other administration officials have said, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been assured by Republican leaders in the past that there would be a debt ceiling -- the debt ceiling would be raised.\xc2\xa0 Did the Speaker reiterate that assurance today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for the Speaker, but my understanding is the President addressed this issue.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there was a further conversation.\xc2\xa0 It is true, as mentioned earlier, that it was not much of a topic of today\xe2\x80\x99s conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the vote yesterday in the House, do you believe that that assurance in still operative?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe that the leaders in Congress of both parties understand fully that it would be extremely dangerous and would have highly negative impacts on our economy if we were not to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we believe Congress will act, and we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that no one cast doubt on the -- or create doubt about the possibility that Congress will act.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Carol.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman McCarthy said he wanted something more specific from the President on deficit reduction that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President intends to do?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President put forth I think a robust and comprehensive proposal in his speech at George Washington University.\xc2\xa0 I think we are now in a situation where in the negotiations being led by the Vice President, they are getting into specifics, and we do not need another proposal out there.\xc2\xa0 Our ideas, their ideas, ideas of others are known and out there and available for discussion in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I think slowing down the process is not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just more broadly on the economy, I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the housing market is struggling again.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the manufacturing numbers and other indicators that the recovery is not going as well as maybe it was.\xc2\xa0 Has that had any impact on the deficit talks that the Vice President is holding?\xc2\xa0 Does it make the President rethink, perhaps, spending cuts or his position on tax increases?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we addressed this a little bit yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Obviously everyone is there, we believe, in these negotiations, because the end goal here is a stronger economy and greater job creation.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that we should do nothing in these talks that undermines some of the foundation that we have to have in order to grow in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he feels very strongly we need to protect investments in education, research and development, and infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also true that he believes that we need to reduce our deficit, we need to get our fiscal house in order as an economic imperative.\xc2\xa0 But you need to do it in a balanced way, so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t upset the recovery that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been undergoing and you don\xe2\x80\x99t put a halt to the kind of growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously still in a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99re emerging from the worst recession since the Great Depression, where there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of positive indicators, including the substantial private sector job growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, including the sustained period of economic growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, but we have a lot more distance to travel before we get to where we need to be.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so I think all of this is about making sure that we ensure growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 None of these things have given him any -- have caused him to rethink about the way that he\xe2\x80\x99s approaching this?\xc2\xa0 Or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, because I think his approach has always been driven in part by a concern that we not do anything that would reverse the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President, in fact, reference that Reagan letter in the meeting today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he compare himself to Reagan?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what some of the members are saying.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question -- another question on the meeting, do you feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s any breach of the closed nature of this meeting for a congressman to sit in there and send out a constant stream of twit pics of the meeting while it\xe2\x80\x99s in progress?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously closed it to the press because we felt that would be more conducive to having a useful conversation.\xc2\xa0 We feel that it was a useful conversation.\xc2\xa0 What individual members did is obviously up to them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother you that Issa did that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re glad you\xe2\x80\x99re fine.\xc2\xa0 Is the President fine with it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Congressman Ryan.\xc2\xa0 Will the President stop calling his plan a voucher plan for Medicare?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, what you call it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change what it does and what it is.\xc2\xa0 It is a voucher plan.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re basically giving a subsidy of a set dollar figure that\xe2\x80\x99s limited in terms of its growth and that won\xe2\x80\x99t stay up with the growth in medical costs, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- you\xe2\x80\x99re basically getting a certain amount of money to put towards buying insurance.\xc2\xa0 They may not get a voucher in the mail, but that is what it is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And -- but the issue isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you call it, it\xe2\x80\x99s the impact that it would have on seniors, an impact that we think is unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 Not only is it the wrong thing to do, we think, because it\xe2\x80\x99s important to maintain that guarantee that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided for seniors since Medicare was created, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also unnecessary because it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the cuts are so deep in part because the need to restructure that program and to end its guarantee that it used to have is driven by the need to fund these tax cuts that we don\xe2\x80\x99t think are necessary, especially when we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it just defies logic as far as we see it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mara.\xc2\xa0 Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You keep on saying there\xe2\x80\x99s been common ground and there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of overlap, but listening to the House Republicans reiterate their basic positions -- no tax increases, substantial cuts in Medicare, $2 trillion in cuts over 10 years -- can you give us any specific examples of common ground that\xe2\x80\x99s been found so far?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the negotiations the Vice President has been leading continue.\xc2\xa0 We have another meeting scheduled.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been productive and I think the participants in those meetings feel that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been productive and useful, and that they are leading to an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And it would not -- it is not useful to the hope of having an outcome that\xe2\x80\x99s positive to give it a play-by-play as they\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, again, this was not a forum for negotiating those details.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about the Biden talks, not so much this meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I guess my question is, I understand why it\xe2\x80\x99s in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s interests to not spook the markets and make the markets think that you\xe2\x80\x99re moving toward an agreement, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that that would spook the markets, would it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To say that those talks are falling apart?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I -- first of all, they\xe2\x80\x99re not, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, other than the need to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re productive, you can\xe2\x80\x99t point to any specific example of how they\xe2\x80\x99re productive?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to negotiate in public, but it just seems that there\xe2\x80\x99s no sign of overlap.\xc2\xa0 You keep on saying there is, but --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, again, the sign of overlap is that there -- we share the same goal, roughly $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years.\xc2\xa0 Backing up, we have identified the problem and agree on what the problem is -- the need to reduce our deficits and our debt and on the broad goal of what the solution is, $4 trillion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In getting to that $4 trillion, there are -- there is common ground -- maybe not all of it.\xc2\xa0 As I said, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt in my mind and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure no doubt in yours that Republicans and Democrats will continue to disagree and have disagreements on substantive issues about budgeting and the economy for years to come.\xc2\xa0 But there is enough common ground, especially if each side is willing to move off its starting position, to achieve significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- you can be skeptical about it, as people were skeptical about the potential for compromise in December and skeptical about the potential for compromise during the CR discussions.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that there will be a positive outcome if you\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic about it, but we think there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to be optimistic not just because we\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic by nature but because we feel that the negotiations have been productive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other question about the Medicare controversy.\xc2\xa0 The President has reportedly said the demagoguery comes from both sides.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s referencing the 2010 campaign when Republicans accused you of cutting Medicare.\xc2\xa0 Now you guys are doing the same thing to them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a back-and-forth about who said what and who said this and that, but I will say that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s view?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a general statement of fact that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That both sides are demagogueing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- politics can get --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledging that both sides are demagogueing --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on what he may or may not have said in terms of the dialogue in each sense.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to trying to find common ground; that there is no way to get a solution that\xe2\x80\x99s not a bipartisan solution, and so that requires an atmosphere where Republicans and Democrats who are in the room negotiating have a certain level of trust.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Brennan has gone to Sudan and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his assessment of the situation in Sudan and what progress do you believe was made there?\xc2\xa0 And how urgent is the situation between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia?\xc2\xa0 What do you hope will be accomplished in those meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, you\xe2\x80\x99re right that he\xe2\x80\x99s making these trips.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made our views known on Sudan and our concern about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there very clear.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Brennan is there to assess the situation there.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of -- Saudi Arabia is an important partner and we are in regular contact at a variety of levels with the Saudi government, and I think that this is just part of that sort of continued contact.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more from Jackie.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separate from all the talk about the long-term budget cutting, Mr. Cantor indicated there was talk that the Republicans are opposed to any sort of further stimulus for the economy.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s response to that, given that we have job numbers coming out this week, unemployment is at the highest level since the Depression?\xc2\xa0 What does he feel about the current economy and going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President feels, as you know, that we need to further the growth in the economy and the growth in job creation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past several months and quarters.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he say to them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific readout in terms of -- because this discussion wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about stimulus.\xc2\xa0 It was about the overall economy and specifically about deficit and debt reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President feels that we need to make -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned before, precisely for the reasons that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned -- we need to continue to make key investments to undergird our economy that allow us to grow in those sectors that are so vital to sort of future competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 And he made that point very clearly today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the quote from Cantor was, \xe2\x80\x9cThe discussion really focused on the philosophical difference on whether Washington should continue to pump money into the economy or we should provide an incentive for entrepreneurs and small businesses to grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The President talked about a need for us to continue to \xe2\x80\x98invest\xe2\x80\x99 from Washington\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint.\xc2\xa0 And for a lot of us, that\xe2\x80\x99s code for more Washington spending.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the investments that the President was referring to are the investments I just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of encouraging private sector job creation, I would note the rather strong private sector job creation we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recently, including 750,000 over three months.\xc2\xa0 The President has taken dramatic action -- 17 I think, or maybe more, small business tax cuts designed specifically for that purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the Republicans also talked a lot about regulation, and I think those of you who were here last week saw the significant action that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, charging agencies to review all the regulations under their control to find ones that are no longer efficient, are overly burdensome, and to report out on those so that they can be changed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a very aggressive approach to reducing or eliminating the regulations that are no longer necessary that in any way impede economic growth.\xc2\xa0 So I think we agree on the need to create jobs and to grow the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 1:54 P.M.
