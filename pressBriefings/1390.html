EDT</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 This is a good day for America and our security.\xc2\xa0 And as President Obama just reiterated, it is one of the highest priorities of the Obama administration to pursue an agenda to reduce the threat posed by the deadliest weapons the world has ever known.\xc2\xa0 President Obama set that forth in his speech at Prague last year.\xc2\xa0 And today, he and President Medvedev reached an agreement to make significant and verifiable reductions in our nuclear arsenals.</p>\n<p>Long after the Cold War\xe2\x80\x99s end, the United States and Russia still possess more than 90 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 We do not need such large arsenals to protect our nation and our allies against the two greatest dangers we face today:\xc2\xa0 nuclear proliferation and terrorism.</p>\n<p>This treaty represents a significant step forward in our cooperation with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We were committed from the beginning to reset the U.S.-Russia relationship, because we saw it as essential to making progress on our top priorities -- from counterterrorism, to nuclear security and non-proliferation.</p>\n<p>Now, we will continue to have disagreements with our Russian friends.\xc2\xa0 But this treaty is an example of deep and substantive cooperation on a matter of vital importance.\xc2\xa0 And more broadly, it shows that patient, principled diplomacy can advance our national interests by producing real results, in this case results that are good for us, good for Russia, and good for global security and stability.</p>\n<p>The treaty also shows the world -- particularly states like Iran and North Korea -- that one of our top priorities is to strengthen the global non-proliferation regime and keep nuclear materials out of the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0 The new START treaty demonstrates our commitment to making progress toward disarmament under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the so-called NPT.</p>\n<p>So as we uphold our commitments and strengthen the NPT, we can hold others accountable to do the same.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen will say more about the details of the treaty, but I want to make clear that we have adhered to the Russian proverb that President Reagan frequently employed, \xe2\x80\x9ctrust, but verify.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Verification provides the transparency and builds the trust needed to reduce the chance for misunderstandings and miscalculations.</p>\n<p>President Obama insisted on a whole of government effort to reach this result, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what this was.\xc2\xa0 He and President Medvedev met several times and spoke often by phone.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, General Jones worked closely with their Russian counterparts.\xc2\xa0 Foreign Minister Lavrov and I met in person, most recently last week in Moscow, and we spoke on the phone too many times to count.\xc2\xa0 Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller worked tirelessly in Geneva for many months as our chief negotiator.\xc2\xa0 Under Secretary Ellen Tauscher, who is here with us, joined her at a crucial time to help complete the agreement, assisted very ably by our State Department expert team, including Jim Timbie.\xc2\xa0 Teams of people at the State Department, the White House, DOD, elsewhere worked tirelessly to make this happen.</p>\n<p>Let me conclude by saying that I look forward to working with my former colleagues in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 They will be our partners in this enterprise.\xc2\xa0 I know President Obama had an excellent meeting, as he reported to you, with both Senators Kerry and Lugar.\xc2\xa0 And Rose, Ellen and General Jones and others of us have briefed members along the way.\xc2\xa0 I look forward to working toward ratification to bring this treaty into force.</p>\n<p>Now it\xe2\x80\x99s my great pleasure and honor to turn the podium over to my friend, Secretary Bob Gates.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 This treaty strengthens nuclear stability.\xc2\xa0 It will reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons that both Russia and the United States are permitted to deploy by a third, and maintains an effective verification regime.</p>\n<p>America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear arsenal remains an important pillar of the U.S. defense posture, both to deter potential adversaries and to reassure more than two dozen allies and partners who rely on our nuclear umbrella for their security.</p>\n<p>But it is clear that we can accomplish these goals with fewer nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 The reductions in this treaty will not affect the strength of our nuclear triad.\xc2\xa0 Nor does this treaty limit plans to protect the United States and our allies by improving and deploying missile defense systems.</p>\n<p>Much of the analysis that supported the U.S. negotiating position was provided by the Defense Department\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear posture review, which will be released shortly.</p>\n<p>As the number of weapons declines we will have to invest more heavily in our nuclear infrastructure in order to keep our weapons safe, secure and effective.</p>\n<p>I look forward to working with the Congress to make sure that Departments of Defense and Energy have the funding necessary to properly accomplish this mission.</p>\n<p>The subject of America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear deterrent and this treaty carries special personal meaning for me.\xc2\xa0 My professional career began as a junior Air Force Officer under the Strategic Air Command, and my first assignment 43 years ago was at Whiteman Air Force Base, then home to 150 Minuteman ICBMs.\xc2\xa0 Since 1971, I have been involved in strategic arms negotiations in different capacities at CIA and here at the NSC.\xc2\xa0 And I particularly recall the day President Reagan signed the Intermediate Range Nuclear Treaty, which marked the transition from arms control to disarmament.\xc2\xa0 That process accelerated with START and reaches another important milestone with this treaty.</p>\n<p>The journey we have taken from being one misstep away from mutual assured destruction to the substantial arms reductions of this new agreement is testimony to just how much the world has changed and all of the opportunities we still have to make our planet safer and more secure.</p>\n<p>Admiral Mullen.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL MULLEN:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I would only like to add that I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the final agreements.</p>\n<p>We greatly appreciate the trust and confidence placed by us -- placed in us by the President and by Secretary Gates throughout this process.\xc2\xa0 And we recognize the trust and confidence this treaty helps foster in our relationship with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military -- a trust complementary to that which the President has sought to achieve between our two countries.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I met with my Russian counterpart, General Makarov, no fewer than three times during the negotiation process.\xc2\xa0 And each time we met, we grew closer not only toward our portion of the final result, but also toward a better understanding of the common challenges and opportunities our troops face every single day.</p>\n<p>The new START deals directly with some of the most lethal of those common challenges -- our stockpiles of strategic nuclear weapons -- by dramatically reducing these stockpiles.\xc2\xa0 This treaty achieves a proper balance more in keeping with today\xe2\x80\x99s security environment, reducing tensions even as it bolsters non-proliferation efforts.\xc2\xa0 It features a much more effective, transparent verification method that demands quicker data exchanges and notifications.\xc2\xa0 It protects our ability to develop a conventional global strike capability should that be required.\xc2\xa0 And perhaps more critically, it allows us to deploy and maintain strategic nuclear forces -- bombers, submarines, missiles; the triad which has proven itself over the decades -- in ways best suited to meeting our security commitments.</p>\n<p>In other words, through the trust it engenders, the cuts it requires, and the flexibility it preserves this treaty enhances our ability to do that which we have been charged to do:\xc2\xa0 protect and defend the citizens of the United States.\xc2\xa0 I am as confident in its success as I am in its safeguards.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to take three or four questions here and then let these guys get back to work.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly for Secretary Clinton, how confident are you of early ratification in the Senate?\xc2\xa0 And if I may ask, Secretary Gates, you mentioned no limits on missile defense.\xc2\xa0 Do you foresee, in the future, engaging with Russia more broadly in any kind of limitations on U.S. missile defense?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bob, let me say that we are focused on ratification.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working hard.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to engage deeply and broadly with all of the members of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re also informing members of the House as well.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to set any timetables, but we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make the case for ratification.</p>\n<p>In fact, I think if you look at the last three major nuclear arms treaties, the SORT Treaty of 2003, 95-0; START I Treaty, 1992, 93-6; the INF Treaty, 1988, 93-5.\xc2\xa0 So I think when it comes to the goals of this treaty, and as both Bob and Mike outlined the great balance that it strikes -- there should be very broad bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 I would say that we will continue to try and engage the Russians as partners in this process.\xc2\xa0 One of the technical benefits of the phased adaptive approach that the President announced last year is that it actually makes it easier to connect the Russian radars and capabilities to those in Europe.\xc2\xa0 So we think that there\xe2\x80\x99s still broad opportunity to not only engage the Russians, but hopefully make them a participant in a European-wide defense capability.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 For Secretary Clinton, first of all, do you believe these reductions are enough?\xc2\xa0 And, second, could you expand a little bit more on what this means for the U.S.-Russia relationship?\xc2\xa0 Is the reset complete?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I think that this was, in and of itself a major achievement in our relationship.\xc2\xa0 And equally importantly, it builds to that foundation of trust and confidence that we are establishing between the United States and Russia.\xc2\xa0 This is a very complex relationship, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we have given a great deal of attention to from the President all the way through the national security team, because we believe that there are so many other areas of mutual cooperation that we can pursue.</p>\n<p>Bob mentioned one:\xc2\xa0 We continue to look for ways to engage with Russia on missile defense in a way that is mutually beneficial and protective of our country\xe2\x80\x99s security against these new threats we face in the world.</p>\n<p>But our relationship coming out of the bi-national commission that President Obama and President Medvedev announced last summer has covered so much ground.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to give you all an in-depth briefing on that because I think it demonstrates that we\xe2\x80\x99re not just talking about the big ticket items -- like START, like Iran sanctions, like European security, like missile defense -- we\xe2\x80\x99re back in the business of trying to create more people-to-people contacts and more business investment opportunities.\xc2\xa0 So we are very committed and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work together on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One for the Russian press?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And thanks for doing this and congratulations on your success.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask, you are facing a difficult task of convincing the U.S. Congress to ratify the treaty.\xc2\xa0 And the Russians will face the same task.\xc2\xa0 So I assume the process was bilateral, mutually beneficial.\xc2\xa0 Please tell me how the Russian interests were taken into account in the negotiations and final documents.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, the Russian leadership will be in the best position to speak to the Russian interests and how those were met.\xc2\xa0 But what we both believed as we went through this difficult negotiation was that cutting our arsenals by 30 percent was in the best interest of both of our countries, increasing more confidence between us with respect to our nuclear programs.\xc2\xa0 The kind of decisions that the Russian leadership authorized to be made in this negotiation are clearly, in their view, in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s security interests.</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99re right, just as we have to go to our Congress, President Medvedev has to go to the Duma.\xc2\xa0 And I think President Obama has said that he would send Rahm Emanuel to Moscow -- (laughter) -- and we all immediately endorsed that offer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So if it -- you know, if President Medvedev wants to take us up on it, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, congratulations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a couple of deadlines were missed on the way to today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.\xc2\xa0 What were the sticking points and how were they ultimately resolved?\xc2\xa0 And then what\xe2\x80\x99s your message to Europeans who are still concerned about the nuclear missiles aimed at them from Russia?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 You know, Jake, in any complex negotiation there are going to be points along the way where negotiators have to go back to their capitals; where the negotiators need to delegate in-depth conversations -- you heard Mike Mullen say what he had to do with his counterpart, Bob, I had to talk to my counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, many times, because the Presidents\xe2\x80\x99 -- President Obama and President Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s directions were very clear:\xc2\xa0 We want to do this, and we want to get it done in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>But it took a lot of work.\xc2\xa0 Just a few weeks ago I dispatched Under Secretary Tauscher to Geneva because we needed to make it absolutely clear that this was a priority at the highest levels of our government.\xc2\xa0 The Russians responded to that very positively.\xc2\xa0 And we began to just work out the last details.</p>\n<p>In addition, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that we made a decision that we wanted not just to have the treaty agreed to; we wanted the protocols agreed to.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes treaties in the past have been submitted while the work on the protocols still goes on.\xc2\xa0 But we thought it was important that we really went through all the technical work in the protocols so that when we went to our Senate or when the Russian government went to the Duma, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just, okay, so what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the protocols; it was, okay, we can look at the treaty, we can look at the protocols.\xc2\xa0 So that was also some of the time that had to be taken in order to really get to the point where we both felt like we had the package necessary to go to our legislative bodies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the message to the Europeans?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have consistently conveyed to our European friends and allies America\xe2\x80\x99s absolute commitment to our NATO partners and to their defense.\xc2\xa0 The phased adaptive approach that the President concluded was the best way forward on missile defense we think actually makes Europe safer from what are the real threats that are out there.</p>\n<p>There is still work to be done in the NATO-Russia Council to build confidence in our Central and Eastern European partners with Russia.\xc2\xa0 But everybody is aware that that is something that is still ongoing.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons why it\xe2\x80\x99s so significant that the Presidents will meet in Prague is because we want to send exactly that signal, that this is good for Europe as well as for the United States and Russia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Madam Secretary.\xc2\xa0 I think the average American, when they hear talk of strategic arms reductions, their eyes glaze over.\xc2\xa0 The two things they really worry about are loose nukes getting in the hands of terrorists, which you touched on, and nations like Iran getting nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 Could you explain how this treaty paves the way for progress on those two issues?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, you know, as the President said in his remarks, we have a vision, a long-term vision, of moving toward a world without nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 We are absolutely realistic about how long that will take to convince everyone that this is in the world\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xc2\xa0 But the steps we are taking add up to something that makes a very clear statement of intent.</p>\n<p>So the START treaty, it says to our country, the Cold War really is behind us and these massive nuclear arsenals that both our countries maintained as part of deterrence no longer have to be so big; we can begin to cut that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not only in our security interests, but it also is a commitment by the United States and Russia toward non-proliferation and toward the eventual goal of a world without nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>The nuclear security summit that the President will host in two weeks -- largest gathering of international leaders probably since the end of World War II in the United States -- devoted to the idea of how do we keep nuclear materials out of the hands of rogue regimes and of terrorists.\xc2\xa0 We come with more credibility, Russia comes with more credibility, having negotiated this treaty.</p>\n<p>Then the Non-Proliferation Treaty in May takes it one step further, about how do we bring the non-proliferation regime into the 21st century, when we know, unfortunately, that terrorist groups are seeking nuclear weapons and states that are not -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the confidence of the international community in their ambitions, like Iran and North Korea, are also pursuing nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>So you have to look at this as part of our whole approach toward non-proliferation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Iran come up in the conversation today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- it was a fairly brief conversation finalizing the treaty.\xc2\xa0 President Medvedev mentioned to President Obama that he wanted to speak with him when they met next in the Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>Savannah.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the bipartisan overwhelming majority these treaties have passed with in the past.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that concerns you about this particular political environment that you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get those 67 votes?\xc2\xa0 You can opine on health care while you\xe2\x80\x99re at it, since we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an opportunity.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>And for Secretary Gates, is the Pentagon uncomfortable at all about the President\xe2\x80\x99s go-to-zero campaign, considering we do depend on nuclear weapons for our national security?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, I think that national security has always produced large bipartisan majorities and I see no reason why this should be any different.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a very dynamic political debate in our country over health care, which was brought to a successful conclusion this week to the betterment of the American people going forward.</p>\n<p>But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that this ratification effort will be affected by anything other than individual senators\xe2\x80\x99 assessments of whether this is in the best interest of American security.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, as you heard from Bob and Mike and you will hear from many other experts in the administration over the weeks ahead as we testify and make the case to the press and the public for this treaty, we are absolutely united in our belief that this is in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the particulars of this treaty and it\xe2\x80\x99s in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest because it puts us in a very strong leadership position to make the case about an Iran, about a North Korea, about other countries doing more to safeguard nuclear materials.</p>\n<p>So I believe that a vast majority of the Senate at the end of the day will see that this is in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest and it goes way beyond politics.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Let me first say a word about ratification from my perspective.\xc2\xa0 There has been a very intense continuing consultation on the Hill as the negotiations have proceeded.\xc2\xa0 Two of the areas that have been of concern in the Senate, among senators, are, are we protecting our ability to go forward with missile defense and are we going to make the investment in our nuclear infrastructure so that the stockpile will remain reliable and safe.</p>\n<p>We have addressed both of those.\xc2\xa0 Missile defense is not constrained by this treaty.\xc2\xa0 And we have in our budget, the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget that went to the Hill for FY \xe2\x80\x9911, almost $5 billion for investment in the nuclear infrastructure and maintaining the stockpile.\xc2\xa0 So I think we have addressed the concerns that there may have been on the Hill and so I echo the sentiments of Secretary Clinton, that I think the prospects are quite good.</p>\n<p>In terms of going to nuclear -- to zero nuclear weapons, the President has been very realistic in terms of -- you know, when he originally discussed this -- perhaps not in his lifetime.\xc2\xa0 And we realize that other countries have substantial numbers of nuclear weapons; others are attempting to develop them.\xc2\xa0 So we will do this in a realistic way.</p>\n<p>But what this treaty does, and some of the other steps -- trying to get control of fissile material, the Non-Proliferation Treaty and so on -- are concrete steps to move in that direction.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody expects us to come anywhere close to zero nuclear weapons anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, to what degree in the preamble will missile defense be addressed?\xc2\xa0 And did the Russians in any way, shape, or form insist upon some kind of linkage on future missile defense plans with the United States?\xc2\xa0 And is there any concern that you have about Russian dissatisfaction with the Bulgaria-Romania component that they believe was not adequately conveyed to them before it was released in those two countries?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, if I could -- Robert, could I ask Under Secretary Tauscher to address this?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Just fresh from Geneva.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY TAUSCHER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Madam Secretary.\xc2\xa0 President Obama and President Medvedev met in July and discussed and had an agreement that this is a strategic offensive weapons treaty, and that there is an inter-relationship between strategic offensive and defensive.\xc2\xa0 But that is the discussion -- where the discussion ended.\xc2\xa0 So I think when you see the treaty and the protocol, there are no constraints on missile defense.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Romania, the phased adaptive approach is in phases, as you can see -- 2011, 2015, and 2018 deployments.\xc2\xa0 And we have gone to extensive lengths to brief the Russians.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, the phased adaptive approach has been up on the Web.\xc2\xa0 The Ballistic Missile Defense Review has been up on the Web for weeks and months.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through extensive briefings with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t pre-clear any kind of conversations we have with allies and friends when we do things with them -- with anyone, including the Russians.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly talked to the Russians soon afterwards, and they knew about the Romanian invitation for the 2015 SM-3 deployment.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Roger, do you have one?\xc2\xa0 Did you have one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow up with the Secretary of State on Iran -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve touched on a little bit -- and with that, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation now.\xc2\xa0 What does that portend going ahead with Iran and the sanctions and getting them onboard?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had very constructive talks with all of our partners, and in-depth consultations with the Russians -- most recently last Thursday and Friday when I was in Moscow.\xc2\xa0 We are working on language.\xc2\xa0 The Russians are involved in -- being consulted on that drafting process.</p>\n<p>So we are pursuing the plan that we set forth from the very beginning of this administration -- a two-track process where the first track was engagement, which the President has fulfilled in every way as he has reached out to the Iranians; and the other track of pressure in the event that the Iranians would not engage or refuse to comply with their international obligations.</p>\n<p>The recent IAEA report that Director General Amano put out, summarizing many of the questions that raise concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior was I think widely viewed as an authoritative source -- not coming from the United States -- that summarized why the international community needs to move on this second track.</p>\n<p>So I believe that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see increasing activity in the very near future as we work to bring to fruition a resolution that can muster the votes that are necessary in the Security Council.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Medvedev was going to talk with the President in Prague on this?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, President Medvedev and President Obama have talked about this continuously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk to the President in Prague?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as Robert Gibbs said, when they are together they talk about this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more from Ms. Thomas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In view` of the pressure on Iran, do you know of any country in the Middle East that has nuclear weapons?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Helen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We both got honorary degrees.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 We did.\xc2\xa0 We were -- Helen and I were out on the new Yankee Stadium field for the NYU commencement last --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t step on the grass.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>SECRETARY CLINTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t step on the grass, we were very careful.\xc2\xa0 But, you know, she was, as always, in the center of activity.</p>\n<p>You know, Helen, one of our goals is to try to move, as we have said, the world toward a recognition that nuclear weapons should be phased out.\xc2\xa0 So from our perspective, that is our goal in fulfilling the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision.\xc2\xa0 It is what we are doing with the nuclear security summit, where a number of countries from the region of the Middle East will be present.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference in June.\xc2\xa0 And it remains one of our highest priorities.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reaffirm our commitment to convincing countries that the path of non-proliferation, of lowering the temperature when it comes to nuclear weapons -- which we are doing with this treaty -- is the path they want to be on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Verification is such an important part of this whole process.\xc2\xa0 And for the American people, when they hear you talking about the new treaty, how can you assure them or what would you say to them about your level of confidence in the verification process that says that everyone will be working in good faith here?\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 The verification measures for this treaty have been designed to monitor compliance with the provisions with this treaty.\xc2\xa0 So, for example, because their -- our throw-weight of missiles was not an issue, for example, telemetry is not nearly as important for this treaty as it has been in the past.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need telemetry to monitor compliance with this treaty.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there still is a bilateral agreement to exchange telemetry information on up to five missile launches a year.\xc2\xa0 I think that when the testimony of the intelligence community comes on the Hill, that the DNI and the experts will say that they are comfortable that the provisions of this treaty for verification are adequate for them to monitor Russian compliance, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:23 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
