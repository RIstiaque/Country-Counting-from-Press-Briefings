EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That pretty much sums it up.\xc2\xa0 Anybody have any questions?\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Let me follow real quickly on two points the President made.\xc2\xa0 So is he then ruling out White House support for an interim increase in the debt ceiling? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard him say -- the President say quite clearly, that he does not share the view that he has heard some in Congress hold that we should support some sort of short-term deal that kicks the can down the road on significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we have now a unique opportunity -- the result of a confluence of events and decisions -- that gives us a chance to do something big, that can set us on a solid footing for the 21st century as we build our economy, get our fiscal house in order at a crucial time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he strongly believes -- and I think you just heard him say this -- that leaders were elected to lead, to make hard choices, to compromise, and to take some flack for that compromise, because it requires tough choices.\xc2\xa0 So I think he said quite clearly that he does not believe that is the right course.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also used the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cover the next two weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I want to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re clear on this.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House consider to be really the hard deadline to reach a deal, to get this done in time to get it through Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will leave it to what the President said in terms of the next two weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s important, because as he said in his press conference last week, and again just now, we should not leave this to the last minute.\xc2\xa0 August 2nd, as affirmed again by the analysts at the Treasury Department, is a real, serious deadline.\xc2\xa0 The consequences of defaulting on our obligations for the first time in the history of this country would be serious and unpredictable.\xc2\xa0 So we need to move quickly.\xc2\xa0 We should not procrastinate.\xc2\xa0 We need to get this done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think he spoke about two weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re at the last fall here.\xc2\xa0 So two weeks, no interim debt ceiling raise as an option, for the reasons he stated.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got basically two weeks to reach a two-plus-trillion-dollar plan and you\xe2\x80\x99re at the stalemate over revenues.\xc2\xa0 What happens if you don\xe2\x80\x99t hit that in two weeks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want speculate about what might happen if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get deal that we should get.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible, it\xe2\x80\x99s achievable, that the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made is significant, and that there is the will within both parties.\xc2\xa0 As the President just said, there are members -- there are enough members, he believes, in both parties, who believe in the necessity of reaching for a big deal, and are willing to make the compromise necessary to do that; that we should -- we need to take action for that reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, with the meeting on Thursday that he just announced, does that mean there will not be -- he will not be attending the meeting on the Hill tomorrow as he\xe2\x80\x99s been invited to attend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have no plans for that tomorrow, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So, and -- so all other invitations that have been issued from the Hill at this point are not being accepted by the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President spoke with the leaders.\xc2\xa0 He has invited them to come to the White House to move these talks forward on Thursday, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the next meeting that we anticipate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looking even past that, do you have any sense, in terms of further follow-up meetings --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other meetings to announce for you.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a relatively dynamic and fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you that these conversations continue at a variety of levels.\xc2\xa0 They have continued consistently since the Vice President began the formal negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that they have made progress, I think, is important and worth noting, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes we have the opportunity now to get something serious done for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is not a deal --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That sounds like a speculative question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was trying to think how I could phrase that differently, but that\xe2\x80\x99s still --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Better than I did.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- still think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick with it.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House consider using the 14th Amendment as a way to raise the debt ceiling?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I want to get into speculation about what might happen if something does or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 The President believes firmly that a deal is possible; that if the players here all check their absolutist positions and their rhetoric at the door and accept the basic premise that we all agree on what the problem is, we all agree on the broad outlines of what the solution is, and that if we can negotiate and compromise on the details of how we get there, we can do something significant that will be beneficial for the American people, beneficial for American economy and good for America\xe2\x80\x99s standing going into the 21st century, a very competitive economic century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans on the Hill say that some of the spin coming from the White House is inaccurate, that the White House and Democrats had not signed off to trillions to dollars in spending cuts, that it was roughly $1 trillion; and that they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t actually agreed to any of them, and there were a bunch of gimmicks contained within that trillion.\xc2\xa0 Can you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, Jake, that we have not commented on the specifics of the negotiations that the Vice President led.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to start doing that now.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the President has always said -- the Vice President has said, others have said -- that we obviously agree to the proposition that nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that will hold true in these negotiations, that compromise necessitates all the pieces coming together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what I can guarantee you is that significant progress was made towards reducing spending in those conversations and that more progress needs to be made in order to get this thing done.\xc2\xa0 And that progress needs to come in all the facets that the President talked about -- in non-defense discretionary spending and defense spending, in entitlement spending, and in spending in the tax code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the Fast and Furious program -- I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s this investigation going on internally -- weapons from the Fast and Furious program are now showing up in the United States attached to criminal transactions.\xc2\xa0 The ABC station in Phoenix last week reported on several of these weapons from Fast and Furious turning up.\xc2\xa0 How come we know so little -- the public knows so little about this program?\xc2\xa0 And what is the administration doing to get to the bottom of these weapons, which are now showing up in crimes in the United States? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation going on precisely to get to the bottom of this.\xc2\xa0 And I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment further on it, because there is an investigation going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can the acting head of the BATF be permitted to go to Capitol Hill to testify?\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that the -- that he has not been allowed by the administration to go there and explain what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to refer you to Justice on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this not something that you guys are worried about and incensed about?\xc2\xa0 This is something --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated for a reason.\xc2\xa0 And obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of concern and that\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation.\xc2\xa0 But it would be a mistake for me to comment further on -- or to characterize further what happened or how to rate our unhappiness about it from here.\xc2\xa0 So I think that I have to refer you to the Justice Department for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, I mean, we have heard at times when the President was upset about something -- \xe2\x80\x9cplug the damn hole,\xe2\x80\x9d is one such anecdote that was shared exclusively with every single person in this room by the White House.\xc2\xa0 Do you -- is the President upset about this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a government operation where now weapons -- I mean, the Mexicans are upset that guns are now turning up in --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you could assume that the President takes this very seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No one has lost their job.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation going on, so to comment on people\xe2\x80\x99s jobs and that sort of thing is inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 But the President takes it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 I think he made clear when the -- during the Mexican state visit and the press conference he had then that he found out about this through news reports.\xc2\xa0 And he takes it very seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to that \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d question.\xc2\xa0 If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to reach a long-term deal, what other options are on the table?\xc2\xa0 Or do you have any other options on the table?\xc2\xa0 Is the President essentially saying, no mini deals no matter what; only a long-term option here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have to think big and act big, because, as I mentioned before, there has been a confluence of events and decisions that have led us to this point.\xc2\xa0 And they include obviously the terrible recession, the worst since the Great Depression that we went through; the fact that because Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t act the President appointed the Simpson-Bowles Commission and they delivered a report; we have the outside Domenici-Rivlin report; we have the President\xe2\x80\x99s framework that he put forward and the Republican budget that passed the House -- all of which describe a problem and a solution in generally the same terms.\xc2\xa0 The big exception is 3-1 they propose solutions that demand a balanced approach, which obviously the President supports.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not the kind of situation that comes around very frequently, and the President believes that it is worth the inevitable political difficulty that making tough choices creates to get this done for the American people, for American economy.\xc2\xa0 So he does not share the view, does not believe it is wise to pursue a short-term solution that essentially would be kicking the can down the road and not at all addressing or solving the problem. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The problem is there in front of us.\xc2\xa0 We know what it would take to solve it or to seriously address it.\xc2\xa0 And we should move forward with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand is when he says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s wise or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t share the view, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean necessarily that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t embrace it if that\xe2\x80\x99s what it takes at the last minute.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was pretty clear that he does not support going in that direction.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear prior to that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate a lot of -- you know, sort of \xe2\x80\x9cwhat happens if\xe2\x80\x9d from here.\xc2\xa0 And this is a process that will continue, I think, fairly intensively, in the coming days and weeks.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully it will result in a broad agreement on significant deficit reduction that then also allows the Congress to move forward with making sure that the United States of America does not for the first time in its history default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then another question on the Minnesota government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President has been watching, paying attention to?\xc2\xa0 Any comment on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a conversation with him about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House seen any sign that Republicans are willing to bend on revenues?\xc2\xa0 The President suggested there has been some progress -- more progress going on recently.\xc2\xa0 Any signs that they\xe2\x80\x99re even thinking about bending on revenues?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, without getting into the details of what is or isn\xe2\x80\x99t in a possible agreement -- because a lot of work needs to be done and a lot of tough choices remain to be made -- the President obviously believes, as he said right here, that there is the will in Congress present and enough members from each party to pass a significant deficit reduction deal that would be balanced. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The specifics of how that occurs and what elements are in it, what kind of -- how it addresses the need to reduce spending in the tax code, I\xe2\x80\x99m not and I won\xe2\x80\x99t negotiate from here.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that opportunity is significant enough that the President has invited the leaders here for Thursday, and we anticipate pretty intense negotiations going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the 14th Amendment question, is that being studied by White House lawyers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not even being discussed --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, people read the newspaper, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that anybody is studying it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not anything you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Definitely not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- economists who feel that because some Republicans are willing to forego raising the debt ceiling and no Democrats are, they hold the cards and you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that logic?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That they hold the cards because they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re willing forego raising the debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- cause a calamity?\xc2\xa0 I mean, \xe2\x80\x9cforego\xe2\x80\x9d is an interesting verb to use, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about doing something that\xe2\x80\x99s never happened in this -- in the history of this country.\xc2\xa0 I will spare you, because I know it\xe2\x80\x99s late in the day and you\xe2\x80\x99re on deadline, reading again the letter from President Reagan, reading again the letter from then Treasury Secretary Jim Baker about the absolute necessity that the United States fulfill its obligations and pay its debts. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is -- again, this is not a vote to increase spending.\xc2\xa0 This is a vote to pay the bills that Congress ran up.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that there are some members who seem to think that that\xe2\x80\x99s not an important obligation to fulfill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re willing, apparently, to go there, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s like saying, you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to put a gun to your head and pull the trigger, and is that wise?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 And especially when it\xe2\x80\x99s not just you who would suffer, it\xe2\x80\x99s the entire country and the global economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Weekly Standard, based on the seventh quarterly report on the stimulus bill, calculated that the jobs paid for cost, by its calculation, $278,000 each.\xc2\xa0 If you use the larger number of jobs created, it\xe2\x80\x99s $178,000 a job.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with the math there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important note that, yes, the Weekly Standard did this analysis, and you should view it through that prism, I suppose. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The study -- the report is based on partial information and simply false analysis.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Recovery Act was meant to do much more than just create and save jobs; it was also an investment in American infrastructure, education, and industries like clean energy that is critical to America\xe2\x80\x99s long-term success, and investment in the economic future of America\xe2\x80\x99s working families.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the Recovery Act, 110 million working families received a tax cut through the Making Work Pay tax credit.\xc2\xa0 Over 110,000 small businesses received critical access to capital through $27 billion in small business loans.\xc2\xa0 And more than 75,000 projects were started nationwide to improve our infrastructure, jumpstart emerging industries, and spur local economic development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you can do a lot of creative math and come up with an outcome that supports a particular editorial point of view, but the fact is the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the Recovery Act delivered as promised, lowering the unemployment rate by as much as 2 percent, boosting the GDP significantly, and creating and saving as many as 3.6 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 We concur with that nonpartisan analysis. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One, can you brief us on these meetings the President referred to over the weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- but there were meetings -- I mean, there were meetings with congressional leaders?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do a -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s news to some folks on the Senate side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that there are conversations, meetings that will take place during this process as they do in the normal course of events, but during this process that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out.\xc2\xa0 And I think the point the President was making is simply that we have been working this continually, daily -- through the weekend, through the weeks gone by -- and that meetings and conversations continued over the weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you -- and this is playing the rest of the question, but can you square this issue of the President saying, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t deal with a short-term deal, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two weeks to get it done?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how is it that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- iron out all of these issues with I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re inviting seven people to this meeting on Thursday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s eight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eight or more people at a meeting, the perception is the less they can get done --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not so big.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are conversations going on that -- this meeting is part of a process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important part, but it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a process that has been ongoing for a number of weeks now, and months, even.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, we are on a tight deadline.\xc2\xa0 But we have traversed a lot of terrain.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet, but there has been significant progress already and we --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you can get a big deal, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t get it in two weeks, but you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get it in six weeks --- you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to work around that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- calendar in some form or another?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think to stand here and say, yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s kick the can down the road because we need another six months is crazy, because we know --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you needed another couple of weeks --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like -- this issue didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s desks this week or last week.\xc2\xa0 People have been studying this and debating it and proposing different solutions for a long time now, as you know.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve reported on them in detail.\xc2\xa0 And we know what the parameters of a solution look like. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know what the tradeoffs are that are involved that would be required to reach a compromise, a compromise that by definition requires each side -- Republicans and Democrats -- to get outside their comfort zones, to accept cuts they don\xe2\x80\x99t like, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in non-defense discretionary, in defense; whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in entitlement spending or in the tax code.\xc2\xa0 People are going to have to accept something less than the ideal, because you know what, the ideal will never become law.\xc2\xa0 Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a conservative House Republican or a liberal Senate Democrat or you\xe2\x80\x99re the President of the United States, you will not get 100 percent of what you want.\xc2\xa0 Our system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he meeting with Tom Coburn, Saxby Chambliss, Republicans that have indicated they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to cut a deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into all the different kinds of meetings and conversations that have taken place over the days and weeks that have gone by.\xc2\xa0 In the end, anything that is agreed upon has to be passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 Leaders play an important role in making that happen.\xc2\xa0 So meeting with leaders is an important part of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to meet with these other folks that are actually wanting to be in the process?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We may or may not.\xc2\xa0 And we may or may not read out those meetings.\xc2\xa0 The point is, is that the meeting the President announced today is part of this process.\xc2\xa0 It demonstrates his commitment to reaching to try to get something big that he thinks the American people overwhelmingly expect us to get.\xc2\xa0 You know this, you get out there and report and you find out when you\xe2\x80\x99re on the road reporting on the country, and you look at it and the polling data and the focus groups -- Americans are not, like, I demand this -- you know, I draw the red line here and I draw this in the sand. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They just want us to get something done that\xe2\x80\x99s sensible, that spreads the sacrifice and spreads the prosperity that hopefully a significant deal will help produce.\xc2\xa0 So with that in mind, I think the President is willing to make the hard choices, and he expects others to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The President sounded much more positive about getting a deal than he did less than a week ago.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair assessment?\xc2\xa0 And why is he so much more positive now than he was last week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we have always said -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- you guys can analyze his tone and parse his language, but I think he has -- we have been for a long time now pleased with the progress that has been made in the negotiations thus far, concerned about the urgency that everyone needs to feel to get to a final agreement, and optimistic that a final agreement can be reached.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the -- those notions were all expressed by the President last week at his press conference and again this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking, are we closer to a deal now than we were last week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that there have been -- there has been progress every step of the way.\xc2\xa0 Not every day has been a big step in the right direction, or has produced a big step in the right direction, but there has been progress steadily throughout this process.\xc2\xa0 Does that help?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including a lot in the last, like, eight days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think that the President referenced the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversations and meetings, but the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he has personally, right, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said, that he\xe2\x80\x99s had personal discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said.\xc2\xa0 The point being that we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet, and he made that very clear at the very top of his statement.\xc2\xa0 We have some difficult terrain yet to cross.\xc2\xa0 But a deal is possible.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s within reach if people are willing to basically take the risk to get something big done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does your answer to Chip mean that the White House does not assert the President has got the authority to circumvent the 14th Amendment and -- circumvent the debt limit by virtue of the 14th Amendment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re reading far more into that than I intended.\xc2\xa0 I simply said that I am not aware of any analysis being done by lawyers here, and I have not heard the President discuss it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, is the administration offering Iraq to keep troops there after the end of the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, our plan is to fulfill our obligations with the agreement, the Status of Forces Agreement, with the Iraqi government, which requires us to withdraw all U.S. forces by the end of this year, this calendar year.\xc2\xa0 We intend to keep that agreement; we are on track to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have also said that we would consider a request by the Iraqi government for some sort of sustained presence by U.S. troops.\xc2\xa0 That request has not been made.\xc2\xa0 We are on track to withdraw all our forces down to zero by December 31st of this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, any plans for the President to attend the launch or the return of the last shuttle flight at the end of the week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wish I could say yes, because I would love to go with him, but I have no such scheduling announcement to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President veto a short-term debt -- a short-term deficit measure if that\xe2\x80\x99s what it took to avoid a default?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to trying to get a big deal.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to issue a veto threat from here.\xc2\xa0 I think his focus right now is on working with members of Congress, with leaders and other important members to try to get something significant done. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, does the President want Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to stay on board through the election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would just point you to what Secretary Geithner said, which he will be here for the foreseeable future.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner has been a highly valued and valuable member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic team, and he depends on him every day, and will for the foreseeable future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the meeting on Thursday have an end time, or do you see this as kind of the beginning of the marathon all-night sessions that we saw with the 2011 budget negotiations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we did not suggest to members that they bring their pillows and blankets, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said you expect intense negotiations going forward -- is the sense that that would be daily?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to announce a schedule.\xc2\xa0 We have been in conversations and have had meetings of different kinds with different folks on a daily basis, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement to announce to you today from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, have all the parties said yes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be here at the meeting on Thursday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And will it be at Blair House or here?\xc2\xa0 Do you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be here in the White House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the thinking behind doing it here rather than accepting the invitations from the Hill?\xc2\xa0 Is there something --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get leaders from both parties, both houses, together as we approach a deadline, and that -- as I said last week, he has obviously met with conferences and caucuses from both houses and both parties previously, as well as having had meetings with other members and leaders in the past.\xc2\xa0 So he thinks this is the right time for this sort of meeting, this week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on something Mark asked.\xc2\xa0 Is there actually an offer on the table from the administration to the Karzai government to send -- to keep 10,000 troops in Iraq after the end of the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean the Maliki government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information to suggest that were true.\xc2\xa0 I think that we are waiting -- awaiting to see whether or not the Iraqi government makes a request of us.\xc2\xa0 That has not happened.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously now in July.\xc2\xa0 We are drawing down to zero.\xc2\xa0 We are on schedule to draw down to zero by December 31st, in keeping with our agreement with the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue doing that as planned.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of -- I mean, not sensitivity, but there\xe2\x80\x99s only so much time here available for the Iraqi government to make such a request.\xc2\xa0 If they do, we will consider it.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise we are keeping on schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much time before that\xe2\x80\x99s not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know what, I would refer you to the Defense Department because this has to do with the logistics of drawing down forces, principally.\xc2\xa0 But I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not an endless amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just clarify the debt ceiling achievement that the President would like to see?\xc2\xa0 The estimate is that if the debt ceiling goes up 2.4, it would take everybody through the end of 2012.\xc2\xa0 So is that what the President is shooting at?\xc2\xa0 Can I just clarify?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding, Alexis, is that he was referring to -- I mean, we have seen reports of people talking about very short-term agreements to allow for six more months of negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That is not a proposition the President supports.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable and something else is acceptable, because the President believes very strongly, as he just told you, that we should be shooting -- aiming higher; that we -- that if we have the political will collectively, Democrats and Republicans, to do the right thing by the American people, that we can actually achieve a significant deficit reduction deal in the trillions that is balanced, that sends a signal around the globe that we are getting our fiscal house in order and that will produce a boost of confidence in the American economy that we think will continue to allow it to grow and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I just want to clarify.\xc2\xa0 He is not coming to the table, trying to de-link the two from the Republicans, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have said -- we have acknowledged that while we do not believe that something as serious as the need for the United States to fulfill its obligations and not default on its obligations should be linked to any vote that may or may not happen.\xc2\xa0 We accept the fact that some members of Congress insist that we get a deficit reduction deal in tandem with, if you will, the vote to raise the debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe that the debt ceiling will be raised.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the United States will not default on its obligations for the first time in its history.\xc2\xa0 We take the leaders of Congress at their word that they will fulfill that obligation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that we have any doubt that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 We are also pursuing a significant deficit reduction deal concurrently.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the two things remain linked, then the number that they\xe2\x80\x99re shooting for is going to be linked to however long that debt ceiling is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s up to Congress to decide.\xc2\xa0 How much they raise the debt ceiling is for Congress to decide.\xc2\xa0 We are negotiating a deficit reduction deal.\xc2\xa0 We believe it can be significant.\xc2\xa0 It can be in the trillions.\xc2\xa0 It can be of the size and scope that has been agreed upon, broadly speaking, by all the significant players in this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s for Congress to decide the size of -- how high the ceiling is raised, not for us.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s for them to decide whether to link that.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to weigh in on that particularly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to foreshadow what he may or may not say in a negotiation, but we do not view it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then the other thing I wanted to ask is, when we saw the President last week, what prevented him from saying then exactly what he said today, and things might have moved a week faster?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What does that mean exactly?\xc2\xa0 The President has been engaged --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President just said, I want to see you; come see me.\xc2\xa0 He could have said that last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President met -- again, is this the \xe2\x80\x9cthe President is not engaged\xe2\x80\x9d talking point, because I think the President has met with the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the House Speaker, the House Minority Leader, relevant members.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has led these negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what happened between last week and today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to move on, too, because there are other people here -- we are progressing down the road towards what we believe could be a significant achievement for the American people if everyone, Democrats, Republicans, are willing to accept something less than their absolutist positions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if you are asked to keep more troops in Iraq past December 31st, how do you pay for that?\xc2\xa0 And are you thinking about the cost of that yet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will have to bump that to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific answer for you on that.\xc2\xa0 We are, as of now, on track to withdraw all of the U.S. forces in Iraq by the end of this year, as dictated by the agreement we have with the Iraqi government and as promised by the President of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have said for a long time now if the Iraqi government asks us to maintain some level of troops beyond that end-of-the-year deadline, we would consider it.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean we would do it.\xc2\xa0 We would just consider it.\xc2\xa0 And I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information on that possible outcome, because, again, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even gotten a request.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Abby, do you have a question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, just a quick follow-up on an earlier question.\xc2\xa0 You never really responded to the Senate Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 request for a similar meeting that Mitch McConnell requested.\xc2\xa0 Do you also believe that a meeting like that is not worth having a conversation --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand that that phrase that I used has been slightly taken out of context and used for talking point purposes.\xc2\xa0 My point then was that, as described to us, the invitation was for the President to go hear articulated an absolutist position that we already know.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it.\xc2\xa0 We understand that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are now at a point where we\xe2\x80\x99re beyond that, where we believe that we have to negotiate a compromise, an agreement.\xc2\xa0 So more productive than doing that again, which the President already did in a session that he thought was very helpful and useful, a listening session with Senate Republicans, that it was important this week, because of the urgency of the matter, to move forward with a meeting with the leaders that he\xe2\x80\x99s called for Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re the same type of meeting or a different type of meeting, just to be clear?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the meeting with Democrats that they requested and the meeting with Republicans that they requested were for the same purpose, to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure what story you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to write here, like who are we offending by not -- I mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking what your response is to Senate Reid\xe2\x80\x99s request.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President thinks that the meeting now that we need to have is the one that he called for Thursday.\xc2\xa0 The most productive meeting for him to participate in and lead, if you will, is the one called for Thursday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have anything on General Allen and Ambassador Crocker\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the President, and anything at all beyond the specifics I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President did meet today with Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Lieutenant General John Allen to discuss the way forward in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden, National Security Advisor Donilon, Secretary Panetta -- the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that -- Secretary Panetta and Admiral Mullen also joined the meeting. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President and his team discussed implementation of the next phase of our strategy in Afghanistan, including consolidation of the gains that have been made in breaking the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum and training Afghan security forces; the reduction of U.S. troop levels that the President announced last month; and the process of transitioning lead security responsibility to the Afghan government. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President thanked Ambassador Crocker and General Allen for their service, extraordinary in both cases, and said that he looked forward to working with them closely as they take up their important positions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction at all to the comments by Lieberman, McCain and Graham in Kabul about concerns, continuing concerns about weakening of the effort by the pace of the drawdown?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not in this meeting.\xc2\xa0 I believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed that issue.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly that because of the success we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in making progress towards achieving our goals -- defeating, disrupting -- or disrupting, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda, reducing -- stopping the momentum of the Taliban, and training up Afghan security forces that we can begin to draw down the surge forces 10,000 this year; another 23,000 by next summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow, Jay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
