EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 As you know, in 15 minutes the President will be meeting with the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate -- the President and Vice President will be meeting with them -- in the Oval Office to continue their discussions about the need to fully fund the government through the end of this fiscal year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I anticipate that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have questions for me about that, which I can entertain, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that I won\xe2\x80\x99t have much to say about that process since when I take those questions the meeting will be happening.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will get back to you after that meeting is finished.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, I have with me today Jeff Zients, whom I know many of you know.\xc2\xa0 He is the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget.\xc2\xa0 He is responsible for overseeing the process for the entire federal government of dealing with contingency plans should there be a stop in funding if, in fact, there is a shutdown of government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the plans that exist.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of questions for me over the last days and weeks about what might happen if we cannot reach resolution.\xc2\xa0 And Jeff is a much better person to answer those questions, so I have him with me here today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will turn it over to him.\xc2\xa0 Questions on other issues, direct to me.\xc2\xa0 Questions on the President and these negotiations, direct to me.\xc2\xa0 And Jeff will start now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a few words up front and then take questions.\xc2\xa0 The Office of Management and Budget, as all of you know, in addition to its budgeting role, is the agency that helps the President manage the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 Jack Lew, our director, has asked me to be his point person on contingency planning, and our team has been at work working closely with the agencies across the past several weeks as they update their plans and refine them for how they will operate if Congress is unable to pass a funding bill for the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This week, given the Friday deadline, we ramped up our planning and are making the prudent moves necessary to have an orderly shutdown in case it should come to that.\xc2\xa0 This morning we had a call with agency chiefs of staff and deputy secretaries and recommended they begin to notify their employees about the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 shutdown plans.\xc2\xa0 These conversations will include what agency services will remain open and what employees will be furloughed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Agencies also will begin to brief various stakeholders, including contractors, federal employee unions, state and local governments, grantees, key stakeholders about the agency shutdown plans.\xc2\xa0 Also this afternoon, OMB Director Lew will issue official guidance to the agencies, instructing them to take steps to prepare for a possible lapse in funding.\xc2\xa0 That memorandum will soon be posted on the OMB website.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re taking these steps because responsible management demands it.\xc2\xa0 We still hope that we do not have to execute the plans, but we are prepared to implement if necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is a shutdown it would have very real effects on the services the American people rely on, as well as on the economy as a whole.\xc2\xa0 In terms of how a shutdown would play out, generally speaking, services that are critical to safety of life and protection of property are excepted from a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Services that have alternative sources of funding, such as advanced appropriations, mandatory funds, or user fees, can also stay open.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me give some specific examples on what would be closed versus what would be open.\xc2\xa0 As to what would be closed, the Federal Housing Administration -- FHA -- would not endorse any single-family mortgage loans or have staff available to process and approve new multi-family loans.\xc2\xa0 FHA single-family lending represents a market share of more than 20 percent of overall loan volume of home purchases and refinancings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There would be no new approvals of SBA-guaranteed loans for business working capital, real estate investment or job-creation activities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNational parks, national forests, and the Smithsonian Institution would all be closed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe NIH Clinical Center will not take new patients, and no new clinical trials will start.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThose filing paper tax returns would not receive tax refunds from the IRS, and many taxpayers would not be able to receive service from the IRS to help them meet their tax obligations.\xc2\xa0 For example, the 400 walk-in service centers would all be closed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPermits and other approvals will not be processed, such as permits and clearances the EPA issues to allow building projects to proceed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Mine Safety and Health Administration would not be able to conduct regular safety and health inspections.\xc2\xa0 Only emergency passport services would be open.\xc2\xa0 Normal processing will not.\xc2\xa0 Most of the veteran benefits customer support services would be suspended.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMost Department of Defense budget planning in preparation would cease and military personnel will not receive paychecks during a funding lapse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Customer service will be significantly impacted across the federal government.\xc2\xa0 For instance, if you have a question about your Social Security check or Medicare reimbursement, it may be very difficult to get an answer.\xc2\xa0 Throughout the government, websites and online services will be shut down or at limited functionality.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs to some of the activities that will continue if there\xe2\x80\x99s a shutdown, the FAA would keep the air traffic control system open and safe.\xc2\xa0 FEMA disaster operations would continue.\xc2\xa0 Social Security checks will be sent to beneficiaries.\xc2\xa0 National Weather Service alerts and forecasts, as well as volcano and earthquake monitoring by other agencies, would continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tU.S. Postal Service would continue mail collection, delivery, and other operations.\xc2\xa0 Custom and Border Protection activity would continue.\xc2\xa0 Military operations in Afghanistan, Libya, and Iraq would continue.\xc2\xa0 NASA satellite missions currently in operation would continue.\xc2\xa0 SNAP, or what\xe2\x80\x99s better known as food stamps and other child nutrition benefits would continue.\xc2\xa0 Most federal student aid operations would continue.\xc2\xa0 Core federal law enforcement such as FBI and U.S. Marshals would continue, as would prison and detention operations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that overview, let me now open it up for questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead -- let me just say that Jeff is a font of information.\xc2\xa0 But if you dig deep down in questions about specific agencies and operations within those agencies and how they\xe2\x80\x99re affected, he\xe2\x80\x99ll likely have to refer you to those agencies.\xc2\xa0 So think about that when you\xe2\x80\x99re asking questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 One of the scenarios being thrown about is that if a shutdown happens, it might last for a few days, that that\xe2\x80\x99s the period of time it would take for all parties to agree.\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize the effect of a shutdown on the economy and the American people if in fact it only lasts for a few days?\xc2\xa0 Would that be a seriously harmful force or is it only a sustained shutdown that would cause that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Funding lapse is I guess early Saturday morning, 12:01 a.m., so it is a weekend.\xc2\xa0 So if your few days were a couple days on the weekend, obviously less of an impact than if it was several business days.\xc2\xa0 But between the FHA, the IRS that I talked about, businesses -- having come from the private sector, the inability to get a permit, that slows things down and leads to fewer jobs and other ramifications for the economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, overall, if we were to have a shutdown, obviously the shorter the better.\xc2\xa0 But the impact I think will be immediately felt on the economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think that -- is it fair to say that if it should last only a few days, that that -- I mean, I guess to kind of sum this up, that\xe2\x80\x99s not that big of a deal, which is kind of an argument that\xe2\x80\x99s being posed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 When I think about the scale of the number of operations that will be shut down and then would be have to be reopened, I think the impact on the economy, even for a short period of time, could be relatively significant.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, what does it say about confidence in the country if the government actually indeed shuts down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Caren.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the government still be able to release economic data?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 For the most part -- to Jay\xe2\x80\x99s question -- for the most part, no, but specific, statistical agencies should follow up with the agencies who can give you the detailed answer to that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, why would the decision be made, or how is the decision made that troops, who you say will continue to be fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, would not receive paychecks while Social Security checks --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s actually -- that\xe2\x80\x99s actually not a decision.\xc2\xa0 That comes from what is their funding source.\xc2\xa0 And if we have no money in the annual appropriations we can\xe2\x80\x99t pay the troops.\xc2\xa0 So they will continue to earn their money, but they will not receive paychecks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just because it\xe2\x80\x99s a different source than Social Security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the other question I have is it sounds like it would -- based on what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it would be a good idea for President Obama to sign the short-term funding bill that the House Republicans are putting out that we just got a veto threat about.\xc2\xa0 Would it not be better for the country?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I think, as you mentioned, we have issued a veto threat on that measure, and the reasoning behind that is precisely because the President has signed several short-term extensions to allow for time to continue negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Those negotiations have gone on for quite a while now.\xc2\xa0 They, at the highest level, begin again in a few minutes.\xc2\xa0 And he remains confident that if all sides are reasonable, all sides are willing to give, all sides are willing to accept that they cannot get 100 percent of what they want, that we should get this done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has said also that he willing to sign a short-term CR that is essentially clean, that allows for time to get an agreement that might be reached -- time for that agreement to work its way through the Congress because of the rules and procedures in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 But he does not believe that we should sign another short-term measure that carries within it a lot of policy implications in order to kick this can down the road and pay the tollbooth any longer.\xc2\xa0 It is simply no way to do business.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are at a point now, as you know, where the President and Democrats have demonstrated their willingness to come more than halfway, if you -- towards the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 If you start here with zero and here with 100, 73 is quite a distance.\xc2\xa0 If you start here with zero and here with 61, 33 is significantly more than halfway.\xc2\xa0 And in these negotiations, what has to happen is a closing of the gap, not a furthering of the gap.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we also believe, as the President said last night -- for those of you who stayed late -- and has said previously, that this is not the vehicle, this is not the appropriate vehicle to have ideological or political agenda items debated and voted on.\xc2\xa0 They can be done elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 This work needs to be completed.\xc2\xa0 The funding of the government, the substantial spending cuts that are included in these measures and that the President and Democrats are very willing to support, that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And it can be done very quickly if all sides are reasonable and reach an agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the veto threat, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see -- other than the idea that it serves as a distraction, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see enumerated the policy implications that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what is in this short-term CR that the President finds objectionable?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The point is, is that the President and the Democrats, we have been negotiating in good faith and we have closed the gap.\xc2\xa0 As the President said last night in the meeting he had, a long meeting with the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader, that it clarified some of the issues that remained, it narrowed the number of issues that remain, and staff worked literally through the night on those issues, and that we have already demonstrated how we can get to substantial spending cuts -- the largest in history, larger as a percentage of the GDP since 1982 in Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s first term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 It is the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 position.\xc2\xa0 We do not need another short-term measure with $12 billion of additional spending cuts separate from these negotiations because we are now at a point where we can get the deal done.\xc2\xa0 The people expect us to get the deal done.\xc2\xa0 It is simply small ball compared to the big issues that we face, and it is enormously frustrating I think for most Americans to see politics or other issues separate -- create a situation, a stalemate situation, that could lead to a shutdown of government that creates the kind of problems that Jeff just enumerated.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President called the meeting today; that\xe2\x80\x99s why he called it last night; that\xe2\x80\x99s why he is so focused on it right now, so we can get this done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s -- if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start down that road, what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do, so that Jeff can get back to work, is if you have more questions specifically for him on his issues, let\xe2\x80\x99s do that.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise we\xe2\x80\x99ll let him go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you can just tell us what a shutdown would look like at the White House here, who would be impacted.\xc2\xa0 Would much of the staff not be essential?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The White House is part of the Executive Office of the President.\xc2\xa0 The Executive Office of the President is using the same framework that I talked about before in terms of funding sources and activities to determine who\xe2\x80\x99s furloughed and who\xe2\x80\x99s not furloughed.\xc2\xa0 And the bottom line is there will be many fewer staff at the White House if indeed we\xe2\x80\x99re shut down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us anything more specific than that?\xc2\xa0 Will the chief of staff be working?\xc2\xa0 Will Jay be working?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Commissioned officers are working and politically appointed Senate-confirmed folks are working.\xc2\xa0 Many political appointees will not be working.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the effect on the economy of FHA and Small Business Administration and all that kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 But this is an administration that believes that government spending can stimulate the economy.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest effect on the economy kind of the anti-stimulus of having 800,000 people suddenly not working and not doing government work?\xc2\xa0 Is this an anti-stimulus, exactly the opposite of the stimulus plan the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, 800,000 is the number of folks that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work in 1995, and we believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in that same vicinity if indeed the government is shut down.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, that has a -- to use your words -- anti-stimulus effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that more powerful than the SBA and FHA and all those kind of things?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that really what would affect the economy most?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Actually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think that while that\xe2\x80\x99s not insignificant, and also we have to think about those lives, 800,000 people and their families and how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be impacted -- and these are dedicated public servants -- I think the effect of FHA on the housing market, people not getting their tax returns, SBA loans -- these collectively have a major impact on the economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick semantics questions.\xc2\xa0 Do you still use \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnon-essential,\xe2\x80\x9d and would it be accurate, as Michele Bachmann says, to call this a government slowdown, not a government shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a bunch of different legal terms.\xc2\xa0 I think the easiest way to think about it is furloughed and non-furloughed employees.\xc2\xa0 And as I articulated, there are many services that are going to be shut down and some essential services will remain open.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Savannah.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain how the shutdown will cost ultimately the government money?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the ripple effects that Chip was talking about, but some have suggested that it actually will cost the government to shut down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, in some situations, oftentimes -- I alluded to this earlier -- when you have to shut something down, that costs money, and ramping something back up costs money.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the case here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s built into contractors.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s built into a lot of the different cost structures of the federal government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is that likely to be, and is that independent of the amount of time -- I mean, even for a couple of days if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to ramp down, you got to restart, there would be a cost associated with that.\xc2\xa0 How much is that likely --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We have not -- as to the actual government operations, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not sized that.\xc2\xa0 We will do so if indeed we reach that point.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an estimate for that.\xc2\xa0 Again, the cost on the economy I think is far greater, as I articulated earlier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question, do you have any estimates based on the last time that this happened, what it costs to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I do not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan to reimburse furloughed employees for lost pay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 As you know, in 1995, indeed, furloughed employees were paid.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but the administration will support reimbursement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ari.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If American people have specific questions about services, whether they will or will not be available, particularly if switchboards are shut down, is there any way for them to find out before they go to a government office whether that service will be there for them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult because, as you said, customer service lines are going to be down, 800 numbers are going to be down, many websites are going to be down, many websites are going to be at limited levels in terms of updating of information.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll count on all of you to help disseminate that information in the unfortunate event of a shutdown.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Helene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain just a little more for me the whole IRS part of this, because aren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of these IRS workers seasonal and isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a fear that after April 15th they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be available to do a lot of these tax returns anyway?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the composition of the IRS workforce, but to the extent there are seasonal workers, to go back to Savannah\xe2\x80\x99s question, there will be real transition costs if you were to not allow them to work because they\xe2\x80\x99re furloughed.\xc2\xa0 Presumably they would seek other employment and might not be available when the government reopens.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s again an example of the type of cost that we\xe2\x80\x99ll suffer for having to shut down and then reopen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So income tax returns could be delayed even more than --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think this is peak season.\xc2\xa0 And 30 percent of returns are paper-based, so if we were shut down during peak season we\xe2\x80\x99d have a significant backlog and then we\xe2\x80\x99d have the problem of ramping back up and dealing with that backlog.\xc2\xa0 So there could be significant delays.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you quantify at all the cost per day to the economy?\xc2\xa0 You said there will be an impact.\xc2\xa0 Have you guys put any numbers on this as far as beyond the payroll or other services that are affected?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We have not.\xc2\xa0 I think other economists have attempted to do so, but those are not numbers that we have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Let me not go to the specifics.\xc2\xa0 Let me not go the specifics of volunteering and fines, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know those.\xc2\xa0 Overall, this is governed by the Antideficiency Act, where violations of the Antideficiency Act are criminal violations.\xc2\xa0 So this stuff is very serious.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if we were to shut down at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday morning, those that are furloughed need to power down their BlackBerries and not do any work.\xc2\xa0 And those who are working cannot reach out to those employees for work purposes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, will Air Force One fly?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not speculating at all.\xc2\xa0 I mean, right now we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to make sure that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, as Jay has talked about, and if in the unfortunate scenario it happens that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to execute on the shutdown plans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 National emergency personnel are for the most part going to be at work, and some will be on call.\xc2\xa0 So we will be well positioned to deal with a national emergency.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But aren\xe2\x80\x99t there many other logistical issues that other agencies would have to pick up, I mean, if there\xe2\x80\x99s some kind of an attack?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 If something like that was to occur, agencies would look at the legal framework and how it\xe2\x80\x99s changed since they did their planning based on the circumstance and, therefore, would be able to bring back appropriate employees if necessary as dictated by the circumstance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do two more here.\xc2\xa0 Sam, and yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It might be out of your purview, but private contractors who work inside government buildings, do you have any models about how they\xe2\x80\x99ll be affected economically or in terms of their workload?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Same framework.\xc2\xa0 So if they\xe2\x80\x99re doing activities that come from multiyear funding or user fees, i.e., there are dollars to fund, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to execute on their contracts.\xc2\xa0 If they are part of these activities, protection of life or property, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise, they will not.\xc2\xa0 Those contracts will not be in place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In reaction to the Japan tsunami, what about U.S. relief efforts in Japan and elsewhere -- relief efforts abroad?\xc2\xa0 Would those continue?\xc2\xa0 And what about the radiation monitoring here in the continental United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I believe the monitoring would continue, and the specific relief efforts I think you need to follow up with the agencies.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a case-by-case situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about embassies and consulates?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Embassies and consulates will continue to operate at lower levels of service.\xc2\xa0 And I had mentioned earlier, only emergency passports; so regular passports and visas will not be processed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What classifies emergency passports?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 State Department could help you with that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff, what about the big dig out there?\xc2\xa0 Does that stop?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is there a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a national security --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a shining cloud, a shining light --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only infrastructure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the specifics of the big dig, but EOP has its plan, as I said earlier, and it will use -- it uses the exact same framework -- is there multiyear funding or not in this situation?\xc2\xa0 Clearly, it would not be a protection of life.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff, this is confusing for us, but what would you say to the rank-and-file worker who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting there wondering today, what\xe2\x80\x99s my status after Friday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99d say -- I very much sympathize.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a hard, hard, hard situation for people to operate with this level of uncertainty.\xc2\xa0 And so we have asked agencies to begin communicating to employees as to --if there is a shutdown, hoping again that there is not -- what their status will be.\xc2\xa0 Will they be furloughed or will they indeed be at work?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll move on.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it, Jeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 As I said at the top, I just want to warn you as you ask your questions that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of a very important meeting that\xe2\x80\x99s happening as we speak.\xc2\xa0 And with that admonition I will call on Mr. Feller.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Last night the President said from this room that the issues were narrowing.\xc2\xa0 Based on what Speaker Boehner and Leader Reid said today, it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like that; it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s going the other direction.\xc2\xa0 What happened since last night?\xc2\xa0 Where did this get off the rails?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, what I would say is, because they are in there discussing just these issues right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details about proposals and counterproposals, but I will say that at the very least, the meeting, the long meeting, 84-minute meeting last night in the Oval Office, did produce clarity about what the issues are and what the avenues would be to discussing and hopefully resolving them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we have said and what remains true is that, as I discussed earlier, that the numbers we have shown that we are willing to do, is end the debate about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about reducing spending.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it simply cannot be suggested that the President of the United States endorses a proposal to reduce discretionary -- non-defense discretionary spending by $73 billion, or overall spending by $73 billion in this measure, which is the largest nominal reduction, discretionary reduction, in history and the largest as a percentage of the economy since 1982, that that does not represent a serious commitment to reducing spending and reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is also -- there are some lines that the President has drawn about what are essential priorities that must be funded because of their significance to economic growth and our economic future.\xc2\xa0 He has also made clear that this is not the place -- and we believe the American people would broadly agree with this notion -- that this is not the place -- a funding measure, an appropriations measure for last year\xe2\x80\x99s business, for the remaining six months of this fiscal year -- is not the place to inject contentious ideological political agenda items.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Within those parameters, there is a great deal of room for a compromise, again, because we have shown ourselves willing to go -- meet the Republicans so much further than halfway because we agree on the importance of cutting spending and because we all agree that a government shutdown would be harmful.\xc2\xa0 It would cause great uncertainty in the economy.\xc2\xa0 Somebody asked how many days we would be planning for.\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- you know, how would we know?\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the uncertainty that\xe2\x80\x99s created since it\xe2\x80\x99s contingent upon a settlement, an agreement, among the political parties and a bill that passes Congress and is signed by the President.\xc2\xa0 So -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s in addition to all the ramifications that Jeff just outlined.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the leadership in the Congress has said they want to avert a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 The President has made very clear he wants to avert a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 The means by which we can achieve that are very clear.\xc2\xa0 And with any luck, an agreement will be reached and we will avoid that situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick ones.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the term \xe2\x80\x9cclarity,\xe2\x80\x9d but Leader Reid said today that there\xe2\x80\x99s essentially agreement on the numbers and you\xe2\x80\x99re down to these ideological policy issues.\xc2\xa0 And the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office is saying that as of this morning that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House stand?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I just outlined our stand in terms of where we have been and the fact that there was an agreement on $73 billion, which, by the way, is the same number in terms of the degree of spending cuts that was first put forward by the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee at the beginning of this process.\xc2\xa0 Remaining issues need to be worked out, and hopefully they will be because it will be awfully hard to explain why they -- why the issues that prevented that from happening were important enough to cause the kind of uncertainty and economic problems that would follow a government shutdown.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last one, quickly, as candidly as you can, does the President think that House Republicans genuinely want to solve this or does he think that they want a government shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is not interested in assigning motivation.\xc2\xa0 He believes that -- he takes the Speaker of the House at his word, Senate Minority Leader at his word, about their desire to avoid a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker of the House mentioned not that long ago that, as I think Savannah or someone -- Savannah brought up, that it would actually cost more to shut the government down than it would save money.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just leaving out the broader economic implications of this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a large body of lawmakers, so to guess at the motivations of individual lawmakers would be a pointless exercise.\xc2\xa0 What he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is negotiating with the leader of the House Republicans, and his team is negotiating with the relevant leaders of the process to try to reach a deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think she wanted --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You looked like you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to call on you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I was looking at my notes.\xc2\xa0 I definitely have a question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach in these meetings?\xc2\xa0 How specific is he getting on the details of the discussion?\xc2\xa0 Is he offering proposals on some of the most sensitive issues like Planned Parenthood and the environmental issues?\xc2\xa0 Or is he just telling the two sides, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot at stake, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to reach a deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without going into the details of a private meeting from last night or previous private meetings, or obviously the one that\xe2\x80\x99s happening now, I will simply say that he spent nearly an hour and a half in the room with leaders last night, so it was obviously a fairly detailed conversation.\xc2\xa0 Now, there were others in the room who are masters of the some of the arcane details, but he\xe2\x80\x99s very engaged.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he believes also that this is not that complicated, it simply is not that complicated, and that there are -- if we are reasonable, there are fairly clear and acceptable ways to get from here to there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he actually mediating in the sense of saying, look, you\xe2\x80\x99re this far apart on this issue; how about we do it this way?\xc2\xa0 Is he offering specifics in that way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- except to say that he is clearly very much engaged in this, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize the back and forth, because I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important to protect the privacy of those discussions in the name of hoping that by doing that we can help achieve a result.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While the President was working with congressional leaders throughout 2010, does he wish that he had asked them to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President was very hopeful at the end of last year that funding for the full year could have been achieved.\xc2\xa0 It was obviously a time with a lot on the table.\xc2\xa0 And there was, as you remember, an unexpected by most, I think, observers and very significant bipartisan agreement on a tax cut compromise and further measures to help advance the recovery that was taking hold last year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he -- he obviously fully supports and has always supported the idea that Congress would get its work done and move forward.\xc2\xa0 But these are complicated issues -- or they can be.\xc2\xa0 What is the case on this, is that we have been focused on this portion of the fiscal year now for many, many weeks.\xc2\xa0 We have -- the President has signed into law already several extensions, continuing resolutions with significant spending cuts contained within them in order to allow more time to get -- to reach a compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is -- we are well past time for that to take place.\xc2\xa0 It is -- the issues that confront us here at the White House and on Capitol Hill are too large to continue to linger over this negotiation, because we should just get a deal and move on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I interviewed a number of people who will be hurt by a government shutdown; President Obama cited one of them last night.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really sense that they care much about whether or not the President is fed up with the number of continuing resolutions.\xc2\xa0 I think they just want to be able to get their tax refunds and their military pay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And my guess is that they\xe2\x80\x99re fed up with the noise they hear from Washington when they find out that they\xe2\x80\x99re -- in the scope of the size of the economy and the distance of their differences, that Washington can\xe2\x80\x99t simply get this done and be reasonable.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we simply say -- and obviously we rely on those who hear us speak and write about our positions -- we believe we have been, the President has been very reasonable and demonstrated a significant willingness to find common ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what I would say --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I finish my question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- let me finish my answer, then you can finish your question.\xc2\xa0 But the -- he entirely sympathizes, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why he cited the gentleman that you referenced, with the uncertainty this creates.\xc2\xa0 It should not be this way.\xc2\xa0 It does not need to be this way.\xc2\xa0 And passing a continuing resolution for another week so we can kick the can down the field a little further without focusing on what we can get done now does not add to the certainty that the economy needs or that individuals need.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but my point would be I think that they --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is a question, not a debate, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 What I want to know is, what would the President say if somebody says, wait a second, you mean you actually -- the Republicans are offering another short-term resolution so I will get paid next week, but you just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sign it because you\xe2\x80\x99re fed up with the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President supports a clean -- an essentially -- a simple continuing resolution that would allow that to happen --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it isn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to allow -- includes $12 billion in additional spending cuts which then -- there are already $73 billion in the proposal on the table from the President and the Democrats -- and muddies the issue, again, when we are on the verge of a potential compromise.\xc2\xa0 So we are focused on the work at hand today and we believe that it can get done.\xc2\xa0 We believe the American people want it done.\xc2\xa0 We take the leaders of Congress at their word that they want it done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s in there now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you mentioned that the President said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that this is that complicated.\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s very complicated if they can\xe2\x80\x99t reach an agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, is that a question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s part question, part statement.\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it complicated?\xc2\xa0 Because to this point --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there have been all these meetings and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined and I think the President has and others have that we have a situation where in the beginning of this process the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee proposed a funding bill for the rest of fiscal year 2011 which would have -- which called for $73 billion in spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Through this process, they then -- the House then decided that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough and passed a resolution with $100 billion in spending cuts -- $100 billion plus -- based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposed 2011 budget.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Democrats have come -- and the President -- have come from that starting point, the same starting point if you put it at zero, to $73 billion.\xc2\xa0 And in any definition of meeting the Republicans more than halfway, I think we have -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve met that and exceeded it.\xc2\xa0 Spending cuts are the issue.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have made that clear and we agree that spending cuts are important.\xc2\xa0 The President has demonstrated his commitment to reducing spending.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what we have left now is a debate about a relatively small number and how you compose those cuts, and whether or not, for example, you reduce funding for Head Start for children or you eliminate spending for highway projects that are earmarked -- that are designated for earmarks; whether you cut funding for medical research or you cut funding that the Pentagon has deemed wasteful and unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 Those are some of the choices.\xc2\xa0 When we talk about getting the composition of the numbers, those are really the choices on the table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At another level, there are these issues -- this issue of the injection of policy matters that are highly contentious and should be debated on their own precisely because they\xe2\x80\x99re highly contentious, and do not belong in a funding bill because the insertion of them in there is precisely designed to inject politics in a process that the American people do not want politics injected into.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no agreement on a number?\xc2\xa0 Or is there agreement on a number?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, they\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating now.\xc2\xa0 What I will tell you is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, last night, did they have an agreement last night on a number?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize anything more than what was said by the President in terms of last night\xe2\x80\x99s discussions.\xc2\xa0 What we have said, and I know anybody who has sources on the Hill can confirm, that there was an agreement on a target of $73 billion for the appropriators to work off of to try to find a way to a deal.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been true now for more -- well more than a week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to understand, are you saying the President will not support any one-week unclean CR even if that\xe2\x80\x99s the only choice other than a shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, you\xe2\x80\x99re setting up straw men because we believe these negotiations should bear -- can and we hope will bear fruit.\xc2\xa0 And I have simply said that the President has made clear that he will sign a short-term extension if it is simple and for the purpose of facilitating the conclusion of an agreement reached on the rest of the fiscal year; not so he can start the process all over again, move the goal post a little further, reopen everything, and hope we get there in a week.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not acceptable for the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the way to run a business and it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way to run government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it have to be perfectly clean --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate with you, Chip.\xc2\xa0 We put out a statement, a pretty clear statement.\xc2\xa0 And more importantly, there are important conversations happening in the Oval Office right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other.\xc2\xa0 Reid, Durbin, and Schumer are just repeatedly taking shot after shot at the Tea Party, blaming them for being the problem here.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that assessment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, again, is focused on the conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s having with the leaders of the House and the Senate and the appropriations committees, and his staff is working with relevant staff and members to try to get this done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not characterizing motivations, he just simply thinks that the American people broadly expect their leaders in Washington to work it out; to have in the way that they reach a solution the same kind of approach that most of us have when we resolve a problem, and that is to give a little, compromise, and accept a good deal on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 But, again, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have more for this to say, obviously, about this as the afternoon continues.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I encourage us not to dwell too much longer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell and then Carol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly said that the President has gone more than halfway.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to some liberals who say he\xe2\x80\x99s already given up too much?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that the President made clear with his fiscal year 2012 budget and with his positions in this process that he has been willing, in the name of reaching common ground and in recognition of the fact that spending -- reducing spending is important, to accept cuts that in an ideal world he would hope would not be necessary because they are cuts to -- in some cases, to programs that he thinks are very worthy and would merit fuller funding if we did not all need to tighten our belts and share the sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s his position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could try again with Karen\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Majority Leader Reid said today, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have bent and bent as much as the President will let us bend.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating here?\xc2\xa0 Is it the President and Boehner?\xc2\xa0 Is it Reid and Boehner?\xc2\xa0 Is it a three-way --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In the room last night, there was the President of the United States, Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s who was in the room -- and the Vice President, and obviously relevant staff.\xc2\xa0 But the appropriations chairs are significantly engaged because this is an appropriations bill.\xc2\xa0 And as are -- everybody obviously then talks to and gets input from the people in their committee, caucus, or staff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a congressional matter, no question.\xc2\xa0 It obviously is very much of concern to the President because of his priorities, and because of the potential damage that could be caused by a shutdown of government -- to the economy and to individuals.\xc2\xa0 So he is very engaged in this process as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there just two sides, though?\xc2\xa0 The President and the Majority Leader of the Senate totally on the same page here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President and, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said I think three or four times, the Democrats have presented a position that represents $73 billion in reductions, in spending reductions.\xc2\xa0 And that is a position they share.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Savannah -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s -- probably just a couple more.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this veto threat that you\xe2\x80\x99ve issued, essentially it reflects a judgment that this one-week budget extension is worse than a government shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Savannah, look, you can parse it in a lot of ways.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that if we can focus on getting a deal on the rest of the year, the President will sign a measure that allows for a very short period of time to get that process done.\xc2\xa0 If we have an agreement and there is a day or two or three or a few more days necessary<br/>\n\tto push that pig through the python, then you do that.\xc2\xa0 But you do not continue the cycle that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been on, because it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten us to conclusion.\xc2\xa0 It has created more uncertainty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just so people understand, the cycle you describe -- you have judged, the President has judged -- that cycle is worse than a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99d rather see a government shutdown.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He does not believe -- no.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that a shutdown is necessary and that we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- if everyone is serious about getting a compromise and finding common ground, then they will do that in these negotiations, and they will, if necessary, agree that in order to get an agreement through the end of the year, they will support a simple \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d CR for several days to allow that to happen.\xc2\xa0 It is not necessary to start all over again when we are so close to getting it done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Haven\xe2\x80\x99t the Republicans kind of out-maneuvered you, because if it gets to the point where the Republicans pass a one-week extension and the President is going to veto it as he\xe2\x80\x99s promised --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Savannah, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- then he\xe2\x80\x99s the person that\xe2\x80\x99s the instrument of the government shutting down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
