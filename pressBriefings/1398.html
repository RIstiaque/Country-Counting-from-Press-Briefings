EST</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for coming.\xc2\xa0 I know you were up late watching the Oscars.\xc2\xa0 A couple of facts about the event when we hit the ground -- everybody up rolling?\xc2\xa0 A couple details about the event:\xc2\xa0 1,800 folks will be in attendance.\xc2\xa0 The event was free and open to the public, but tickets were required.\xc2\xa0 They were mostly handed out by the school, and then also a small number to local groups and officials.</p>\n<p>The President will be introduced by a woman named Leslie Banks, who wrote the President recently about issues that she\'s been having with health care, specifically rate increases.\xc2\xa0 And then after the event, we will head back to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And with that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he take questions at the event?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, he won\'t take questions.\xc2\xa0 We\'re just going to get back on the plane and come back to Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what he hopes to accomplish in these trips that he\'s taking today and on Wednesday?\xc2\xa0 There\'s so little time before he goes on his trip overseas and he wants to get a bill by then.\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to accomplish in this short time?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is trying to make the stakes of this issue very clear to the American people.\xc2\xa0 In Washington, the event -- the issues are all about who\'s up, who\'s down, what impact is this going to have on the elections, what is it going to do to help people politically or not.\xc2\xa0 But out in the country, like in Philadelphia, as you\'ll hear today, people are being punished by these rising health care costs.\xc2\xa0 It\'s hurting businesses; it\'s hurting our government.</p>\n<p>So the President is going to talk about the urgency of getting something done right now and hopefully get across what a lot of us have known for a long time, which is that health insurance companies have made the decision that even with rising health care costs and pricing people out of health care, they can still make more money by increasing their rates than they can by keeping people on the rolls.</p>\n<p>So it\'s an unfortunate situation and brings real urgency to the situation with this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, is there any strategic significance or political significance to choosing Pennsylvania or Missouri?\xc2\xa0 In other words, is he going to specific congressional House districts to make a point or encourage grassroots support for the bill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t say that this is about any specific targeting in that sense.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you look at where we\'re going, it doesn\'t really have an impact on a particular member.\xc2\xa0 But Philadelphia is a place where they are seeing these rising costs really crush their -- crush families and businesses and local government.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s really why the President is going to Pennsylvania and Missouri.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow, can you talk to us a bit about the President\'s meeting later today in the Oval Office with Senator Schumer and Graham on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\'s as simple as getting an update from them on efforts to create bipartisan immigration legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In their meeting tomorrow, what will Obama tell the Greek Prime Minister the U.S. can do to help, and how concerned is the U.S. about the spreading, about problems in Greece spreading to other countries?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Let me get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of what the President is going to say to the Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And any update on Federal Reserve appointees to the board?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No new update.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve said, the goal is to make sure that there is an appointment before June and we\'re confident that we\'re going to be able to meet that deadline.\xc2\xa0 But no decisions have been made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any idea of when an announcement will be made?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Before June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Pakistan, what has the President been updated on in terms of this American that\'s been detained there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\'t confirmed any detainments, and I would refer you to the Pakistani government for information about individuals that they\'ve detained.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been getting updates, though, on these reports that it could have been Gadahn and now they\'ve backed off that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I assure you that the President gets regular updates about what intelligence there is about people who are detained and what\'s happening in the fight against extremists all over the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then back to health care quickly.\xc2\xa0 Is this tour going to continue next week?\xc2\xa0 Should we expect more stops around the country on health care?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up on the Fed.\xc2\xa0 The goal is to get a nominee before Kohn leaves.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on health care, he\'s been talking a lot about the premiums.\xc2\xa0 Is that the main focus now, is how it affects people and their premiums?\xc2\xa0 Or is he going to move to a different topic on Wednesday, a different aspect of this?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You\'ll see the President talk about a lot of the different aspects of this issue.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a problem for Americans for a variety of issues -- from the rising cost of premiums, to the fact that people are getting priced out of health care, to the insurance reforms that are so desperately needed because people with preexisting conditions can\'t get health insurance, people who get sick are getting kicked off their health insurance.\xc2\xa0 So you\'ll see the President talk about some of the different elements.</p>\n<p>This Goldman report obviously brings a real illustration of the kinds of business decisions that are being made that are really hurting the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about this meeting tomorrow with the Greek Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0 I mean, why is he coming; what are they going to talk about -- just any background.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We will have more on this later today.\xc2\xa0 You know, it is Greek Independence Day this week.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is a key ally.\xc2\xa0 We share a lot of issues of mutual concern and we have a long history with the Greek people, and obviously there\'s a lot to talk about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that the economy, I mean, particularly in Greece?\xc2\xa0 That\'s got to be the major --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, of course, economic issues will be an important part of the discussion, but I\'m not going to get ahead of their conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, really quick, does the White House thinks it\'s appropriate for the RNC to use images of the President as a Joker from Batman to raise money?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I understand that the individual who put this presentation together is under a lot of pressure to raise a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has raise half a million dollars just to make his own payroll.\xc2\xa0 So I think that you see things happening in the political season all the time.\xc2\xa0 But whether or not Michael Steele and the rest of Republican leadership thinks it\'s appropriate is a question for them.</p>\n<p>I saw that Mitch McConnell distanced himself from it yesterday and I think we may have really found an issue where the President and Mitch McConnell agree.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the RNC needs to come out a little -- more strongly in terms of what it -- whether they think it\'s appropriate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I mean, what Michael Steele decides to do with that individual and what the members of the RNC decide to do is really up to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n10:31 A.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
