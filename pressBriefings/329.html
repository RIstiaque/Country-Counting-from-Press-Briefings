Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:04 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Sorry for the brief delay in getting started today.\xc2\xa0 Let me just mention one thing that I think many of you are already aware of.\xc2\xa0 But today, the President has selected Mr. Joseph Clancy to serve as the permanent director of the United States Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 Director Clancy, who is a 27-year veteran of the agency and a former Special Agent in Charge of the Presidential Protective Division, has served as the Acting Director since October 1st of last year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Many of you will recall that Director Clancy stepped into that roll at the special request of the President at a rather difficult time for the agency.\xc2\xa0 And over the course of the last several months, Director Clancy has demonstrated the kind of leadership that, frankly, many of us expected him to demonstrate.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody that has, based on his long track record with the agency, a lot of credibility built up inside the agency, and he used that credibility to put in place reforms that were recommended by this outside panel that DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson had convened.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of important work still ahead of him, but we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly pleased to see that his leadership thus far has been recognized with this permanent appointment.</p>\n<p>So with that, Jim, do you want to get us started on questions?\xc2\xa0 And I do have a pretty hard out at 2:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 So if you can help me stay on time, I would appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your announcement, Josh -- when the outside group that reviewed and made recommendations for the Secret Service recommended fairly strongly that the White House hire outside, or this administration hire an outsider for this job.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it stated that, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a director from outside the Secret Service, removed from organizational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why did the President stick with Mr. Clancy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99d point out a couple things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is, anytime you\xe2\x80\x99re making a personnel decision like this, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to weigh somebody\xe2\x80\x99s personal attachments inside the agency with their ability to take a cold-eyed assessment of what actually needs to be changed in that agency so that they can live up to the high standards that they have set for themselves.</p>\n<p>And Mr. Clancy, over the last several months, has demonstrated that he was willing to conduct a candid, clear-eyed assessment of the shortcomings of that agency and to look at needed reforms and implement them.\xc2\xa0 And that precisely is why he has been promoted to this permanent role.</p>\n<p>His willingness to use his credibility within the agency to implement these reforms in some ways is the best of both worlds.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not just the assessment of the President, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually also the assessment of at least one member of this outside panel.\xc2\xa0 Tom Perrelli, who you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall was a senior Justice Department official earlier in the administration, said that \xe2\x80\x9cActing Director Clancy is a dedicated public servant who\xe2\x80\x99s made important changes since he began the job, and has started the process of reforming the Service.\xc2\xa0 I look forward to working with him as he continues to implement the panel\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear indication that at least one member of the panel, who has spent a lot of time thinking about what kinds of changes are needed at the agency, recognized that Mr. Clancy was the right person for the job because he had the kind of credibility within the organization to implement successfully the kinds of changes that at least this outside panel believes are necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President consider other candidates, or was Mr. Clancy, once he became Acting Director, essentially going through a job review to see if he could carry out and become permanent?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into sort of the inner workings of this personnel process, but I can tell you that it was not at all a foregone conclusion that when Mr. Clancy was given the acting position, that he would necessarily be asked to stay on as the permanent director.\xc2\xa0 But certainly his solid performance over the last several months in implementing needed changes at the agency I think certainly served him well as he was considered for that position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration limiting the amount of information that it\xe2\x80\x99s giving to Israel regarding the Iran nuclear talks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen some reports to that effect, and I know that there were some initial reports that indicated that the United States was no longer communicating with our allies in Israel about the ongoing negotiations with Iran.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is false.\xc2\xa0 There are any number of meetings that have taken place in recent weeks and are scheduled for the weeks ahead that indicate the continued close communication and coordination between U.S. national security officials and their Israeli counterparts.</p>\n<p>For example, I can tell you that Phil Gordon, who\xe2\x80\x99s the White House Coordinator for the Middle East at the National Security Council, met on Monday with Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Minister of Intelligence.\xc2\xa0 The focus of that discussion was principally on the Iran negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, here at the White House, maintains regular contact with her Israeli counterpart, Yossi Cohen.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, I understand that Mr. Cohen is actually expected to be at the White House later this week for consultations with Dr. Rice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can tell you that the Under Secretary of State, Wendy Sherman, who is the sort of principal negotiator for the United States in these talks with the P5+1 in Iran, has repeatedly met with the Israeli National Security Advisor as well as the Israeli Minister of Intelligence on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 And those kinds of consultations are going to continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been very clear about the fact that the United States is not going to be in a position of negotiating this agreement in public, and particularly when we see that there is a continued practice of cherry picking specific pieces of information and using them out of context to distort the negotiating position of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So there is an obligation when you\xe2\x80\x99re participating in these kinds of negotiations to ensure that those consultations and that those negotiations are carried out in good faith.\xc2\xa0 And that means giving negotiators the room and the space to negotiate.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, I can tell you that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- that at least based on one assessment that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard -- there\xe2\x80\x99s probably, I would acknowledge, not a real precise way to quantify this, but I think you could arguably make the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s no country that is not participating in the negotiations that has greater insight into what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at that negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not a coincidence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You could also make a pretty strong case that there is no nation who is not represented in those negotiations who has a clearer stake in the outcome of these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s principally why -- I guess not principally why, but it\'s an important reason why the President has pursued this diplomatic opening.\xc2\xa0 The principal reason is because he believes it\'s clearly in the national security interest of the United States of America for Iran not to obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the most effective way for us to do that is to get the Iranian regime to voluntarily, and in a verifiable way, give up their pursuit of a nuclear weapon and make it clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to obtain a nuclear weapon, and put in place a monitoring regime to ensure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t acquire one.</p>\n<p>And that is the goal of these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 The United States has a clear stake in this outcome, but so does Israel, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult with them about these talks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are consulting, but you are worried about cherry picking?\xc2\xa0 So does that still limit the information that you provide during those consultations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I obviously am not going to be able to get into the details of those conversations, I think for obvious reasons, but I think it is fair to say that the United States is mindful of the need to not negotiate in public and ensure that information that\xe2\x80\x99s discussed at the negotiating table is not taken out of context and publicized in a way that distorts a negotiating position of the United States and our allies.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you think that distortion and cherry picking has occurred -- has been done by the Israelis?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that some of the things that the Israelis have said in characterizing our negotiating position have not been accurate.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question on the immigration lawsuit.\xc2\xa0 How does that decision by Judge Hanen affect the DHS funding debate in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s mind?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In our mind, all along we have made clear that the Republican leadership in the United States Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is properly funded.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say on a couple of occasions it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that there is a good time to muck around in the funding of the Department of Homeland Security, but now seems like a particularly bad time to do it.</p>\n<p>And the other thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out is that Senator McConnell himself indicated at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year that Republicans finally had an opportunity to demonstrate that they could be what he described as a responsible right-of-center governing majority.\xc2\xa0 It is completely irresponsible to allow a political dispute to interfere with the ability of the United States Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it certainly is not going to be good for the ongoing efforts to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t fair to the hundreds of thousands of Department of Homeland Security employees who a couple weeks from now may be facing the prospect of going to work to keep the country safe but not getting a paycheck for it.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem fair and it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the best interest of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in terms of this lawsuit, I mean, first of all, will the administration seek an immediate emergency stay of that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our legal strategy going forward is something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be determined by the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that in the next couple of days they\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about how we will pursue that strategy.\xc2\xa0 But that strategy will certainly include an appeal of this ruling because we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair, accurate reading of the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you could proceed with an appeal and the injunction would remain in place so that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to implement the program.\xc2\xa0 So why not wait until the whole process is completed before you --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising are exactly the kinds of questions that the attorneys at the Department of Justice are considering right now.\xc2\xa0 And within the next couple of days, I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information about the way forward here</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President said yesterday that DHS will still be preparing to implement this program because he believes that the administration will prevail in court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of how long this is going to take?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is another question for the attorneys at the Department of Justice to evaluate, is what is the strategy that we can pursue that will resolve this legal process as soon as possible because we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that when this is resolved in the legal system that the position of the government, the position of the administration will prevail.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s because the steps that the President announced at the end of last year are entirely consistent with the kinds of steps that previous Presidents have taken -- previous Presidents of both parties I might add.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re confident that there is a solid precedent here, there is a solid legal foundation for the actions that the President announced.\xc2\xa0 More importantly, we\'re confident that the actions the President announced are the right thing for the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for the millions of people who were getting ready to apply and are now sort of in limbo, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way of telling them how long that\'s going to last?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly would hope that we can move as quickly as we can through the legal system so that that situation can be resolved and that we can move forward with implementing a set of decisions that are, again, clearly consistent with the law and clearly in the best interest of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other topics.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the foreign policy team that was announced by Jeb Bush and his campaign today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You sure?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was hoping you would.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, what does the White House make of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Argentina?\xc2\xa0 A prosecutor has died who was bringing up some issues against the President.\xc2\xa0 The opponents are charging that the government is interfering with the judiciary.\xc2\xa0 And now Argentina has reached out to the United States, asking them -- asking Washington to bring up claims up about Iran and killings there in its negotiations.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your take on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, I think just as a topline matter, I can convey to you that obviously the nation of Argentina is a significant economy and a significant player in our sort of relations throughout the Americas.\xc2\xa0 The President has on a number of occasions, or at least on a couple of previous occasions had the opportunity to meet with the leader of Argentina because there are deep ties between our countries.</p>\n<p>We certainly are concerned any time that in a country like Argentina, with whom we have a strong relationship, where questions are raised about the rule of law and of justice.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have anything specific to say about sort of where things stand in that process, or whether or not there is an appropriate role for the U.S. government to play in all of that.\xc2\xa0 But it is certainly something that we continue to monitor closely.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of the way in which we value the relationship between the United States and Argentina.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it hurting your relationship?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who may be a better or more close observer of U.S.-Argentina relations who could answer that question.\xc2\xa0 At this point, this continues to be a situation that we\'re going to monitor.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around.\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Back on the Secret Service, now that you\'ve named Joe Clancy as the head -- the permanent head, could you talk to us about what has transpired since the firing of the former head of the Secret Service and the firings of the top tiers of a lot of the people in the Secret Service?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I could tell you that you named some of the specific reforms that Director Clancy has implemented since taking over the leadership of that agency.\xc2\xa0 And again, this all occurred within the last few months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Since taking office as the Acting Director, Mr. Clancy has conducted a comprehensive, top-to-bottom assessment to determine the root cause behind the recent shortcomings in the agency.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s directed all personnel who -- all Secret Service personnel who operate on the White House grounds to undergo additional classroom and practical training.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s sought additional funding for training and equipment for Secret Service personnel.\xc2\xa0 And as you mentioned, he swiftly implemented some of the personnel changes that were recommended by the blue-ribbon panel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you quantify the number of firings that happened?\xc2\xa0 Because I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing that there was quite few.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the specific numbers in front of me, but you can certainly check with the Secret Service, and they may be able to give you some more information about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But this is consistent with what Director Clancy has also done in terms of trying to engage more deeply with rank-and-file officers throughout the agency.\xc2\xa0 After all, we\'re talking about men and women who on a regular basis are willing to put their lives on the line to protect the President and the First Family, to protect the White House grounds, and to protect all of us who work here on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are appreciative of their service.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what that agency has done is set a very high standard of service and professionalism.\xc2\xa0 And there have been some instances where they\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen short, even by their own acknowledgement.\xc2\xa0 And Director Clancy has to do the very important work of ensuring that that agency, and the men and women who serve in that agency, live up to that very high standard.\xc2\xa0 And certainly those of us who have had an opportunity to watch Director Clancy as he\xe2\x80\x99s done his job understand that he holds himself to a very high standard of professionalism, and we certainly would anticipate that his style of leadership will have a positive effect on the agency, and that he will continue to implement the reforms that are needed to ensure that they live up to that high standard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you on another issue?\xc2\xa0 On immigration reform, since the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in Texas, we understand that immigration is not just about one group of people in this country, it\xe2\x80\x99s about different groups of people in this country.\xc2\xa0 How does this ruling affect particularly African and Caribbean immigrants coming into this country?\xc2\xa0 Because the NAACP and many other organizations worked with many Hispanic organizations to help push through immigration reform; they said they had a stake.\xc2\xa0 So what does this do for African and Caribbean immigrants as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess there are a couple of things about this most recent court ruling, April, that are important for people to keep in mind.\xc2\xa0 The first is that it does not apply to the action that the President took back in 2012 to grant some relief to DREAMers.\xc2\xa0 These are immigrants of this country who came to this country as children; they were raised essentially as Americans -- American in every way except their papers.\xc2\xa0 And the ruling does not apply to that exercise of executive action.</p>\n<p>The ruling also does not apply to the direction that our law enforcement officers have received from the Secretary of Homeland Security about prosecutorial discretion.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that the President feels strongly about, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the agency use their limited resources to focus on those who pose the most prominent threat to communities across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This means that law enforcement officials at the Department of Homeland Security, and particularly as it relates to the agencies that handle immigration, that they\xe2\x80\x99re focused on people who might pose a threat to national security, people who are involved in conducting -- or people who have been involved in criminal activity.\xc2\xa0 Essentially, that the actions of those law enforcement agencies should be focused on felons, not on families.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that will remain in place even after this most recent court ruling.</p>\n<p>But I think some of the questions and issues that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising, April, can be best addressed by Congress actually taking the kind of legislative action that\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue, and that\xe2\x80\x99s legislative action that would bring about common-sense, bipartisan reform to our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And that means not just dealing with the millions of people who currently live in the shadows, but also putting in place some much needed reforms of our legal immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And that is why, even though the President has taken these executive actions that will have a positive impact on the immigration system, will have a positive impact on our economy, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to call on Congress to take the steps that only they can take to address some of these problems.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the ACA, you got 11.4 million people.\xc2\xa0 But in that number, did you get the minority groups that you wanted to focus it on?\xc2\xa0 This White House made a really strong push for African Americans and for Hispanics.\xc2\xa0 Did you get those numbers that you were looking for in this latest enrollment period?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, the more granular detail about the numbers included in this latest enrollment period will be available later from HHS.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that they\xe2\x80\x99ve crunched the numbers in that way.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that in the last enrollment period we did have some success in driving down the uninsured rate in the African American and Latino community, much as we did among people all across the country.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that one of the most important steps that we could see states take that would have an impact on these numbers would be for the remaining states that have blocked Medicaid expansion to follow through and actually expand Medicaid to cover a whole lot more people -- not just African Americans and Latinos, but Americans of all races.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly would have a very positive impact in trying to drive down the uninsured rate in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- quantify the number, you said (inaudible) number?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that they reduced the uninsured rate in the last enrollment period by 6.8 percent in the African American community, and 7.7 percent in the Latino community.\xc2\xa0 And when we have updated numbers, we\xe2\x80\x99ll release them.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about the ISIS beheadings in Libya.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction?\xc2\xa0 And to what extent are you concerned about ISIS in Libya?\xc2\xa0 Where does this fit into the broader fight against ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, there was a statement that we put out from the President over the weekend, responding to this situation.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, in general, that we strongly support the efforts of the United Nations and the Special Representative to the Secretary General to facilitate formation of a national unity government and bring a political solution to the ongoing political security and institutional crisis in that country.</p>\n<p>What we have seen, Kristen, is that we have seen extremists try to capitalize on instability in a country to carry out acts of violence.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that is why we continue to be concerned about the situation in Libya, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also why we believe that the best way to get the situation in Libya under control is to try to stabilize a representative central government in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a special representative from the United Nations that\xe2\x80\x99s working on that task right now, and we are strongly supportive of his efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And have you been in contact with -- have top officials here been in contact with their counterparts in Egypt?\xc2\xa0 And is there any discussion about sending aid, support -- military support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations specifically to read out.\xc2\xa0 The President was pretty forceful in condemning those killings, not just over the weekend, but also including in the op-ed that was published in the L.A. Times today.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly have an important military-to-military relationship with the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 They play an important role in some of our counterterrorism activities in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of any specific conversations or any specific requests have been made, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you bring up the President\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed.\xc2\xa0 One of the criticisms of this summit is that it is dealing with the root causes of violent extremism.\xc2\xa0 Does it need to deal with the situation on the ground more, and actually the strategy of the United States and its Western partners and Arab partners?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Kristen.\xc2\xa0 The summit that we\xe2\x80\x99ve convened over the course of this week is not a summit to discuss our comprehensive strategy to eradicate extremists who pose harm to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We do have a strategy for that, and one component of that strategy is ensuring that we are countering violent extremism; that we want to mitigate the ability of extremists to capitalize on social media to try to recruit others to their cause.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there are other critically important elements of our strategy, not the least of which is the military strategy that this President has led.\xc2\xa0 The best example of that is the success we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in wiping extremist terrorist leaders off the battlefield in every place from Pakistan to Yemen to Somalia, to even Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 So there is a military strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A couple of months ago I invited David Cohen, the Under Secretary of the Treasury -- or the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury -- I think I just gave him a promotion -- to come and talk about our efforts to counter financing of terrorist organizations, including ISIL, and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that being able to shut off their financing is a critical way that we can reduce their ability to fund their ongoing efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are there any tangibles that can come out of this summit, Josh?\xc2\xa0 Or is this more of a meeting of the minds and to discuss different ideas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the way that you phrased your question, that those two things aren\xe2\x80\x99t mutually exclusive.\xc2\xa0 I think there will be a number of things that are important about this summit.\xc2\xa0 I think the thing that I find most interesting is that there are already, in local communities across this country, coordinated efforts to counter extremist messaging that\xe2\x80\x99s aimed at vulnerable youth in communities across this country.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear in the context of this summit from law enforcement, political and community leaders, from Boston, Minneapolis and Los Angeles.\xc2\xa0 These are three communities that have devoted significant time and effort to trying to counter that radical messaging in communities in their cities.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that they can talk about some of the success that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had and to the extent that local leaders in other communities can apply those lessons in those communities -- I think those are real, tangible results and real, tangible ideas that other leaders can employ to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re protecting people in their communities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quickly on DHS.\xc2\xa0 It seems like a likely resolution to the funding problem is a short-term extension of DHS funding.\xc2\xa0 Would the President sign that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anybody knows exactly what the outcome of this situation is going to be.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we just saw the Speaker of the House go on television over the weekend and declare that he was certainly comfortable with not funding the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what kind of analysis leads you to that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not in the best interest of the country and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s really in the best interest of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s political calculation, at least one that I can see.\xc2\xa0 But, yet, he said it nonetheless, and I think that does raise some questions about whether or not this new governing Republican majority in Congress is committed to actually being responsible and acting in the best interest of the American people.</p>\n<p>One of the things that Senator McConnell said at the end of last year was that one of his goals was to make sure that Republican leadership didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear scary to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And when I saw that, I came out here and had a little fun with that, that he was setting the bar really low.\xc2\xa0 It looks like right now congressional Republicans are prepared to wiggle underneath that bar.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what if it emerges as a short-term extension, would the President sign it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see what emerges out of this process.\xc2\xa0 What clearly should emerge is a clear plan from congressional Republicans to fund the Department of Homeland Security before the impending deadline.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, let me pick up right there.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t get an agreement on funding for Department of Homeland Security and there\xe2\x80\x99s a partial shutdown of the department, will this be a national security risk?\xc2\xa0 In other words, will American be less safe if Congress cannot come up with an agreement to fund the department?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Department of Homeland Security has put out some specific information about the impact that this would have on their operation, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 But let me just say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is anybody who would be comfortable with making the case that refusing to pay our men and women on the frontlines of Homeland Security actually enhances our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, and the reason why I asked the question is because obviously I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at the information the department has put out, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a large number of essential employees, that most of them will actually still be going to work.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to gauge how big a threat, or is it a threat, to the safety of Americans if this funding agreement is not reached.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who can stand here and make the case that it would be good for our national security.\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be good for our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will you make the case that it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for our national security, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a risk here that we could -- a greater risk of a terrorist attack?\xc2\xa0 Or not protecting --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would leave it to the Department of Homeland Security to sort of offer up a specific assessment about the impact that this would have.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who could make the case that it would be good, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who could make the case that it would be fair.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President gave a State of the Union speech that was focused on middle-class economics.\xc2\xa0 And he talked about a wide range of things that we can do to strengthen the middle class in this country.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is, people who are working for the Transportation Security Administration and trying to safeguard our airports, those are good middle-class jobs.\xc2\xa0 Those are also American patriots.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m surprised that we would have congressional Republicans who are suggesting that they should go ahead and go to work and do it without getting a paycheck.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can I get you to respond to what the Speaker of the House said on this?\xc2\xa0 He makes the case that the House has passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security; that that bill is now before the Senate, that it is Senate Democrats that are filibustering that bill.\xc2\xa0 Would you respond to that?\xc2\xa0 And would you encourage the Senate Democrats to drop their filibuster so that the bill can be passed, and then you can have negotiations the old-fashioned way -- how a bill becomes a law? I mean, in fact, the Speaker said this probably 10 times in that interview, that the House has passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they passed a bill that won\xe2\x80\x99t pass the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because Democrats are filibustering it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t support a piece of legislation that would actually undo the kinds of administrative reforms that the President has put in place to solve our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing:\xc2\xa0 If Republicans want to have a negotiation about trying to fix our broken immigration system, we would welcome the opportunity to have that negotiation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to talk to them about immigration reform for, literally, for years.\xc2\xa0 We had a good conversation about that with Democrats and Republicans of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 We actually got a bipartisan piece of legislation that congressional Republicans blocked for more than a year and a half.</p>\n<p>So, again, I\'m not really sure exactly what the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s point is.\xc2\xa0 I would assume that his point would be that he understands the responsibility that he has for making sure the Department of Homeland Security is funded.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that he\xe2\x80\x99ll get that done before the deadline.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And one other very different topic.\xc2\xa0 I wanted ask you about a report in the Wall Street Journal that the President has received communications back from the Ayatollah in Iran -- two letters back, one in 2009, and another just in the past few weeks.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 John, I\'m going to decline to get into any sort of specifics about conversations that the President may have had -- or communications the President may have had with the leaders of the Iranian regime.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what our priority is there.\xc2\xa0 And our top priority is resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a long list of other concerns that the United States has with the way that the Iranian regime has supported terrorism around the globe; the way that they continue to promote anti-Semitism and even to wish ill on our allies in Israel.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a long list of concerns that we have with the Iranian regime, but the conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re having right now about trying to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program, right now is what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.</p>\n<p>Let me just also say one thing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also concerned about the status of a handful of Americans that are currently being detained in Iran wrongly and against their will.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work for the release of those Americans as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry, Jon, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Josh, the President himself has acknowledged in the past that he has written to Ayatollah Khamenei.\xc2\xa0 So all I\'m asking you is if you can confirm whether or not the Ayatollah has responded back to the President.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not asking you to give me details on that letter.\xc2\xa0 Can you at least confirm that the President is in receipt of a letter or letters in response to what we know that the President has written?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to do that from here, but let me see if I can get you some more information on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, to follow up on that, eventually -- I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of negotiations, you want to keep this correspondence confidential -- but will you commit to eventually releasing those letters?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s of great interest whether or not the leader -- the real leader of Iran, somebody who considers the United States the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat Satan,\xe2\x80\x9d whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s been a letter chain back and forth with the President.\xc2\xa0 Will you commit to eventually releasing those to the public?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to commit that those letters exist.\xc2\xa0 But let me see if we can do a little work and get you some more details on this.</p>\n<p>Angela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The Summit on Violent Extremism is going on right next door.\xc2\xa0 And the President and the Vice President yesterday have gone to great lengths to not say that it\xe2\x80\x99s a summit about Islamic extremism.\xc2\xa0 They say it\xe2\x80\x99s broader than that.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the groups that are participating, most of them -- most of the community groups are related in one way or another to the Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 How do you square the message with the participants?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Angela, I think what I would say is that we\'re very mindful of the fact that a particularly virulent strain of extremist ideology has tried to insert itself in the Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question about that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s true in the United States; that\'s true in other places around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that will be the subject of extensive discussion at the summit.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we also recognize that there are other forms of extremism that have prompted others to carry acts of violence even on American soil.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked on a couple of previous occasions about the violent extremist who carried out an attack on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin; or the radical ideology that prompted someone to go and open fire outside a Jewish community center in Kansas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are -- extremism has taken a variety of forms in this country in a way that has had violent results.\xc2\xa0 And we want to be focused on making sure that we\'re countering all of that.\xc2\xa0 But that does not diminish in any way the concern that we have that some extremists have made some inroads into some Muslim communities in attempting to inspire them to carry out acts of violence or to join their fight.\xc2\xa0 And we have worked very hard and very diligently with the Muslim community here in this country, with local law enforcement, and with political leaders to counter that ideology and to counter that messaging.\xc2\xa0 And that is something about which we remain vigilant.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And today\xe2\x80\x99s summit, or this week\xe2\x80\x99s summit provides a good venue for talking about some of the successes of that strategy and to identify some of the additional steps that we can take to further safeguard the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any groups you can point to that are there participating in the summit that are targeted at other groups?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to the National Security Council.\xc2\xa0 They will be able to provide you some more information about other individuals who are participating in the summit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the United States support the Egyptian request that the international coalition airstrikes should include Libya too?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is that right now what we have said is that we are supportive of the ongoing efforts of the U.N. Special Representative and his efforts to try to facilitate the formation of a national unity government, that we believe that that is sort of the next appropriate step here.\xc2\xa0 But we are certainly mindful of the fact that there are extremists that are trying to establish or at least capitalize on the instability in Libya to carry out acts of violence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we saw over the weekend this brutal killing of 21, I believe, Egyptian Christians in that country.\xc2\xa0 And that obviously is something that we strongly condemn, something the President condemned over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are going to coordinate with the international community to try to bring about some stability in Libya and make that a much less hospitable place for extremist groups to carry out acts of violence like this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, does the President think that some Syrian rebels should be able to call airstrikes and they could be as effective as the Peshmerga was in Iraq calling airstrikes on ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said in general is that the United States and our coalition partners are prepared to back up the efforts of local fighters on the ground with airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 And many have noted that the track record of some local fighters in Syria against ISIL is not particularly good, that in battle after battle ISIL has succeeded in defeating those rebels.\xc2\xa0 But we would anticipate that, with better training and better equipment, that those rebels would perform better.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why there is this American-led effort, in close coordination with our partners in the region, to train and equip moderate Syrian opposition fighters.</p>\n<p>We\'ve also indicated that we would expect that with better training and equipment and the backing of sophisticated military airstrikes, that their performance on the battlefield would improve.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly would envision a time in which military airpower would be used to back up the efforts to fighters on the ground.</p>\n<p>You may be asking a more specific or even --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The ability to call in those airstrikes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For the way in which those local ground forces would interact with coalition military aircraft, I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense on that and on exactly how that communication would take place.\xc2\xa0 But part of our strategy here is predicated on the idea that military airpower could be used to enhance the performance of Syrian opposition fighters on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 And it his op-ed about the summit, the President -- you mentioned this a couple times -- the President wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cEfforts to counter violent extremism will only succeed if citizens can address legitimate grievances through the democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 When it comes to groups like ISIS, what legitimate grievances do you think they have that should be taken through the democratic process??</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think when we\'re talking about ISIL leaders, there is nothing that they could possibly use to justify the brutality that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them carry out; that this is an ideology that is totally bankrupt and is impossible to justify.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why I think you haven\xe2\x80\x99t just seen a strong reaction from the United States to counter their efforts, you\'ve actually seen a strong reaction from more than 60 countries around the world that have joined with the United States to take the fight to degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given that, what would the legitimate grievances of either ISIS or any other extremist group be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\'t have the op-ed in front of me.\xc2\xa0 But I believe that that\'s actually a reference to the efforts of the administration and obviously local law enforcement and other community leaders here in this country to prevent ISIL from succeeding in recruiting and inspiring people to join their fight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And one part of that strategy is trying to remove grievances that those individuals may have.\xc2\xa0 And that is part of why so much of the outreach that we\'re doing to communities across this country isn\xe2\x80\x99t just through law enforcement, but through community leaders that also have an interest in trying to protect their youth and making sure that they are aware of the kinds of support and opportunities that exist in their communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the full quote was, \xe2\x80\x9cGovernments that deny human rights play into the hands of extremists who claim that violence is the only way to achieve change.\xc2\xa0 Efforts to counter violent extremism will only succeed if citizens can address legitimate grievances through the democratic process.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just struggling to understand.\xc2\xa0 So to be clear, ISIS doesn\'t have any legitimate grievances.\xc2\xa0 Are there any extremists that have legitimate grievances?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Ed, the point of that element of the op-ed is to make clear that there is not just a need but also a benefit to ensuring that countries that are carrying out counterterrorism operations within their borders do so with proper respect for universal human rights.</p>\n<p>One example of a country that I didn\'t cite earlier in terms of places where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working to try to counter terrorism and extremism is in Nigeria.\xc2\xa0 And there have been elements of assistance that the U.S. government has offered to the Nigerian government to aid their efforts.\xc2\xa0 But each time we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been mindful of the need to remind the Nigerian government that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to respect those basic universal human rights, even as they carry out those counterterrorism operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Boko Harm does not have legitimate grievances.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, they don\'t.\xc2\xa0 But what we want to do is we want to make sure that Boko Haram doesn\'t have a fertile recruiting ground in Nigeria that only is enhanced if you have a Nigerian government that runs roughshod over the basic human rights and values of their citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple other quick things.\xc2\xa0 In answer to Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question about the 21 Christians being killed this weekend, you said the President put out a strong statement this weekend.\xc2\xa0 The statement on Sunday was from you.\xc2\xa0 It said \xe2\x80\x9cStatement by the Press Secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, it was not a statement from the President.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I misspoke on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 And then in that statement -- that\'s why I want to ask you -- because you put it out, under your name -- you talked about the murder of 21 \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious why didn\'t you mention it was 21 Christians killed by Muslims?\xc2\xa0 Is that relevant?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It sure is, because the ISIL extremists who carried out this attack indicated that the reason that they were killing them wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just because they were Egyptian, but also because they were Christian.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has been very clear that it is -- the President talked about this actually in his prayer breakfast speech that he gave earlier this month, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility of people of all faiths to stand up and speak out when individuals try to use faith and distort faith to try to justify an act of violence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given that, why were you not clear on Sunday?\xc2\xa0 It went out under your name.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t you say 21 Christians were killed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be clear here.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t account for that specific line in the statement.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear there that we condemn this murder.\xc2\xa0 The President was clear in the op-ed that was published today, and on a variety of occasions I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear here, that we condemn the outrageous killing of these Egyptian citizens because of their Christian faith.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And last one.\xc2\xa0 Two days earlier, on the 13th, you put out a statement under the President\xe2\x80\x99s name about the tragic deaths of the three Muslim students at the University of North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 And in there, the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why was their Muslim faith relevant in that statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated, the situation in North Carolina is still under investigation.\xc2\xa0 And local law enforcement authorities there are trying to determine exactly what the motivation of the individual who has been charged with this crime was.\xc2\xa0 And so that is still under investigation.</p>\n<p>But what is clear is that there is this principle that exists, regardless of the faith of the individual in question, that people should not be targeted because of their religion, and what they look like, or what their last name is, or how they worship.\xc2\xa0 That is true --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence that in that North Carolina case they were targeted because they were Muslim?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that\'s still under --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People are saying it was because of a parking space. We don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a local law enforcement investigation right now, as you said.\xc2\xa0 So why was their faith invoked in the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I think it is important for the President in this case, as he has in many others, to articulate a pretty clear principle.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of principle that the vast majority of Americans should be able to support, which is that people should not -- regardless of their faith -- be targeted because of what their last name is, what they look like, or how they worship.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we don\'t know that they were targeted because of their last name or their faith.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So I guess, Ed, what you could -- and I think that\'s acknowledged in the statement, as well.\xc2\xa0 And we have also acknowledged that this is an issue that\'s under investigation in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 But I think as a principle, this is the kind of thing we should all be able to agree with.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the summit.\xc2\xa0 What exactly is the take-away that you anticipate from this?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no executive action.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no governmental action.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a talking shop.\xc2\xa0 What is the point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Bill.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I meant that as a compliment.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I hope that\'s the way you took it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I will after I think about it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the real take-away here is this is an opportunity for us to make sure that people all across the country understand what kinds of effective strategies are being put in place in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and Boston to try to safeguard communities all across the country.</p>\n<p>And so there are effective strategies that they\xe2\x80\x99ve used in those communities to counter the radical messaging and ideology that extremists can propagate on social media.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that communities all across the country are aware of the tools that are available to them.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a worthwhile exercise, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that local leaders from across the country will benefit from.</p>\n<p>But again, I guess what I would encourage you to do is, before you pass judgment on the summit, is let\xe2\x80\x99s wait until the summit concludes.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to follow up with those who participated to see whether or not they found it to be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The extremists you mentioned are mostly Muslim, of course, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t say that -- even though that is the subject of much of the discourse here today.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I did in answer to Angela\xe2\x80\x99s question, that we are particularly concerned about the success that some extremists have had in inhabiting some dark corners of the Muslim world to try to distort the tenets of that religion in a way that justifies their radical ideology and their violent acts.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that we strongly condemn.\xc2\xa0 And we devote significant resources here in this country and in local communities across the country to countering that messaging.\xc2\xa0 And that will certainly be an intense focus of conversation in the context of this summit, but not the only focus.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just won\xe2\x80\x99t call it militant Islam or anything like that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what we call it and why we approach this challenge in this way.</p>\n<p>Byron.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 New York Times reporter James Risen said yesterday that the Obama administration is the greatest enemy to press freedom in a generation, and that he plans to spend the rest of his life fighting to undo the damage to press freedom done by Barack Obama and Eric Holder.\xc2\xa0 Those are awfully strong words from a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.\xc2\xa0 Can I get you to react?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, I think that over the last couple of years, you\'ve seen the Attorney General in particular take some very important steps to try to make sure this administration was striking the right balance between law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s need to protect national security and to respect the freedom of the press, a freedom that the President believes is critically important to the success of our country.\xc2\xa0 So the Attorney General has made clear that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that journalists should be prosecuted or put in jail just because they\xe2\x80\x99re doing their job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Attorney General, in reaction to this situation, has convened meetings with well-known and influential journalists from across the country to discuss some of these issues about striking that appropriate balance.\xc2\xa0 And the feedback that he has gotten out of those meetings has been very positive; that even the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press said the Justice Department had \xe2\x80\x9cturned a corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And the Washington Post Editorial Board said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a welcome evolution by Attorney General Eric Holder on these issues.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is certainly the kind of work that the administration believes is important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also the kind of work that\xe2\x80\x99s always ongoing; that as we consider striking a balance between two important competing -- in some cases, competing priorities, that we\xe2\x80\x99re always going to have to evaluate what steps are being taken to strike the right balance.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are pleased with the kind of progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know this occurred while the briefing was underway, but Jeb Bush had some awfully harsh words about the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 He said the administration talks, but words fade, that you draw red lines but then erase them, and that you\xe2\x80\x99ve shown a reckless disregard for the long-term interests of the country.\xc2\xa0 Could I just get you to react?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Probably not today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, any details on the Chicago trip tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Will the President be making an appearance with Mayor Emanuel or any more information?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details on the Chicago trip out before the end of the day today, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you on that.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How could he not go to Chicago and meet with Rahm?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can I go back to some of the questions about the summit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you hoping that by the end of the summit that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find ways to enhance surveillance in Muslim communities?\xc2\xa0 Is that one of the goals of this summit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the fact that as we address some of these challenges in communities all across the country, that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be solely a law enforcement response; that obviously local law enforcement has a particularly important role to play.\xc2\xa0 And those local law enforcement agencies that have worked hard to build strong relationships in the communities that they serve and protect can be particularly effective in helping us counter this messaging.</p>\n<p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only tool in the toolbox.\xc2\xa0 We also need to enlist the support and participation of community leaders, of teachers, and of others, even religious leaders, who also have an interest in trying to protect their community and trying to insulate particularly vulnerable young people from this kind of radical extremist ideology.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s a particularly difficult thing to do now, and even in some ways you could argue that it\'s more difficult now than it has been in the past.\xc2\xa0 You have extremists that are operating even in remote locations of the world, but because they have access to the Internet they can widely propagate their extremist ideology in ways that can be heard by people all around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That means that we have to be even more vigilant and creative as we try to counter this messaging, and there are a variety of ways that we can do that.\xc2\xa0 Some of it involves law enforcement, but also it means that it\'s important for us to mobilize other influential, well-respected members of the community.\xc2\xa0 In some ways, the best way to counter this radical ideology is for people who are members and leaders in that community to stand up and say that it\'s wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For all the flack that you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken over not using the term Islamic extremism, or Islamic terrorism, there are members of the Muslim faith who believe that you\xe2\x80\x99re picking on them.\xc2\xa0 And how do you respond to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think that this -- I think there are a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, it\'s important for the leaders of any community to not feel as if anybody is picking on them.\xc2\xa0 This sort of goes back to the value statement that Ed referred to earlier.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important that people understand that we are going to be committed to and protective of the notion that people should not be targeted because of what they look like or how they worship.\xc2\xa0 And that is just a basic value that is central to the founding of this country.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s that part of it.</p>\n<p>The second part of it is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you are, in a sense, isolating a particular faith in one respect in that -- I mean, as Bill Plante and others have asked the question, Angela asked the question -- I mean, by and large, this summit is focusing on these communities.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\'s in black and white, it\'s in the list of participants that you\xe2\x80\x99ve submitted to the press.\xc2\xa0 There are Islamic-American groups who are going to be protesting outside the White House today because they are concerned that this is the focus of the summit.\xc2\xa0 So why not just say it?\xc2\xa0 Just that it is what it is?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Why not just say what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That concerns about extremism in Muslim-American communities or Muslim communities around the world is the focus of this summit.\xc2\xa0 It just seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re tiptoeing through the tulips here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\'m tiptoeing anywhere.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fight here.\xc2\xa0 This is the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, and there is no question that radical ideologues around the globe have sought, and in some cases succeeded, in infiltrating some elements of the Muslim world to propagate their ideology and to try to distort that religion to justify their terrible acts of violence.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Jim, they would love nothing more than for the United States to engage in a -- the United States or the West to engage in a religious war with them.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, that is not what this is.\xc2\xa0 This is not a religious war.\xc2\xa0 This is not a war on Islam.\xc2\xa0 And those individuals do not represent Islam; the leaders of Islam say as much.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of ways that we can assess this.\xc2\xa0 Let me just give you one good example.</p>\n<p>In the operation to recover and bring to justice Osama bin Laden, our operators also recovered a treasure trove of material from his residence where they were able to evaluate some of his ongoing communications and even some of his thinking about the state of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And in those writings there is clear evidence that he was frustrated; that Osama bin Laden was frustrated that al Qaeda was being recognized and acknowledged and fought, not as a religious organization, but as a terrorist group.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He even contemplated, in those writings, changing the name of al Qaeda to try to more closely identify it with Islam.\xc2\xa0 He felt like that would be helpful to their flagging recruiting efforts.\xc2\xa0 That is an indication that our efforts to be crystal-clear about what it is that we\'re fighting and what we\'re not has not just been successful, but actually frustrated the efforts of our enemies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I guess I\'ll just end it by saying this.\xc2\xa0 You noted that there has been some flack that we\'ve taken.\xc2\xa0 It\'s worth it if that\'s what we need to do to make sure that we\'re going to continue to succeed in countering this radical ideology and making sure that we can succeed in mobilizing the international community to take the fight to them, and in the case of ISIL, to degrade and destroy them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t mind that flack?\xc2\xa0 You welcome it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on ISIS, I\'m just curious, in following up on Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question about what happened in Egypt -- or excuse me, what happened in Libya -- what is the best sense of this White House as to how far and how wide ISIS has spread?\xc2\xa0 And how many countries in ISIS now operating, in the view and assessment of this administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, what we are focused on right now is the threat that ISIL poses in both Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is the place where they are trying to establish, based on their own aspirations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated publicly, where they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to establish their own Islamic state.\xc2\xa0 And because of the efforts of the United States and the other members of our coalition, we have succeeded in blunting their progress and, in many cases, even rolling it back.</p>\n<p>There are others around the world who have occasionally popped up and indicated that they have claimed an association with ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We\'re certainly mindful of the desire of ISIL to try to spread and propagate their ideology.\xc2\xa0 But where we\'re focused right now and where we believe ISIL is most dangerous is in this area of Iraq and in Syria, and that\'s why we\'re focusing our efforts there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that he believes that ISIS is on the defensive.\xc2\xa0 He said that last week.\xc2\xa0 But it seems that they are spreading to more and more countries, and we\'re seeing evidence of that almost every week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would caution you about that, Jim, because I think it\'s important for us to differentiate between the spread of ISIL and individuals who are trying to attract attention for themselves by claiming an association with ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Those are two very different things.\xc2\xa0 And I think the best example we have of this is the situation that we saw in Afghanistan a couple of weeks ago, where an individual who claimed to be affiliated with ISIL -- as I mentioned, I think, at the time -- that had less to do with ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s success in propagating their ideology and spoke more to the kinds of internal divisions that we\'re starting to see in the Taliban right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, we\'re obviously going to be very cognizant of and closely monitor any of this radical ideology and any of the efforts that ISIL makes to try to spread it around the globe, even to other countries.\xc2\xa0 But our focus right now is where they\xe2\x80\x99re most dangerous, and that\'s in Iraq and in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the briefing end without asking you about Russia.\xc2\xa0 The NATO Secretary General said that the cease-fire has not been respected in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 If the cease-fire is dead, what\xe2\x80\x99s the next move?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, what I know is that I know that the leaders of these four countries -- France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia -- are supposed to have a conversation again today, I believe via telephone, to talk about the status of the Minsk implementation plan.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, we believe that it\'s important for all sides to live up to that agreement.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also crystal-clear that the Russian-backed separatists and Russia themselves have not lived up to their commitments that they made in the context of those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Their failure to do so does put them at risk of greater costs.\xc2\xa0 And they should be mindful of that as they consider their next steps.</p>\n<p>But we continue to believe that the way that this situation can be resolved is around the negotiating table, and that\'s why we\'re going to continue to support ongoing negotiations.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re right if you point out that those negotiations are only going to be successful if the people who participate in those negotiations are willing to live up to the commitments that they have made.\xc2\xa0 And it is clear that thus far -- at least in the last few days -- the Russians and the separatists that they back have not done that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And arms to the Ukrainians -- that\'s still on the table as an option?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any update beyond how the President discussed this last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Tommy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on what you were saying about the flack you\xe2\x80\x99re getting.\xc2\xa0 The phrase that everybody wants to use is \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islam,\xe2\x80\x9d and the narrative is that if you don\'t use the secret password, \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islam,\xe2\x80\x9d that you can\'t possibly defeat ISIS.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve heard this sort of spreading out beyond conservative circles, and I\'m wondering -- because I\'ve heard you describe in so many words what is radical Islam, which is like the hateful ideology and all that -- has there been any thought given to just disarming this whole thing by just throwing the phrase into maybe the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks or something, even if it\'s in a sentence in which you make clear the distinction you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to make?\xc2\xa0 Do you know what I mean?\xc2\xa0 Sort of stop giving them something to hit against -- just say it, yeah, radical Islam, and it\'s not all of Islam.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Tommy, I guess this does sort of go to what I was saying to Jim, which is that -- at least I\'ll speak for myself -- I\'m not particularly concerned about the flack.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure that we\'re pursuing the most effective strategy.\xc2\xa0 And again, anybody who wants to evaluate that strategy can do so by taking a look at the way that Osama bin Laden himself described the state of al Qaeda and his frustration that our ability to prevent him from succeeding in declaring a religious war between Islam and the West was frustrating his efforts to advance his radical agenda; it was frustrating the efforts to that organization to recruit new members; and it even prompted him to even contemplate changing the name of his organization to try to get people to identify them as a religious organization as opposed to what they are, which is a terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear indication that our strategy is making progress and, like I\xe2\x80\x99ve told Jim, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth the flack.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question.\xc2\xa0 The conservative media is sort of flipping out over comments that Marie Harf made this morning.\xc2\xa0 She was talking, again, about radical Islam and trying to explain that this summit is about other forms of extremism, and she brought up Joseph Kony\xe2\x80\x99s Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Resistance Army as an example of -- the phrase she used was Christian militant -- or a \xe2\x80\x9cmilitant Christian organization.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can explain the difference between calling Kony\xe2\x80\x99s LRA a militant Christian organization and using a term like radical Islam.\xc2\xa0 How are you not -- in other words, how are you not avoiding the thing with Christians that you are avoiding with Islam?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did not see my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s comments on this topic earlier today, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sort of weigh in and try to explain what she meant if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually see them.\xc2\xa0 So why don\xe2\x80\x99t you check with the folks at the State Department?\xc2\xa0 They may be able to explain what she was discussing there.</p>\n<p>George, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question for a second.\xc2\xa0 You do seem to be tiptoeing around who the victims are.\xc2\xa0 And last week, when Jon was questioning you, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say they were Jewish victims in Paris, and then your statement didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Christian victims.\xc2\xa0 Assuming this isn\xe2\x80\x99t coincidence, is it the administration\xe2\x80\x99s belief that it\xe2\x80\x99s counterproductive to stress the religion of the victims?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s just do it this way.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll put an end to the tiptoeing -- to the extent that there\xe2\x80\x99s been any -- and if people assume that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been tiptoeing, let me just try to be as clear as I can and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how this works.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I tried to make clear to Jon last week, and as I made clear in a tweet following, there is no doubt about the motivation of the individual who carried out this attack against a Kosher market in Paris.\xc2\xa0 He was motivated by anti-Semitism, and he went to that market hoping that he could kill Jewish people, and he was targeting them because they were Jewish.</p>\n<p>The public statements of the ISIS militants, or the people who claim to be affiliated with ISIS in Libya, indicated that they were killing these Egyptians because of their Christian faith.\xc2\xa0 And we have been crystal-clear in the statement that we put out from the President on Friday and the President\xe2\x80\x99s prayer breakfast remarks earlier this month that it is wrong and completely unacceptable and unjustifiable to target people, particularly with acts of violence, because of who they are, because of who they worship, because of what their last name is, or because of what they look like.</p>\n<p>And this is a value that we have carefully subscribed to and ardently defended, not just in this country but around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you have seen the United States take military action in Iraq, for example, to try to protect the Yazidi people who were threatened by genocide, by the Islamic militants -- or the ISIL militants in Iraq when they were making progress in that country earlier this summer.\xc2\xa0 The United States took action to defend them.\xc2\xa0 And there is a long history in this country, and a proud history in this country, of the United States taking action to protect people who are being targeted because of what they look like or because of who they worship.\xc2\xa0 That is a proud tradition of this country.</p>\n<p>To sort of blend this with the debate that we had at the end of last year, it strengthens our moral authority around the globe and it strengthens our national security when people look upon the United States as a country that\xe2\x80\x99s willing to stand up and protect the people who are being targeted because of what they look like or who they worship.\xc2\xa0 And that is something -- that is a value that we believe certainly applies in this country, but we believe it\'s a value that applies around the world.\xc2\xa0 And it is why when the President goes and visits with foreign leaders around the globe, he makes clear how important he believes it is for those leaders to uphold the universal human values, and uphold those universal human rights, and to protect their citizens to ensure that they can exercise those universal human rights.</p>\n<p>And this is a subject of -- this is work that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be ongoing, but its work that the United States has long been committed to, and that commitment is not flagged under the leadership of President Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good day.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:11 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
