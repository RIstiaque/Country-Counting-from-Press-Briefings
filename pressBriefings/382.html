EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to beautiful Portland, Maine.\xc2\xa0 The President will participate in a couple of campaign events, as you know.\xc2\xa0 One thing that you should be on the lookout for in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today in Portland is the reference that he will make to the latest indications of our strengthening economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you probably noticed, the latest GDP numbers came out.\xc2\xa0 They indicated that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the last six months, the U.S. economy has grown by just over 4 percent, which is actually the fastest rate of economic growth as measured by GDP in the American economy in more than 10 years.</p>\n<p>This comes on top of recent labor indicators that show that the U.S. economy is very resilient and continues to be the envy of the world.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the policies that were put in place by this administration that have been strongly supported by Democrats all across the country, and which supported the by grit and determination of America\xe2\x80\x99s workforce and the innovation and entrepreneurialism of America\xe2\x80\x99s business owners large and small, the American economy continues to gain momentum.</p>\n<p>And the President is eager for partners in Congress and in state houses all across the country who are willing to work to advance policies that we know will benefit middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 The President believes this is good for middle-class families, obviously, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also good for our broader economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the best way for us to capitalize on the momentum that we\xe2\x80\x99re now seeing -- because the President believes that our economy grows best when it\xe2\x80\x99s growing from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 And there are a whole range of policies that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President discuss later today that he believes would allow us to capitalize on this momentum.</p>\n<p>And so he\xe2\x80\x99ll say it better than I just did, but I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to listen carefully to that aspect of the remarks the President will deliver today and the remarks that he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver in Rhode Island tomorrow.</p>\n<p>So with that, let me get to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the nurse in Maine who went out on a bike ride, or what have you, would the President like her to go into quarantine, or is he planning to meet her today?\xc2\xa0 I suspect not.\xc2\xa0 And when he made his remarks last night -- \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t hermetically seal ourselves\xe2\x80\x9d -- was he referring to Governor Christie and Governor Cuomo?\xc2\xa0 Or who was he referring to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President does not have any plans to see Ms. Hickox while he is in her home state today.</p>\n<p>When the CDC released guidelines for how state and local officials can monitor the health of individuals who have recently returned from West Africa, it signaled a continuation of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to allowing science to guide our policies.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, the regimen that we have put in place is to organize, or I guess to -- organize is not the right word.\xc2\xa0 What the policies indicate is that as individuals return from West Africa, we should assess on a personal basis what sort of risk they pose to the broader international -- or broader American community based on what sort of interaction they had with people who are at risk of Ebola in West Africa.</p>\n<p>So people who have had -- health care workers, for example, who have had direct contact with Ebola patients are assessed to be at a different level or risk than individuals who merely happen to be traveling in the region.\xc2\xa0 And so what the CDC has indicated is that these risk assessments should be performed to determine what sort of risk individuals pose to others in the community.\xc2\xa0 And then that also should guide the degree to which the health of that individual is monitored upon their return for three weeks.</p>\n<p>That guidance has been shared by the CDC to state and local officials who ultimately are responsible for putting in place policies that they believe are in the best interest of protecting their citizens.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we believe that those decisions should be driven by science, but ultimately it\'s state and local officials that have the authority for implementing these policies.</p>\n<p>So what I can tell you about the situation as it relates to Ms. Hickox is that officials at the CDC who are experts in this field have been in regular touch with public health officials in Maine who are responsible for setting the policies in the state of Maine.\xc2\xa0 That is at it should be.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that the scientific expertise that has been amassed at the CDC should be freely shared with state and local officials in Maine. He also believes that those officials in Maine should be guided by the science as they implement the policy that they believe is in the best interest of the people of their state.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then -- sorry, did you have more?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then does he support the nurse defying Maine\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that she self-isolate for 21 days?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, the President -- what I would say is that the President believes that the state can and should be responsible for setting this policy.\xc2\xa0 The President believes those policies should be guided by science, but ultimately it is their decision.\xc2\xa0 And because of his belief that these policies should be guided by science, he\xe2\x80\x99s directed the CDC to be in close touch with public health officials in all the states across the country, but in this case in the state of Maine.\xc2\xa0 But the President also recognizes that it\'s state officials\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to implement these policies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean Maine\xe2\x80\x99s policies aren\xe2\x80\x99t guided by science?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to render a judgment on that.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, public health officials in Maine will have to decide what they believe is in the best interest of the people of their state.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll do that in consultation with the experts at the CDC.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately that\'s something for them to decide, not for me to decide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you said the President has no plans to see Ms. Hickox while he\xe2\x80\x99s in the same state.\xc2\xa0 Has he or Ron Klain or anybody else in the administration talked with her?\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans to do by phone?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any conversations from anybody at the White House with Ms. Hickox, and I don\'t know of any plans at this point to place any calls.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have there been any conversations between the White House and the Governor of Maine?\xc2\xa0 And does the President intend to speak to the Governor of Maine about this personally?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of; certainly not between the President and the Governor.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there have been any conversations between officials at the White House and state officials in Maine.\xc2\xa0 But I know that the principal communication has been between public health officials in Maine and public health experts at the Centers for Disease Control.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that will be something he would discuss with Congressman Michaud when they see each other later?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President is planning to bring it up, but I don\'t know exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a campaign question?\xc2\xa0 Over the next few days, is the President disappointed that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be able to campaign in more competitive Senate races?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does he share the view that that would be counterproductive?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The view that is shared I think by everybody at the White House is that we want to do everything that we can to support candidates up and down the ballot who are interested in advancing economic policies that are in the best interest of middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of ways in which the President himself and his broader campaign team, including those outside the White House, can assist other candidates as they -- in the run-up to Election Day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he disappointed not to be in the thick of it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the people of Maine think that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty competitive governor\xe2\x80\x99s race here, and the President is pleased about the opportunity that he\'ll have to weigh in in support of somebody like Congressman Michaud, who has a strong track record of fighting for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 He himself is somebody who has his own track record.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not a career politician.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who has his own track record of making ends meet and working in a blue-collar job in Maine.\xc2\xa0 And those are the kinds of values that he took with him to Washington and I\'m confident those are the kinds of values that he\'ll take with him to the statehouse as the next governor of the great state of Maine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, turning to ISIS, if we can -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw the Times story today.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with his Chief of Staff that the White House should have -- or that the U.S. should have engaged ISIS sooner?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s interesting that you ask that question.\xc2\xa0 Prior to our departure I was speaking to the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor, Tony Blinken, and he spent a lot of time yesterday -- I guess he appeared at this Washington Ideas Forum where he discussed in great detail the focus that the administration had on the strengthening elements of al Qaeda in Iraq; that we know it\'s those elements of al Qaeda in Iraq that eventually turned into ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there was a significant high-level conversation between U.S. officials and Iraqi officials, as far back as a year ago, encouraging the Iraqi government to take the necessary steps to unite that country and take very seriously the threat that was posed by these al Qaeda-affiliated extremists that were operating in this region of the world.\xc2\xa0 This was even something that was discussed by the President with Prime Minister Maliki when he was at the White House last fall.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a threat that the administration and the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team has been closely following.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve articulated on many occasions our disappointment that the Iraqi government did not more effectively lead that country and unite that country to face down this threat from extremists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in the last several months, you\'ve seen the United States and other allies of ours, or at least other partners of ours in the region go to great lengths to support the Iraqi people and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders as they put in place a government that was truly representative of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population so that that government and its political leaders could succeed in uniting that country to face the threat from ISIL that has emerged on a much greater and more public scale in the last few months.</p>\n<p>So our efforts to do that continue to this day.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Blinken himself just traveled to Iraq earlier this month to continue these conversations and to talk about what more the United States and the broader international community could do to support the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government as they face down the threat from ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seemed that Denis was saying that if the comprehensive strategy that you just described had started not in June -- or May or June -- had started months earlier once ISIS started its offensive, as opposed to sort of as it started threatening Baghdad, that the situation on the ground now would be markedly different.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- our strategy all along, Zeke, has been predicated on the idea that it was critically important for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to unite that country so that they can take the fight to ISIL in their own country; that our strategy has never revolved around a significant commitment of American ground troops in Iraq in a combat role to take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That strategy is not something that we support now and it certainly is not a strategy that the President would have endorsed a year ago.</p>\n<p>What we have said, again, for quite some time is that the first step in this process was building political support in Iraq so that that country could take responsibility for its own security situation.\xc2\xa0 And the President was very clear that if they took those steps to unite the country, that the United States and the rest of the international community, or at least a large chunk of the international community, would be there to support them in that endeavor in a variety of ways -- diplomatically, economically and, yes, militarily -- to counter the threat from ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did you make of that story in general?\xc2\xa0 It seemed to make a case that Kerry and Hagel might leave after the election.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any insight into those decisions.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you -- and I think this was evident from the story, too -- that the President and his senior team at the White House is proud of the work that the senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet are performing to represent our interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 This is a very tumultuous time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think Secretary Kerry in particular is somebody who has worked very hard to advance U.S. interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 I saw that there was a reference in the story to the Sandra Bullock movie, \xe2\x80\x9cGravity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that I\xe2\x80\x99d heard Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s name associated with that film.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that it seems to me that the one thing that Secretary Kerry has with Sandra Bullock\xe2\x80\x99s character is that he himself has circled the globe many times to advance U.S. interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And from working very hard to ensure the first peaceful, democratic transition of power in the history of Afghanistan, to ridding Syria of their declared chemical weapons stockpile, to effectuating and supporting Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders as they took the very important political steps that I referred to earlier to unite that country, that Secretary Kerry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just been busy, he\xe2\x80\x99s been effective in representing and advancing American interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to his skill.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a testament to the confidence that the President has in his abilities as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s chief diplomat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning, Kerry said he thought that the peace process with Israel was still doable.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you sounded a bit more gloomy in the briefing.\xc2\xa0 To what extent do you think the White House relationship with Israel is now part of the problem rather than a symptom of the problem?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the entirety of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has -- that would sort of be the other example that I would cite, is somebody who has worked very effectively to push both Israeli leaders and Palestinian leaders to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 They have not yet reached an agreement, and they haven\'t been engaged in negotiations recently.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is simple; it\xe2\x80\x99s simply that there are very difficult decisions that will be required by leaders of both sides to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States, for all of our efforts and support for the process, cannot ultimately be responsible for making those decisions.\xc2\xa0 Those decisions are only going to stick if you have the leaders from both sides willing to make them.\xc2\xa0 And those decisions in the short term may not be politically popular, but those decisions over the long term are clearly in the best interest of the people that they represent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry is somebody who has significant credibility with leaders on both sides, and he\xe2\x80\x99s used that credibility to bring them along and at least encourage them to confront those decisions.\xc2\xa0 And that has been helpful to this broader process.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who continues to be very optimistic about the opportunity that exists there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work on.</p>\n<p>Let me just say one other thing about that, which is -- you raised the issue of what impact the U.S. relationship with Israel might have on that broader process -- it continues to be the view of the President and other members of the White House team that the bonds between the United States and Israel are unshakeable, and the kind of security cooperation that you see between the United States and Israel at this point in our relationship is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, convened a meeting at the White House just today with her counterpart and senior Israeli defense, counterterrorism and intelligence officials.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of the kind of ongoing cooperation that exists that\xe2\x80\x99s so critical to American interests in the region and to Israeli national security.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Lisa.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was going to say this is the second time in a week that unnamed White House sources have given embarrassing quotes with regard to Secretary Kerry, with regard to Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House feel about these leaks? And is it productive in a time when you\xe2\x80\x99re facing so many crises, like Ebola and ISIS and even Ukraine and Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, all of you work very hard on pretty much a daily if not hourly basis to cultivate your sources and encourage them to say colorful things that might get attention.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything wrong with that.\xc2\xa0 All I can try to do is to try to help you understand what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view is of all these issues.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes the view that I\xe2\x80\x99ll articulate will be consistent with the view that you hear from some of your anonymous sources, and sometimes there might be a little daylight between the view that\xe2\x80\x99s expressed by your sources anonymously and the official, accurate position of the administration.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just part of the process.</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that those of us who are working on these issues every day at the White House aren\xe2\x80\x99t distracted by the sometimes colorful, sometimes problematic, and in the case of Sandra Bullock, sometimes amusing, comments that are published in the newspaper.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact is, the President, Secretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel, Mr. McDonough and others have very important responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 They take those responsibilities seriously, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not distracted by anonymous quotes or other things that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a genuine impact on our policies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s another story today that John Podesta was in a meeting with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as well as the President\xe2\x80\x99s former campaign manager, David Plouffe, plotting out potentially former Secretary of State Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s future presidential run.\xc2\xa0 Is it appropriate for a President\xe2\x80\x99s senior advisor, somebody on the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 payroll to be moonlighting as a presidential strategist for another candidate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw the story.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific meeting.\xc2\xa0 However, if it did occur, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that Mr. Podesta participated in that meeting on his personal time and in his capacity as a private citizen of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 So, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that it raises any questions or concerns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does it indicate that the President is taking sides, with the Vice President talking -- he\xe2\x80\x99s saying he wants to make up his mind next year.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it does not.\xc2\xa0 What it indicates is that Mr. Podesta has two things.\xc2\xa0 One is a reputation of -- as one of the sharpest political minds in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also an indication that Mr. Podesta has a very long and close, personal relationship with the President and Mrs. Clinton.</p>\n<p>Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not the meeting occurred, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to implicitly confirm its existence.\xc2\xa0 But whether the meeting occurred or not, those two things about Mr. Podesta are true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to foreign policy --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think Darlene had the next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An update on immigration.\xc2\xa0 A decision was supposed to be coming after the election.\xc2\xa0 The election is next Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what is the thinking on when something would be announced.\xc2\xa0 Would it have to wait until after the President returns from Asia?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on timing.\xc2\xa0 But if I can get you some more detailed guidance about the timing next week I will try to do that, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t promise to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 NATO today said that they intercepted two Russian military planes in the Baltics.\xc2\xa0 The President, when he spoke in Estonia a few weeks back, was very clear that the U.S. and NATO wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand for Russia incursion into the Baltics.\xc2\xa0 And this appears to be that.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reaction to that development today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to my colleagues at the NSC.\xc2\xa0 I will just say as a factual matter that the President I think was unambiguous when he delivered that speech in Estonia earlier this fall in reiterating the United States\xe2\x80\x99 firm commitment to the alliance that the United States has with Estonia and the other Baltic republics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update on the hacking situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update.\xc2\xa0 I assume you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the activity of concern on the White House network that we discussed?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- cyber activity?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts are ongoing as related to our effort to evaluate that activity and to mitigate against the risk that it may pose.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you find out -- assuming you find out who is responsible, will you release that information?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think as we learn more information about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to share that information.\xc2\xa0 I suspect some of the anonymous sources that we were referring to earlier in this gaggle may have something to say to you all about that in the days ahead.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s something you guys are all hard at work on.\xc2\xa0 At this point, I can tell you that our team that\xe2\x80\x99s been focused on this continues to be engaged in an effort to evaluate this activity and mitigate the risk that it poses to the network.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us about Ron Klain\xe2\x80\x99s visit to CDC today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have a couple of things on that.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, Mr. Klain did travel to the CDC.\xc2\xa0 He was there to meet with Dr. Frieden and other senior officials at the CDC.\xc2\xa0 Ron has met with Dr. Frieden once in person, but the two men have spoken every day since Ron started in the job a little over a week ago.</p>\n<p>While he\xe2\x80\x99s there, I would anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll raise -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on three different issues.\xc2\xa0 The first is some incident management issues.\xc2\xa0 The second is hospital preparedness all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And third are the ongoing and tenacious efforts by CDC officials in West Africa to stop this outbreak at the source.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Incident management?\xc2\xa0 Do you mean how things have been managed, or how things should be managed and will be managed going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think mostly the latter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems Tim Cook of Apple was discussing his sexuality, and the President is going to be campaigning with a man who would be the first gay governor -- openly gay governor this evening.\xc2\xa0 I just wondered if you had any comment on why men in such senior levels in their careers are only now -- or only recently, in the case of Michaud, coming out and feeling they can talk openly in this way.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 I think the way that the Michaud campaign describes the situation is that he would be the first openly gay governor who\xe2\x80\x99s elected to office.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there has been an openly gay serving governor, but I think the way that they describe it is he would be the first one elected.</p>\n<p>I think all of this is evidence of the broader social change that is sweeping the country, that there is much greater acceptance and tolerance of those who are openly gay.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- the President certainly believes -- well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this topic have obviously -- on this issue have changed over the years.\xc2\xa0 And I think the changes that the President has discussed in his own views and feelings are very similar to the kinds of changes and opinion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from people all across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mrs. Obama is in Rhode Island today and the President is going there tonight.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance they would meet or have dinner or anything like that later on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I believe that she is going to -- will have already appeared in Rhode Island and left by the time that we get there.\xc2\xa0 But if that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back and let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any more events -- any more campaign events Monday and Tuesday before the election?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that we have to announce right now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, would you have sent him home?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you have sent him home?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Would I have -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I did note that -- I think it was Nate Silver that tweeted had he been waved home, and whether he had made it safely or been thrown out at home, it would have gone down as one of the five most exciting plays in the history of baseball.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Quite a way to end a one-run game seven World Series game to have somebody thrown out at the plate, or to score the game-tying run, inside-the-park homerun.</p>\n<p>I think, more broadly, the Royals had a tremendous season.\xc2\xa0 I know that all my fellow Kansas Cityians are exceedingly proud of the hometown baseball team.\xc2\xa0 They really electrified that city in a way that I think even the Mayor himself would say we haven\'t seen in a long time in Kansas City.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think the people of Kansas City are really three things.\xc2\xa0 One is disappointment in the outcome of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game.\xc2\xa0 The second is a lot of satisfaction in a thrilling playoff run.\xc2\xa0 And the third thing I think that people are doing in Kansas City -- the people of Kansas City are doing today is already counting down the days to the start of spring training.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:37 P.M.
