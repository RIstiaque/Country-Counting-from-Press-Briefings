Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:05 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Hump Day. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Before we get started, let me just do a little thing at the top. \xc2\xa0I think many of you may have had an opportunity to watch the testimony of Secretary Carter who was testifying before the Senate Arms Service Committee today. \xc2\xa0And he had an important message to deliver. \xc2\xa0He spent a significant period of time laying out the efforts that have been underway for more than a year to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0He also had an opportunity to talk through the efforts that had been intensified in recent weeks to capitalize on progress that\xe2\x80\x99s already been made against ISIL and Iraq and Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he talked about a range of things. \xc2\xa0He talked about the recent and new commitment from our allies in Germany, France and the UK to our coalition military mission. \xc2\xa0He talked about the important progress that Iraqi security forces are making and how they benefitted from the backing of the United States and our coalition partners, particularly in the ongoing effort to retake Ramadi. \xc2\xa0He laid out the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to create an expeditionary task force that would be based in Iraq but equipped to carry out missions that have previously killed -- equipped to carry out the kinds of missions that have previously killed ISIL leaders and uncovered treasure troves of intelligence.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President also talked about -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Secretary Carter also talked about the decision of the President to deploy U.S. special operators to Syria. \xc2\xa0These special operators can serve as force-multipliers to support the ongoing efforts of the Syrian-Arab coalition fighters on the ground that have already driven ISIL out of nearly 900 square-kilometers in northeastern Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think all of that is a good reminder, and this is a good occasion for us to once again consider the commitment and heroism of our men and women in uniform. \xc2\xa0And here in this holiday season, it\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate time for us to pause to consider the sacrifice that they\xe2\x80\x99re making for our country and for our national security, and offer them our gratitude.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll say that stands in quite stark contrast to the conduct of Congress. \xc2\xa0Secretary Carter also noted in his testimony that Congress, despite repeated requests, is blocking more than $116 million in funding for precisely the equipping operation that the Department of Defense is trying to carry out in northeastern Syria. \xc2\xa0This is equipment and materials that have previously been used by local opposition fighters inside of Syria, as I pointed out, to drive ISIL out of nearly 900 square-kilometers of space in northeastern Syria. \xc2\xa0And the Department of Defense has been asking for weeks now for additional funds to resupply that effort and try to continue the progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Congress, inexplicably, has not acted. \xc2\xa0In fact, they have actually tried to block this funding from going through. \xc2\xa0And at a time when our men and women in uniform are bearing so much of a burden to protect this country, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Congress to do something to actually help them. \xc2\xa0And hopefully they will do that before they leave for their own holiday break, a holiday break that our men and women in uniform -- at least those who are deployed to Iraq and in Syria -- will not have the opportunity to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that sober reminder, Kathleen, you want to start us off with questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I wanted to start, actually, with other testimonies in the House this morning. \xc2\xa0Director Comey\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that the shooters in the San Bernardino massacre were radicalized for at least two years, and one of them likely before she arrived in the U.S. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, now that we have those details, if you think this was an intelligence failure of some sort. \xc2\xa0And if you have any more specifics on what kind of changes to the K-1 visa program you\xe2\x80\x99re considering given that she appears to have slipped through on a visa, and whatever safeguards there didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch her political views.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s still too early to make any grand pronouncements about what could have been done differently to prevent this terrorist attack from occurring. \xc2\xa0But this investigation is ongoing, and there is more relevant information to be learned. \xc2\xa0There continues to be a significant effort underway to learn that information -- to learn about the backgrounds of these individuals; to learn about what their motivation may have been; to determine what links, if any, they may have had to extremists overseas. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere continues to be work to determine what were the circumstances of the individual who is not an American citizen entering the country. \xc2\xa0And the President has tasked both the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security, two agencies that are involved in administering the K-1 visa program, to take a close look at the screening measures that are in place, and determine what sort of reforms need to be instituted to enhance our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So are you saying it is still possible that there were direct links to networks overseas, that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, the FBI is leading the investigation, and I think what they have said thus far is that they have not determined that either of these individuals were part of a network or cell inside the United States, and were not part of a, at least thus far, were not determined to have been directed specifically by any sort of overseas extremist terrorist organization. \xc2\xa0But all that continues to be under investigation, and there obviously is a lot that\xe2\x80\x99s been learned just in the seven days since this terrorist attack took place. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to learn everything that they possibly can to determine what led to this incident and what steps could have been imposed to try to prevent it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And I wanted to ask you about the -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a draft of the climate change deal that (inaudible) Paris negotiations. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re still working and have two more days to the deadline, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still some very big issues not decided, particularly about how developing countries -- whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to contribute to help (inaudible) to pay for some of these changes. \xc2\xa0Even some of the long-term goal is not quite fleshed out. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the draft is, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re at all worried that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to meet the deadline.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\'t gotten a detailed briefing on the latest draft. \xc2\xa0The word that I have received back from Paris is that there is still a lot of work to be done. \xc2\xa0But the momentum is moving in the right direction. \xc2\xa0And you did see Secretary Kerry announce earlier today, Paris time, a significant increase in the commitment that the United States was prepared to make in investments that would assist communities that are struggling to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the leadership role that the United States continues to play in these negotiations, and those kinds of enhanced commitments will be instrumental in building momentum to a positive outcome. \xc2\xa0But there is still a lot of work that remains to be done. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably true -- there probably are at least a couple more sleepless nights facing our negotiators before there\xe2\x80\x99s any good news to report.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make the deadline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make any predictions. \xc2\xa0But again, the last briefing that I got from my colleagues in Paris is that the momentum is moving in the right direction. \xc2\xa0But important and significant work remains done -- remains to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, and then just one last quick one. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks on the Hill, there were some comments that seemed you could interpret them as pointed at Donald Trump, in particular about respecting faiths of all backgrounds with different last names. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments were particularly aimed at Donald Trump and, if so, why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- if he feels so strongly about it, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just name him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President went and gave remarks to mark the 150th anniversary of the implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that outlaws slavery. \xc2\xa0And the remarks that the President delivered sounded quite familiar to those of you who have been covering the President for a number of years -- that this commitment that we have as a nation to equal opportunity and refusing to discriminate against people just because of what their last name is, or what they look like, or who they love, or what religion they observe has been a consistent part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to the country. \xc2\xa0And that was true when he was a candidate for this office. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been true while he\xe2\x80\x99s served in this office. \xc2\xa0It was true while he was a candidate for reelection. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that this will be an important part of the message that he will continue to amplify over his remaining year in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wave you off consideration of the idea that that message stands in quite stark contrast to the rhetoric that we hear from a variety of Republican candidates for President. \xc2\xa0So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for you to notice the difference in those messages, but I would contest the notion that this is something that the President newly inserted into his remarks to respond to one individual. \xc2\xa0This is something that the President has been advocating for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when he sort of emphasized birthright citizenship, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t directly related to Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to cover the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think this is quite consistent with the message the President has been delivering for a number of years. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a message that has resonated with a significant majority of the American population and, yes, it stands in quite stark contrast to the language, message, and values that\xe2\x80\x99s being promulgated not just by Mr. Trump, but by a variety of Republican candidates in the presidential field.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House think that online lenders should be subject to more regulation or scrutiny, given that the couple behind the California shooting took out a sizeable loan from an online lender just ahead of the attack?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is certainly some of the financial transactions -- the financial history of these two individuals is something that continues to be under investigation by the FBI. \xc2\xa0Again, they\xe2\x80\x99re considering every aspect of this terrible tragedy to learn as much as they can about the incident, about the individuals, about what may have motivated them, and certainly there may be financial transactions that are relevant to that ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what those investigators have learned, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements about any financial policy or regulatory decisions that are made as a result of that investigation at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So can you say whether this is an area, though, that the White House would consider looking at, separate from the investigation, as the White House looks at what could be done differently, what policies need to change to sort of prevent anything similar from happening in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant wing of the Treasury Department right across the street that\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated to combatting illicit finance. \xc2\xa0And certainly these are kinds of questions that are considered every day by officials in the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0This is a convenient way for me to remind you once again that the individual -- the financial expert that the President has appointed to lead that division of the Treasury Department is somebody of impeccable credentials who has not -- credentials that have not been questioned by anybody in either party. \xc2\xa0He is somebody who has served Presidents of both parties, and yet, Republicans in Congress have been blocking his nomination for more than a year. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve raised the concern about this Republican obstruction in the United States Senate for a while now in the context of the need for us to focus on shutting down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing -- that certainly is one important part of the Illicit Finance Division at the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut they also have a counterterrorism responsibility, and they are actively engaged in shutting down efforts to finance terrorism. \xc2\xa0Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot to be learned in the context of this investigation, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to jump to any conclusions. \xc2\xa0But if there are Republicans in the United States Senate who are concerned about this, there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one tangible thing they can do that certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require anything extraordinary, it only requires them to do the job of confirming highly qualified nominees to important national security positions in the United States government. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans in Congress have been delinquent about that. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s because of their, frankly, disconcerting willingness to put their own political and partisan priorities ahead of our national security, and it\xe2\x80\x99s got to stop. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, what\xe2\x80\x99s your sense today -- can you give us an update today of where things are at in terms of negotiations with the Hill on the CR omnibus? \xc2\xa0Are there any signs of optimism about --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, these are negotiations that continue between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0The last I heard is there continues to be a willingness on the part of Republicans to try to use the budgetary process to advance their ideological agenda by putting ideological riders into the bill. \xc2\xa0These are essentially poison pills that Democrats find objectionable, and Republicans have shut down the government once before by inserting poison pills into the budget process. \xc2\xa0That was only two years ago. \xc2\xa0And they were counting on their ability to either pass a budget along strictly party lines or to get Democrats to go along with ideological poison pills even in the face of a government shutdown. \xc2\xa0And I think the American people were quite clear that that was something they didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t prove to be a particularly effective strategy for Republicans in the past. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful, before we reach the deadline, that Republicans will abandon that strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to go back to the 13th Amendment speech by the President. \xc2\xa0In his statement -- and you say it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily inserted for Donald Trump -- but you had some strong statements yesterday about Donald Trump; you called him by name. \xc2\xa0The President strategically did not call his name, he talked around Donald Trump. \xc2\xa0Why is he not calling him out? \xc2\xa0I mean, you from that podium with the White House insignia behind you said it. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re the presidential spokesman -- why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President say anything about Donald Trump, call his name?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what the President spoke about today on Capitol Hill was a forceful and passionate defense of the kinds of values that our country has long defended. \xc2\xa0And while serving in this office and even before serving in this office, the President took up the mantle of defending for and advocating for those values. \xc2\xa0And at each turn over the course of our country\xe2\x80\x99s history, where we have perceived that our country has fallen short of our commitment to those values, we have, even in the face of significant obstacles, summoned the courage and the tenacity to overcome those obstacles and form a more perfect union. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s worth celebrating, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was talking about today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the last couple of months, I guess since Donald Trump has been here and even before then, there seems to be more of a visible uptick on issues of race. \xc2\xa0Is this White House willing to acknowledge that there is more on the table when it comes to issues of race now because of the rhetoric; that there is a tension, a racial tension that might be escalating in this country because of this rhetoric, be it black, white, be it Muslim or people from other countries versus white America? \xc2\xa0I mean, is there an acknowledgement that there is some kind of increase in a tension, racial tension in this country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the willingness of high-profile candidates for office in the Republican Party to use divisive, offensive rhetoric that appeals to people\xe2\x80\x99s fears and anxieties is counterproductive. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the country stronger, and it certainly is a calculated political strategy to try to divide the country to advance their campaign. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s cynical, it\xe2\x80\x99s repugnant, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President and other people have spoken out against on a number of occasions. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you are acknowledging that this White House is noticing an uptick in racial issues on the negative side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m acknowledging that there has been a calculated political strategy on the part of some high-profile Republican candidates for office to try to divide the country to advance their political ambition, and I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back to the San Bernardino shootings and what Director Comey said. \xc2\xa0He said that they had been radicalized even before they were courting online, so very substantially in advance of the wife\xe2\x80\x99s admission over the K-1 visa program. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you actually answer the first part of Kathleen\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0Is that not an intelligence failure that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t caught?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well -- and what I said to Kathleen is that it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to determine, to make that determination.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, but Director Comey didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell that. \xc2\xa0He said that that was the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Then you can go ask him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s an intelligence failure? \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re not able to say that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to say that from here I guess. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re seven days into the investigation and what that investigation is hoping to discern is exactly what transpired, what led to this action, and whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that could have been done in advance to stop it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you not understand that -- the fact -- assuming what Director Comey said is fact, that the fact that it was not caught is terribly worrisome to people who see that we have this program that admits people from overseas and didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch it in that case, that that is worrisome?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why the President, even before these details of the investigation become public, that the President ordered a review of the program to determine if there are some changes to the program that could be implemented that would enhance our national security. \xc2\xa0So this is certainly something that the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the same subject -- do you feel like knowing that -- I mean, whether we call it an intelligence failure or not, this is a program that some people are going to be able to slip through. \xc2\xa0We know that pretty much on its face. \xc2\xa0If somebody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a record or if they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sign of being radicalized, even if they are radicalized, they might still get through. \xc2\xa0So do you have a concern that this is just going to add fuel to that fire, the rhetoric that\xe2\x80\x99s been out there against admitting people at all, against admitting refugees? \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like there\xe2\x80\x99s a real line that anyone can designate of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to work and what\xe2\x80\x99s going to protect the country and what\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Michelle, I think one area of encouragement, one source of encouragement for the administration was the legislative action that was taken by the House of Representatives just yesterday to implement some reforms to the visa waiver program. \xc2\xa0These are reforms that the administration advocated. \xc2\xa0Some of them are reforms that were actually implemented to the program based on administrative changes using the administration\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the administration that that\xe2\x80\x99s the most effective way to protect the country and to correct some potential vulnerabilities in the system. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was widespread bipartisan support for this legislation in the House. \xc2\xa0I think it got more than 400 votes. \xc2\xa0That certainly is, in my mind, is an encouraging sign that both Democrats and Republicans in Congress take quite seriously the responsibility that they have to confront this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that, too. \xc2\xa0Because it\xe2\x80\x99s something -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a movement toward tighter security -- and, of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s always a good thing; that\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0I mean, few could argue with that. \xc2\xa0But I think everybody also looks at it and knows that people who are part of the visa waiver program for other countries -- travels they haven\'t been to -- they\xe2\x80\x99re able to come through without as much security. \xc2\xa0And at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing these reports about ISIS supporters who are now able to get into Europe -- I think \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually unimpeded\xe2\x80\x9d was the word that one administration official used just in the last few days. \xc2\xa0So, I mean, do you worry that this is an action but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be enough? \xc2\xa0Or are you thinking wear do you draw the line? \xc2\xa0Because you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at one specific part of a certain category of travelers\xe2\x80\x99 backgrounds, but there are other people that are part of the visa waiver program that are able to come through with far less scrutiny.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Michelle, what the reforms to the visa waiver program would do is they would impose more significant, more rigorous screening standards on a variety of travelers, including travelers who had recently traveled to a war zone.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that enough, though -- I guess is the simple way of asking this question. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think there are other things that we would like to see as well. \xc2\xa0One of the other things that we have said -- and this is something that the President said in a news conference when he was sitting next to President Hollande three weeks ago -- is that there is more that we would like our European partners to do to share information and share intelligence with us. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s also more information -- or, frankly, more that our European partners need to do in terms of sharing information among themselves, but then also sharing that information with the United States so we can work even more effectively together to protect our borders and to protect our citizens. \xc2\xa0So there are some additional things that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see done here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And is he hearing from Carter again today? \xc2\xa0And you mentioning sort of what\xe2\x80\x99s working and what\xe2\x80\x99s helping in the fight against ISIS, what you hear less of now than we did in the beginning was all the things that our Arab partners are doing -- so as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing less. \xc2\xa0So what is the plan to get them to do more? \xc2\xa0And do you that\xe2\x80\x99s realistically going to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is something that Secretary Carter also mentioned in his opening testimony. \xc2\xa0He noted that there were additional commitments that we would like to see from some of our Arab partners, even in the context of our military campaign. \xc2\xa0And he did express some concern that some of those partners have been distracted by the ongoing conflict in Yemen. \xc2\xa0So there certainly is more that our partners in the region can do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of them are already bearing a significant burden. \xc2\xa0Some of them are already housing a million or more refugees from Syria. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to work effectively with our counterparts in the UAE to advance some of our online efforts to counter ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s messaging on social media. \xc2\xa0That is a valuable contribution from our Emirati partners. \xc2\xa0So there are some non-military steps that have been important. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen our partners in the region play an important role in trying to advance the diplomatic process. \xc2\xa0In fact, even as we speak, there is a meeting in Riyadh of a large variety of Syrian opposition groups that are trying to advance the process of unifying that opposition so that they can engage in a political transition process that\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a variety of ways that our Arab partners have contributed to this effort, and we certainly are appreciative of that. \xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99re right, there\xe2\x80\x99s more that they could do.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just follow on that? \xc2\xa0You said there\xe2\x80\x99s more that you\xe2\x80\x99d like the European partners to do on intelligence-sharing. \xc2\xa0Can you cite what that is? \xc2\xa0And has the flow not improved since the Paris attacks, like you would like it to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think there are a variety of things that we would like them to do. \xc2\xa0I think many of them are difficult to talk about because they have to do with intelligence information. \xc2\xa0But I can give you one example. \xc2\xa0There is something that\xe2\x80\x99s often referred to as PNR -- these are passenger name records -- and we believe that many of our European partners could do a better job of collecting that information in the first place, sharing that with other Europeans in the second place, and then in the third instance, do a more effective and efficient job of sharing that information with the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is more that can be done, and it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of all -- it falls largely in that realm. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s just sort of one example that we can talk about. \xc2\xa0And again, the President made a specific reference to this in his news conference with President Hollande.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What do you think is the holdup? \xc2\xa0What gets in the way of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think there are a couple of things that get in the way of that. \xc2\xa0I think one is sort of the complicated nature of the way that Europe is governed. \xc2\xa0These are different countries that have open borders, and so that poses some unique challenges in terms of securing their country and securing the continent. \xc2\xa0There obviously is a roiling debate in Europe about where to draw the line in terms of balancing national security and privacy. \xc2\xa0And those kinds of debates are not easily resolved. \xc2\xa0There have been some roiling debates here in this country about the best way to resolve that, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Europe as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut frankly, we believe that there is more that could be done on the national security side that would strengthen the national security not just of our European allies, but also of the United States that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in and of itself significantly undermine the basic universal right to privacy that the United States and our allies share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Back to the omnibus. \xc2\xa0If I could just dig in a little bit. \xc2\xa0Riders obviously appear to be the sticking point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I could just ask about one in particular to see if it\xe2\x80\x99s ideological or not. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that a number of Democrats are joining Republicans in a rider that would block the NLRB, for example, from enforcing the Joint Employer Liability Rule. \xc2\xa0Do you consider that ideological?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say, Cheryl, that the concern that we have here is that there has been a tendency on the part of Republicans to try to advance their ideological agenda through the budgetary process because they haven\'t been able to otherwise advance some of the controversial policies that, for ideological reasons, they have prioritized.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a good example of one. \xc2\xa0For ideological reasons, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans essentially work aggressively to undermine the right of workers to form unions. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that the President disagrees with. \xc2\xa0And the notion that Republicans are prepared to shut down the government unless the President goes along and Democrats in Congress go along with their effort to make it harder for workers at a fast food company to organize collectively to advocate for higher wages I think is in some ways the best example of Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 misplaced priorities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the sort of -- walking through the list of things that we would find objectionable enough to veto in the budget bill. \xc2\xa0But we obviously would be opposed to any effort by Republicans in Congress to insert that measure into the budget bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have a sense of how many riders are sort of still in play that are particularly objectionable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good sense of the count. \xc2\xa0I know that as recently as a week or so ago, there were several dozen. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the latest tally is, or who\xe2\x80\x99s holding the piece of paper with the comprehensive list. \xc2\xa0That person is probably not getting a lot of sleep either. \xc2\xa0But there clearly has been, from the beginning, an effort on the part of Republicans to include a large number of ideological riders in the budget bill. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, as I mentioned -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve previously observed, I do think that is an indication that the Republican record in Congress is a pretty sorry state of affairs when it comes to what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to achieve legislatively over the course of this year with a newfound, significant, widened Republican majority in the House, and a brand-new majority in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And I think this is animating a lot of the rhetoric that we even see in the Republican town hall meetings that candidates are convening in places like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. \xc2\xa0And I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d make the same observation, but for slightly different reasons. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And finally, just because there\xe2\x80\x99s only three days left until the deadline -- I mean, do you have any -- well, first of all, I guess, is the President still determined to keep the December 11th deadline as --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0Republicans and Democrats in Congress have had ample time to negotiate this agreement. \xc2\xa0And the President is not going to sign a continuing resolution that gives them additional weeks or months to negotiate an agreement. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve already had weeks and months to negotiate an agreement. \xc2\xa0And the only reason that we haven\'t come to an agreement is the continued insistence on the part of Republicans to insert ideological riders into the process. \xc2\xa0This could be solved in advance of the deadline if Republicans abandon that approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask you about a budgetary matter that my colleagues on the Hill tell me is still actively being negotiated on that, but is of special importance to you all. \xc2\xa0Is the White House willing to accept any changes in the Affordable Care Act, including repeal of the Cadillac tax or the medical device tax as part of either the spending bill or a tax extenders bill? \xc2\xa0And likewise, also a budgetary matter -- would you all be willing to accept a provision that requires the risk corridors of the Affordable Care Act to be budget-neutral?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mike, we have essentially made the case -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot there, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to collect my thoughts here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Tampering with the Affordable Care Act is the bottom line.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yeah. \xc2\xa0And I think the bottom line here is that we are interested in working with Congress to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0That has been our goal all along, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been open to proposals from Democrats or Republicans that would serve that goal. \xc2\xa0For too long, we have actually seen Republicans repeatedly, dozens of times, put forward proposals that would undermine, eliminate, repeal, replace -- pick the verb --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) just Republican. \xc2\xa0The unions are for the Cadillac tax. \xc2\xa0Some Democrats want to get --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly strongly oppose the notion of repealing the Cadillac tax. \xc2\xa0So look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to answer sort of all of the rumors on Capitol Hill about the status of budget negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell us if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to accept any changes to the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about our desire to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it, replace it, or whatever other action verb some Republicans may choose.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One other question. \xc2\xa0In his call with Prime Minister Modi of India last night, did the President preview his proposal from Secretary Kerry today to expand the amount of money available to developing nations? \xc2\xa0And did Modi have any reaction to that? \xc2\xa0Did that narrow your differences over a climate agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more detailed readout of their call to share with you. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that, in general, that U.S. support both in the public sector and the private sector for efforts to assist countries as they adapt to the impacts of climate change is something that President Obama and Prime Minister Modi have discussed extensively over the last several weeks and months. \xc2\xa0This was something that was discussed extensively when the President sat down face-to-face with Prime Minister Modi just last week when they were both in Paris. \xc2\xa0So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it came up in their conversation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we are seeking is, given our commitment -- the commitment of the United States to those kinds of investments -- we want to make sure that there is also a commitment on the part of the Indians and the other 180 or so countries that have showed up to Paris to make serious down payments on cutting carbon pollution, and that a commitment to doing that is not automatically in direct conflict with the kind of economic priorities that many of those countries have identified for themselves. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think you can tell us about the progress? \xc2\xa0Because clearly, Modi, in India, had the biggest people that Americans might consider the obstacle, but the biggest places we have with on the climate control agreement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would describe them as the biggest obstacle necessarily. \xc2\xa0Anytime you negotiate an agreement with more than 180 countries, there are going to be a lot of issues to work through. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that statement is quite entirely fair to the Indians. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that there has been a concerted effort on the part of the United States, starting at the level of the President, but also including the rest of our negotiating team to seek common ground with the Indians and to reassure them about our commitment to investments moving forward and helping countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, but also making sure that those countries are demonstrating a commitment of their own to reducing carbon polluting, and joining the rest of the world in the fight against climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a couple quick follow-ups. \xc2\xa0One, on Ash Carter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, the other thing that came up -- he was asked directly if he thought ISIS has been contained, and his answer was no. \xc2\xa0Does the President disagree with his Defense Secretary? \xc2\xa0Because that directly contradicts, of course, what the President said a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t directly contradict what the President said several days ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, the President said ISIS had been contained, and his Defense Secretary said ISIS has not been contained. \xc2\xa0That sounds like a direct contradiction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, if you take a look at the transcript of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, which I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, because he did the interview with ABC --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0ABC News, yes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And the President was quite clear about how it is a fact -- one that Secretary Carter actually indicated that he did agree with -- that ISIS is no longer making significant advances across territory throughout Iraq and in Syria, and that those advances had been contained and, in fact, rolled back in some key areas. \xc2\xa0One area where they\xe2\x80\x99ve been rolled back is in northeastern Syria, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress in rolling them back from 900 square-kilometers of territory, but yet Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t fund the effort to keep up that momentum.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President also acknowledged in that interview and subsequently that there are significant challenges when it comes to controlling the spread of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s radical ideology. \xc2\xa0And the United States is engaged in a coherent strategy to confront that. \xc2\xa0And one example of that is the recent Department of Defense strike that we know now succeeded in taking the ISIL leader in Libya off the battlefield.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, so what\xe2\x80\x99s the distinction here? \xc2\xa0The President saying ISIS is contained in Iraq and in Syria, and his Defense Secretary is saying ISIS is not contained elsewhere in the world? \xc2\xa0Is that the distinction? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to -- because the President said his contained, his Defense Secretary said not contained. \xc2\xa0So, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying both are true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is I think that Secretary Carter indicated that he agreed with the viewpoint that was put forward by Secretary -- or by General Dunford who, again, also said the same thing that the President did in describing ISIL as contained tactically in areas that they have been in, in Iraq and in Syria, but strategically concerned about their capacity to spread. \xc2\xa0Again, that is why, for example, the Department of Defense has taken air strikes in Libya to take the ISIL leader off the battlefield in Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m really just trying to understand. \xc2\xa0So contained in Iraq and in Syria, but not contained elsewhere? \xc2\xa0Is that the position of the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to go back to exactly what the President said. \xc2\xa0We have had success, undeniably, in limiting the ability of ISIL to take over additional large patches of territory inside of Iraq. \xc2\xa0This military conflict has been characterized by some back and forth. \xc2\xa0But the statistic that our intelligence community and our military often cites is that ISIL is no longer in control of 25 percent of the populated area that they previously had taken over. \xc2\xa0That is evidence of ISIL being contained in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also why we are continuing to apply pressure to them. \xc2\xa0The whole reason that the President ordered military operations against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria was the concern that they could establish a safe haven there that they could then use to carry out attacks in other places. \xc2\xa0This is a concern that the President has had since day one, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s executed the military strategy that he has to combat them and ultimately destroy them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then I want to follow up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today and Donald Trump. \xc2\xa0When the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe betray the efforts of the past if we fail to push back against bigotry in all its forms,\xe2\x80\x9d was he in any way referring to Donald Trump and the latest controversy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what the President was giving voice to are the kinds of values that have animated his career in public service. \xc2\xa0This was true even before he ran for President. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk to him at some point about his remarks today. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him about whether or not he specifically included those words for that reason. \xc2\xa0I just want to point out that those words are not new, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the first time that he has shared that view. \xc2\xa0In fact, this sentiment, these values have been part of his public remarks in a variety of circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one last thing. \xc2\xa0The Supreme Court today in the Fisher v. University of Texas case on affirmative action, Justice Scalia made some comments from the bench saying that affirmative action may not be in the interest of all African Americans. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMost of the black scientists in this country do not come from the most advanced schools, and have benefitted from \xe2\x80\x98a slower track.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And he went on to say they\xe2\x80\x99re being pushed into schools that are too advanced for them. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you had any reaction to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s words on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like something that I would agree with, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just hearing them for the first time, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take a look at those comments and maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a response. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you bring them back tomorrow? \xc2\xa0Can you bring some comments back on that tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do. \xc2\xa0Mara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to try Mike\xe2\x80\x99s question again to make sure I understood. \xc2\xa0You said you strongly oppose the notion of repealing the Cadillac tax. \xc2\xa0Does that mean he would veto it if there was a repeal in there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As I mentioned to Cheryl earlier, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go down the list of \xe2\x80\x9cthis is what we\xe2\x80\x99ll veto and this is what we won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to do my best to try to describe to you the position that we have on these matters, but once we see a final bill then we can give you some guidance about whether or not the President is going to sign it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is it fair to say that although you\xe2\x80\x99re opposed to repealing it -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether you would veto things that chip away at it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what we have -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t said what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to veto or not veto about any of this -- any of the Affordable Care Act stuff or any of the efforts to chip away at the rights of working people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I can do is I can try to describe to you as best I can our position on these issues. \xc2\xa0And our position is that we would welcome efforts from any Democratic or any Republican that has a desire to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And repealing the Cadillac tax is not a way to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you strongly oppose that. \xc2\xa0Do you strongly oppose repealing the medical device tax?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, our view is that one of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act is that it contributes significantly to deficit reduction, and that imposing that tax is one way that we enjoy that benefit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And speaking of deficit reduction, what about making risk corridors benefit -- budget-neutral? \xc2\xa0Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what opponents of that argue, that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is. \xc2\xa0And this is -- the risk corridors policy is one that is rather complicated, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to HHS and CMS in terms of helping you understand exactly what we believe is the best way to strengthen that program in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the interests of people who are benefitting from the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, should processing of K-1 visas be slowed or stopped until this White House-ordered review is completed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right now, this is something for the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to consider. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure at what pace they\xe2\x80\x99re being issued right now. \xc2\xa0So for an update on that, I\xe2\x80\x99d check with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So at this point -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say whether there\xe2\x80\x99s an intelligence failure related to San Bernardino, but is it still too early to say whether Tashfeen Malik should have been allowed into this country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, the circumstances that allowed this individual, who\xe2\x80\x99s not an American citizen, to enter the United States is something that is under careful review, not just by the FBI but also, as it relates to their involvement in this process, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new conclusions to share with you about that investigation at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Despite the fact that the FBI Director did say that this radicalization took part well in advance of the timeline for her having been vetted and interviewed and given a visa prior to entry into the U.S.? \xc2\xa0At this point you don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything that should have tripped a wire, raised a flag that should have prevented her from entering?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what is under investigation right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But because it\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you -- switching to Carter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony as well -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the President, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from you this call for a new AUMF and the need for it. \xc2\xa0Operationally, what do you need from a new AUMF that you don\xe2\x80\x99t already have since legally you believe that the fight is justified under the existing authorities? \xc2\xa0Operationally, what becomes different if you get what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The Department of Defense I think has spoken to this already. \xc2\xa0And I think that what they have articulated is that there is -- that they are able to do everything that the President has ordered them to do based on the authority that the President has been given by Congress under the 2001 AUMF.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that the President has been advocating for more than a year now that Congress pass an authorization to use military force is it would send a very forceful signal to our citizens, to our men and women in uniform, to our allies, and, yes, our adversaries that the United States is united behind the priority of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a congressional responsibility. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking them to do something that they\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to do. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking them to do something that isn\xe2\x80\x99t directly part of their job description. \xc2\xa0And the fact that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done it is a source of significant disappointment here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing is symbolic importance. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not anything operationally different. \xc2\xa0It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change what U.S. forces are doing, is what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You should check with the Department of Defense to confirm this; it\xe2\x80\x99s an operational question. \xc2\xa0But my understanding about what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that they are able to carry out all the orders that the President has given them based on the authorization to use military force that Congress gave the executive branch back in 2001. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the executive branch is seeking -- and I think the Department of Defense would say they would welcome the show of support from Congress -- is the Congress acting to demonstrate the unanimity of opinion inside the United States about the priority of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it is correct to say \xe2\x80\x9csymbolically important\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It surely is symbolically important. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also a basic congressional responsibility that they have put off for more than a year despite the fact they, on a daily basis, criticize others -- including the Secretary of Defense -- for the way he has handled his business when it comes to countering ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have plans to hold further consultations or new drafts on what they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see in the new AUMF? \xc2\xa0Because previous attempts haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone anywhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you cited previous attempts. \xc2\xa0The administration back in February put forward our own legislative language when it came to -- for an authorization to use military force.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And a lot of Democrats --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s partisan. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this is a congressional responsibility. \xc2\xa0And it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just that we put forward legislative language. \xc2\xa0It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just that the President has been consistently publicly advocating for congressional action in this regard. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s that the President also sent senior members of his national security team, including the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, to go to Congress and talk to them on the record, under oath, in public about why this legislation is important.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in the face of all of that, Congress has done absolutely nothing other than criticize, I suppose.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think the arguments have been effective? \xc2\xa0Or you\xe2\x80\x99re putting the fault back with them on --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, considering this is a specific responsibility of the United States Congress, I recognize that they may want to point fingers to avoid some blame. \xc2\xa0But when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Congress not doing their job, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to determine who else might be at fault.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you quickly just say whether the White House is prepared to confirm that Iran tested a ballistic missile last month?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Margaret, I can tell you that these are reports that we have seen, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these reports, as well. \xc2\xa0And the United States government is looking into them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Our intelligence community, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, is one of the best. \xc2\xa0So one would think that it\xe2\x80\x99s more than reports --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Indeed they are. \xc2\xa0I think the best, even.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But when the intelligence community recognized that Iran tested a missile in -- a month prior to that, and Iran also acknowledged that it tested a ballistic missile back in October, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any consequence for Iran, other than a complaint at the U.N. \xc2\xa0Is there any follow up on that? \xc2\xa0I mean, should we have a follow-up on the October test if we\xe2\x80\x99re not acknowledging the November one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think there has -- I would disagree with the notion that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any consequences. \xc2\xa0On October 21st, the United States condemned the violation and submitted a joint report with France, Germany and the U.K. to the U.N. Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s Iran Sanctions Committee. \xc2\xa0We called for the committee to review the matter and take appropriate action.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust last month, together with the British and the French, we also proposed that the committee push Iran for a formal explanation. \xc2\xa0Many of the entities that were involved in that prior missile launch are already subject to sanctions by the United States. \xc2\xa0And the President has been talking for at least since this summer about steps the United States can do to deepen our security cooperation with our partners in the region, to better counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the ongoing security consultations that are taking place between, for example, the United States and the GCC countries. \xc2\xa0They obviously have a vested interest in countering this illicit missile program. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s more that can be done and more that we\xe2\x80\x99re actively doing and have been doing, frankly, since before this latest confirmed test back in October.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When I said no consequence I meant no sanctions, other than complaint.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And some of it is that they\xe2\x80\x99re already sanctioned. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re already seeking to work -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re already seeking to deepen our cooperation with our partners to counter this program.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, this is a -- the Iran ballistic missile program is something that\xe2\x80\x99s been a source of concern for years now, and it continues to be. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we closely monitor, as you suggested, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we talk about on a regular basis with our partners and allies in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on the AUMF for a moment. \xc2\xa0A lot has changed since the President submitted the language to Congress that he thought should be in the AUMF. \xc2\xa0Is what he was talking about on Sunday basically the same thing? \xc2\xa0In other words, does the White House think that that is still the proposal that Congress should take when it comes to authorizing force if they were to do something on this now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We continue to support the legislative language that we put forward back in February. \xc2\xa0The steps that the President has ordered are entirely consistent with that language that we put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also indicated a willingness to negotiate that language; that if there are Democrats and Republicans that want to get together and have some conversations about how to more effectively, in their view, word an authorization to use military force, we\xe2\x80\x99d welcome those kinds of conversations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I guess -- this is what I keep going back to -- is that ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to write this bill and to build support for it, vote on it and pass it. \xc2\xa0And Congress has done very little, if anything, in pursuit of those goals. \xc2\xa0And again, for members of Congress who have spent a lot of time talking to all of you, appearing on cable television, criticizing the administration for our response to the counter-ISIL campaign, it\xe2\x80\x99s still hard for them to point to anything tangibly that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to help this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now, we know they\xe2\x80\x99re blocking funding for an equipping program that would benefit forces that are actually working effectively with the United States to push back on ISIL. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to take what even is a symbolic step, as Margaret described it, to demonstrate their support for our ongoing efforts. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to confirm the highly qualified individual that has served President in both parties that would lead the effort to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty broad list of concerns. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to me exactly what members of Congress would say that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure. \xc2\xa0And right now, I guess to make matters worse, they\xe2\x80\x99re also on the verge of shutting down the government, which would also risk funding for national security and homeland security.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Congress to get to work. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But a lot has changed in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Iraq and Syria since you guys sent that language up to the Hill. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve presumably learned a lot about what ISIL is doing and how our efforts are succeeding and falling short. \xc2\xa0So you would think that maybe there would have been some modifications that he might want to make to get the most effective AUMF he can get? \xc2\xa0Unless it really is just symbolic -- show of support for the fight.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess -- in some ways, it might show the wisdom of what we put forward back in February, the fact that it continues to be relevant and consistent with the actions that the President has taken thus far. \xc2\xa0But even when we put forward that proposal back in February, and even when senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team were testifying before Congress, there was a willingness to negotiate around it, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even gotten much of a serious effort in that regard, either.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Congress has fallen quite short in terms of fulfilling their responsibilities to demonstrate their support for the priority that the President has identified -- to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Secretary Carter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony today, is the President concerned that this is really going to deepen American involvement in Iraq beyond what he\xe2\x80\x99s been willing to consider in the past? \xc2\xa0I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ground forces, but --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When you say \xe2\x80\x9cthis,\xe2\x80\x9d what do you mean?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The potential to send attack helicopters to support the fight in Ramadi. \xc2\xa0I mean, these pilots could be fighting ground fire. \xc2\xa0I mean, this is close-in operations we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, and I wonder whether there\xe2\x80\x99s any concern on the part of the President that this is really going to draw our military involvement in beyond what he\xe2\x80\x99s been willing to consider in the past. \xc2\xa0And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then why now? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s changed on the ground to warrant that at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of thoughts here. \xc2\xa0The first is that there are already American servicemen and women in Iraq, and in some situations, in Syria, doing very dangerous things to advance our national security. \xc2\xa0And the President, as the Commander-in-Chief, feels responsible for their safety, and certainly feels responsible for any orders that he gives them that puts them in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is mindful of this whenever he considers these kinds of military options. \xc2\xa0I will say that the President has not decided to approve the use of U.S. attack helicopters in an operation like this. \xc2\xa0So that -- the President has not signed off on that. \xc2\xa0I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note what Secretary Carter said, which is that any sort of decision like this would only come at the request that is made by Prime Minister Abadi. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think all three of those things bear keeping in mind. \xc2\xa0The other thing that bears keeping in mind is that we are seeing Iraqi security forces make some modest progress in retaking Ramadi. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s imminent, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not even a foregone conclusion. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that there\xe2\x80\x99s important progress that has been made there. \xc2\xa0And given our commitment to supporting Iraqi security forces as they make progress, I suppose this is the reason that this issue came up for discussion. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99d just reiterate that any decision like this would only come at the request of Prime Minister Abadi and after explicit signoff from the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s signoff that has not been given at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Pentagon has made -- I mean, Secretary Carter has made clear he thinks this might well be necessary and the right thing to do. \xc2\xa0Does the President hold a different view?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think Secretary Carter made clear that it was an option, but he also made clear that it was an option that would, again, only make sense in the context of a specific request from Prime Minister Abadi, and certainly is only going to be something that moves forward once the President has signed off on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Can I just follow up on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If the Prime Minister were to say -- and this sounds like this would be useful -- is there any indication that you would have that the President would say no?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it depends on the circumstances. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to entertain that specific hypothetical. \xc2\xa0But I think Secretary Carter was making clear that this is an available option. \xc2\xa0But again, there are still some decisions that would have to be made before that option is one that is taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Staying with Secretary Carter\xe2\x80\x99s testimony today, he made mention of the fact that he would like coalition partners to step up, offer more in the way of munitions, weapons, et cetera. \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that our Gulf partners are not doing their fair share?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we believe that there is more that they could do. \xc2\xa0And we have welcomed additional contributions in just the last few weeks from the Germans and from the French and from the British. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, there are a number of things that our Arab partners have done previously over the course of this campaign and are still doing today that are advancing our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0But we believe that there is room for improvement and there is room for additional contributions that they could make. \xc2\xa0And this is the subject of ongoing conversations with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Couple more. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about the funding. \xc2\xa0You mentioned that Congress is simply not doing their bidding and making that money available. \xc2\xa0Can the White House guarantee a full accounting of those dollars if they were provided to make sure, obviously, that if there were materials that were purchased, that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t end up in the hands of the enemy, quite frankly, on the ground?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, there is a mechanism for providing feedback to Congress. \xc2\xa0Congress obviously has oversight over these programs, and so there is an established channel for doing precisely that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, just quickly, I want to ask you about -- there was a report that actually came out of an IG report from DHS that there were more than 70 employees for the Department of Homeland Security that had been on a terror watchlist. \xc2\xa0Are you aware of this report? \xc2\xa0Congressman Stephen Lynch mentioned it. \xc2\xa0And if that were the case, how much would that surprise the President, that people who may be on that watchlist may actually be working in that capacity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually seen that report, but let us take a look and we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one quick one on Chicago. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when you last commented on this, perhaps -- the mayor there said today that it\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cdefining moment on these issues of crime and policing, and the even larger issues of truth, justice and race.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a DOJ investigation and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a long time, but can you give us some sense of the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of concern and engagement on that particular situation? \xc2\xa0Because obviously this is something he cares deeply about. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the last year of his presidency soon. \xc2\xa0Does it take violence -- or what would it take for the President to be more demonstrative, more outspoken about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there and in other departments around the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed previously, the President does have some limitations on what he can say on this matter, given that he is the President of the United States and the Attorney General that he appointed is leading an agency that\xe2\x80\x99s conducting an independent investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to what the President said just a couple of weeks ago, shortly after this video was released, where he noted that he was deeply disturbed by the footage of the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. \xc2\xa0And he noted both that it\xe2\x80\x99s worth keeping in mind the significant loss that\xe2\x80\x99s been suffered by a lot of families across the country -- at the same time, keeping in mind our enduring gratitude to the overwhelming majority of men and women in uniform who protect our communities with honor and respect, and they do so with professionalism and they do it for the right reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, ultimately, this is a significant issue that -- even sort of stepping outside of the specific case in Chicago -- that I do think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear the President talk about some more over the course of the next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I ask again because there\xe2\x80\x99s yet another videotape, yet another case in Chicago, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99d agree that we could probably find similar evidence or problems around the country. \xc2\xa0So is -- again, and given the limitations of what he can say, what is his -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t there more that he could do? \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there more that he could -- before another American city explodes in some level of violence? \xc2\xa0Not predicting that, but obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s the concern. \xc2\xa0Why not be more proactive as opposed to reactive, which has, to some extent, been an enduring criticism of the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, I\xe2\x80\x99d remind you that earlier this year, the President convened a taskforce on 21st-century policing that brought together law enforcement experts, prosecutors, chiefs of police, but also community advocates and civil rights advocates to sit together at the table and put together essentially a list of ideas and policies and best practices that law enforcement agencies across the country could implement to improve and build trust between their officers and members of the community.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a good response from communities across the country who have taken a look at those recommendations and, in some cases, implemented them. \xc2\xa0And in some cases, it had a tangible impact on improving relations between local law enforcement and the communities they\xe2\x80\x99re sworn to serve and protect.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How engaged is that group in Chicago? \xc2\xa0I think Chief McCarthy was a member of that group and now he\xe2\x80\x99s out. \xc2\xa0Am I correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t, frankly, recall. \xc2\xa0We can take a look in that for you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Chief Ramsey was --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Chief Ramsey was in charge of it. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall whether or not Chief McCarthy was a member of that taskforce.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, again, do you know if that task force or some other aspect of the government, of the administration is actively involved in Chicago now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know the Department of Justice has community liaisons that -- beyond just the ongoing investigation, there are also community liaisons that do important work in the community with both law enforcement and community leaders to try to bridge some differences and to try to build some trust.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing, Ron, that experts would tell you about this is that inspiring and building confidence in trust in the relationship between community leaders and citizens and local law enforcement is not something that takes place overnight. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to require sustained engagement on the part of both parties to building that kind of trust. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of both sides to do that. \xc2\xa0Having trustworthy police officers walking the beat is going to make our community safer and having members of the community who trust those officers and have an effective, functioning relationship with them means that the officers are going to be safer as they do that important work. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is why I think there has been so much robust engagement by leaders on both sides of this issue to try to help everyone recognize that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of common ground to be found here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one other thing. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any evidence yet that there is a direct connect between Raqqa and San Bernardino in terms of directing, coordinating that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s correct. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence at this point. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the subject of the ongoing investigation, but thus far, there has not been.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One of the loudest criticisms or concerns by the committee when Secretary Carter was testifying was what was perceived as a lack of a plan, timetable to take that capital out, for lack of a better word. \xc2\xa0If there is a connection found, as the French apparently have found, would you think that the President would more precisely come up with a plan or a timetable -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a general plan of Sinjar -- would that be a trigger that would cause the President to initiate a sharper plan directed at the so-called capital of the caliphate? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that a lot of people would just like to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I would start by observing that if there were a timetable for a military operation against Raqqa, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that we would announce it in advance. \xc2\xa0I think Secretary Kerry -- or Secretary Kerry did discuss how continuing to apply pressure on Raqqa has been a prominent military objective of our coalition for quite some time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur coalition has been taking strikes at ISIL targets in Raqqa for more than a year now. \xc2\xa0There are ISIL leaders that have been taken off the battlefield there. \xc2\xa0There is significant infrastructure in and around Raqqa that has been destroyed by military airstrikes. \xc2\xa0So certainly continuing to apply pressure on ISIL leaders in Raqqa is a core component of our strategy. \xc2\xa0But in terms of a timetable for any kind of ground operation that would, of course, be led by local opposition forces, that\xe2\x80\x99s just not something that we would discuss publicly in advance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right -- on a timetable. \xc2\xa0And arguably, one of the things that he admitted or said that\xe2\x80\x99s lacking is the ground component to take care of a place like that, to hold territory. \xc2\xa0My colleagues have asked again, is the President -- the Secretary I believe said -- had been on the phone and he talked about -- how engaged is the President in that specific issue of trying to talk to our Sunni Arab partners about getting troops, fighters on the ground in places like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President has had those conversations. \xc2\xa0Those conversations are principally led by Brett McGurk, who is an envoy at the State Department who is principally responsible for discussing with our coalition partners the kind of commitments they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to make to our coalition activities. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that the President has had those kinds of conversations with a variety of world leaders who are leading countries that are part of our coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But at this point, clearly he has not had much success.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce. \xc2\xa0And I think Secretary Carter was pretty blunt that we are concerned about the way that some of our partners in the coalition have been distracted by the ongoing conflict in Yemen, and that continues to be a source of some concern.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you very much, Josh. \xc2\xa0To follow up on both April and Jon\xe2\x80\x99s query, and to put it a little bit into global perspective -- as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a petition in the U.K., which is now reaching 300,000 signers, which will go to Parliament, to the House of Commons, and bring up a debate as to whether or not Donald Trump can be permitted into the United Kingdom. \xc2\xa0This, among other areas of anxiety now reaching fear, have made some of the leaders in Europe actually pretty vocal, and in the Middle East and throughout the global community, as well. \xc2\xa0What would this President say to the global leaders, to the citizenry of the world, to assuage them to belay fears that a Donald Trump presidency, if or not, would not leave America unrecognizable to his allies and to his leaders throughout the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the thing, JC -- to most directly answer your question, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the President\xe2\x80\x99s previous comments that he continues to be confident that he will be succeeded by a Democrat. \xc2\xa0More generally, I think the President has confidence that, regardless of who serves in the Oval Office, that the kinds of values that the President was discussing at the United States Capitol earlier today are enduring. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re enduring because they\xe2\x80\x99re central to the founding of our country but they\xe2\x80\x99re also enduring because they have the broad support of the vast majority of the American people. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to lift up these values and to animate them, to make clear that they are a priority in the policymaking process is, frankly, the reason the President was elected President in the first place. \xc2\xa0And these are values that the President has been fighting for since before he ran for President, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that these are the kinds of values that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to lift up even in the glorious days of his post-presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- I know you and the President and this administration must know that there is real growing concern that this individual who was at this -- to a certain point not so long ago was basically considered a vaudevillian who had great stage presence has now become an entity that may, in fact, influence the future of this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, the President continues to be confident that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be succeeded by a Democrat, and the President continues to be quite outspoken in his view that the offensive, divisive rhetoric of Donald Trump does not at all reflect the values, the heart, the principals and priorities of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:17 P.M.
