Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:15 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I wanted to say something about today\xe2\x80\x99s CBO report, which is welcome news.\xc2\xa0 This report demonstrates the Affordable Care Act is working.\xc2\xa0 It shows that marketplace health care costs have gone down because premium estimates have gone down.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, the effort to constrain health care costs more broadly is showing continued momentum as evidenced by the further reduction in projected Medicare spending.</p>\n<p>The CBO estimates that about 5 million people will enroll in plans that meet the ACA standards outside the marketplace.\xc2\xa0 That is in addition to the millions who have signed up through the marketplaces or gained coverage on Medicaid, or have been able to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans until age 26 because of the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is historic progress and shows how the Affordable Care Act is working as it was supposed to -- by helping more Americans get coverage while making historic progress and slowing health care cost growth and improving our nation\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal outlook by lowering deficits.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I had a couple of questions about the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 A U.S. military official says that a Russian fighter jet made multiple close-range passes near an American warship in the Black Sea.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the U.S. sees that as an attempt by Russia to try to escalate tensions in the region.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the Pentagon has assessed that and called it provocative and unprofessional.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to it.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously very concerned about Russian actions in Ukraine, attempts to destabilize Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the many thousands of troops, Russian troops, that remain on the Ukrainian border.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about provocation actions assisted by or sponsored by Russia that are taking place in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to commend the Ukrainian government in the restraint that they have shown in handling a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has obviously talked multiple times about how Russian incursions into eastern Ukraine would warrant additional sanctions, the sector sanctions, as they\xe2\x80\x99re called.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that the actions that Russia has taken so far in trying to destabilize eastern Ukraine crosses that line and makes it so that he will have to implement sector sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Or does he see that as a response to only basically taking those tens of thousands of forces and actually having them cross the border?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, the United States has been and continues to consult actively with our European partners on the matter of sanctions, and we are doing that even as I speak on these issues -- because as you note, Russia continues to engage in provocative actions in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The mere presence of the troops, in addition to what else they\xe2\x80\x99ve done inside Ukraine, creates a threat of destabilization within Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we will consider next steps in concert with our European partners.</p>\n<p>I would simply note that the authorities the President created by signing the executive orders allow for all kinds of different sanctions, including the ones that you mention.\xc2\xa0 And we have already imposed sanctions under those authorities, and have the capacity because of the executive orders to do more.\xc2\xa0 And we will take action as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess my question is, do the actions that Russia has already taken warrant those tougher sanctions, or have they not crossed that line yet?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say, Julie, is that we are actively evaluating what is happening in eastern Ukraine -- what actions Russia has taken, what transgressions they\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with our partners and assessing for ourselves what response we may choose.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement at this time when it comes to further sanctions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, I guess you can kind of see our confusion here a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to narrow in on whether you feel like they have taken action in eastern Ukraine that does warrant a further U.S. response, or whether they have still stopped short of that kind of action.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re assessing what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done, even as we continue to impose the sanctions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already imposed.\xc2\xa0 And as part of the assessment, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make judgments in coordination with our partners about what further actions to take.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s provocations -- further transgressions and provocations will come with a cost.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to specify what cost will come from which specific action, but there have already been costs imposed on Russia; there will be further costs imposed on Russia.\xc2\xa0 And certainly if they go further down the road of attempting to destabilize Ukraine, rather than choosing the path of deescalation, that the cost will continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, just quickly, there have been some reports in Russian media that John Brennan was in Ukraine over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that he was there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t normally comment on the CIA Director\xe2\x80\x99s travel, but given the extraordinary circumstances in this case and the false claims being leveled by the Russians at the CIA, we can confirm that the Director was in Kyiv this weekend as part of a trip to Europe.\xc2\xa0 Senior-level visits of intelligence officials are a standard means of fostering mutually beneficial security cooperation, including U.S.-Russian intelligence collaboration going back to the beginnings of the post-Cold War era.\xc2\xa0 U.S. and Russian intelligence officials have met over the years -- to imply that U.S. officials meeting with their counterparts is anything other than in the same spirit is absurd.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 With regard to Ukraine, the EU is apparently considering an emergency meeting to discuss sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Would the U.S. participate in that meeting and support such a meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the report that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I can say that we are coordinating very closely with our European partners on this issue, on Ukraine in general, on steps that might be taken in reaction to Russian provocations.\xc2\xa0 But the form that that consultation will take in the future I can\'t say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And among the things that the European Union is considering are a mission to support police and law enforcement in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Would the U.S. support that kind of an intervention?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have, as I think you heard from Secretary Lew this morning, been involved in an effort to actively support the Ukrainian government in this difficult time, to try to help it stabilize its economy as it moves towards May 25th elections.\xc2\xa0 And we are certainly engaged in diplomatic efforts to assist Ukraine as it tries to stabilize a situation in that country, obviously facing a lot of counterproductive acts by Russia as we do that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re doing all of that in coordination with our European allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of possible measures of support that we may engage in with Europe except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very interested in assisting Ukraine as they move forward -- as the Ukrainian government, the Ukrainian people move forward with new elections and efforts to stabilize and improve their economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to step back and ask the broader question -- given further sanctions under consideration, what will the effectiveness of that be since Russia appears not to have stopped the actions that the United States and the European Union object to in eastern Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Russia has to decide what costs it is willing to bear in order to destabilize Ukraine, to maintain the illegal occupation of Crimea, and to engage in the kind of actions that isolate Russia, create a sort of chilling effect globally in terms of the international community\xe2\x80\x99s relationships with Russia.\xc2\xa0 So we can\xe2\x80\x99t make those decisions for them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we and our allies and partners can do is make clear that there are costs for this kind of behavior when you violate a sovereign nation\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, when you engage in clearly provocative efforts to destabilize a sovereign nation.\xc2\xa0 Those actions incur costs, and the United States stands with our European friends in imposing those costs.\xc2\xa0 Those costs will go up the more that Russia pursues this course of action.\xc2\xa0 What I obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t predict to you is how high the costs that Russia is willing to pay are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one question about the CBO report.\xc2\xa0 The CBO report apparently only assigns 6 million people as having signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which would suggest that the 7 million figure that we heard so much about overstates the actual number of people.\xc2\xa0 Do you dispute that 6 million figure?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 CBO uses a technical average-over-the-year estimate in which folks who came in late count for less than somebody who came in early for the purposes of calculating tax credits and so forth.\xc2\xa0 So if you signed up on March 31st, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get insurance until May 1st, you will count essentially as two-thirds of a person in that calculation of what the year averages for people who have signed up.\xc2\xa0 We know for a fact that more than 7.5 million people have signed up through the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously working on teasing apart those figures to provide more information about the makeup of that population of people who signed up.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of CBO\xe2\x80\x99s estimates, this is a technical average-over-the-year number that they compiled that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take into account what I just described to you, which is that if you only have insurance this year because you enrolled for a portion of the year then you don\xe2\x80\x99t count as one whole person in that 6 million figure.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clearly, Russia does not care about the threat of further sanctions, including sector sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I mean, really nothing has changed in their behavior before or after what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there right now.\xc2\xa0 And this administration has talked a lot about sending a message.\xc2\xa0 And when we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at sector sanctions, clearly that would affect Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economy much more than the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s if those were imposed.\xc2\xa0 So would the U.S. act unilaterally in imposing sanctions like that if sending a message is still important?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than sending a message, Michelle, first of all.\xc2\xa0 The actions that we and our partners have taken thus far have come at a cost to Russia.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in terms of how the economic growth figures have been downgraded for Russia.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in terms of the impact on Russian markets.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in terms of the views of international investors as to whether or not they would make the decision to further invest in Russia given the flagrant violation of a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity that Russia has engaged in.</p>\n<p>Now, the kinds of sanctions that the authorities we have allow us to impose would obviously bring higher costs to Russia and to the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 As the President said on the morning that he announced them, the sanctions that affected sectors of the Russian economy would come at a cost to the global economy -- not as severe as the cost that Russia would feel, but certainly the United States and our allies in Europe would feel an impact from those sanctions as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Europeans is that, if necessary, we together would take that kind of action because of the importance of making clear that it is a severe violation of international law to engage in the kind of behavior that Russia has engaged in to violate a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, to engage in the kind of provocative activity that Russia has engaged in, clearly in an attempt to destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine and to provoke a reaction from the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian security forces.</p>\n<p>So obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely and coordinating with our European partners.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that all along.\xc2\xa0 You saw it during the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Europe -- his meetings in Belgium and the Netherlands.\xc2\xa0 And that coordination continues today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we would only act with them --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would never rule out unilateral action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken unilateral action in the sanctions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve imposed already.\xc2\xa0 There is overlap, but not 100 percent overlap with the actions that Europe has taken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems like if sanctions are increased, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to affect Europe so much, especially Britain, with the flow of money between Russia and Britain as one example.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s so little between Russia and the U.S. investment-wise, commerce-wise.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand with the outrageousness of the situation and some of the statements that have been made why the U.S. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do something right now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, surely the administration agrees that what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there is outrageous.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I would point you to the fact that we have acted unilaterally -- but this morning I think, through the Treasury Department, initiated the billion dollars in loan guarantees to Ukraine, which is unilateral assistance.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But we will also continue to closely coordinate with our European partners, precisely because we have spoken in one voice in opposition to what Russia has done in Ukraine, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around.\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the interim Ukrainian President today kind of reversed field and said he was open to the concept of a national referendum added on to the May 25th elections that could create, or at least raise the question of autonomous regions within Ukraine, something that has been an issue pressed by those Russian speakers and ethnic Russians within Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration comfortable with that reversal of field?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian government has for some time now said that it is absolutely interested in having discussions about creating greater autonomy for regions within Russia Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian government has approached this whole challenge in a manner that I think demonstrated professionalism and restraint, and an interest in resolving this crisis in a way that is most beneficial for the Ukrainian people and the nation of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on every point that Ukrainian leaders have made, but I think that they have demonstrated a willingness to try to resolve these issues -- and the suggestion that ethnic Russians in Ukraine are somehow being mistreated or underrepresented -- in a thoughtful and respectful way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It bears remembering that the parliament in Ukraine, the Rada, is the same parliament in Ukraine that existed under the previous President, including with representatives of the party that that President hailed from.\xc2\xa0 And that parliament has been acting responsibly in dealing with these challenges.\xc2\xa0 So it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise that Ukrainian leaders have continued to try to resolve these challenges in a fair and diplomatic way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason I raise that is this administration has pointed to the May 25th elections as a potential turning point or place where Ukraine can form a new government and have a chance to resolve some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 Adding a referendum on the question of creating either autonomous regions or a federated system within the country seems like a not insignificant move and a concession from the interim President toward Russia.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if the administration sees it that way, number one.\xc2\xa0 Number two --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to the remarks that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we commend the Ukrainian government in the manner that it has dealt with a very challenging situation and the manner that it has dealt with a series of provocations, beginning with actions by Russia in Crimea that were viewed by the entire world as illegal, and continuing with the provocative actions that we see on the Ukrainian border and within eastern Ukraine by the Russians and those supported by Russia.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment of that proposal, but I can tell you that we continue to point to the fact that the Ukrainian government has been managing a situation that is very difficult and very challenging in a very responsible manner.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any doubt in this administration\xe2\x80\x99s mind that those types of forces that went into Crimea -- no insignia, advanced weaponry, tactics that looked very organized and cohesive -- is also what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Kharkiv and these other places?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The similarities are striking.\xc2\xa0 The evidence is compelling that Russia is supporting these efforts and involved in these efforts.\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian government has arrested a number of Russian intelligence agents in Ukraine, many of them armed.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that protestors have been paid to take the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0 And, as you note, you saw this coordinated effort in a number of cities across eastern Ukraine all at once that sure didn\xe2\x80\x99t look organic to observers from the outside.</p>\n<p>What I think this tells us is that Russia continues to pursue a course aimed at destabilizing the situation in Ukraine, and that is very concerning to the United States and to our partners and allies.\xc2\xa0 It is for the Ukrainian people to decide for themselves what Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s future looks like, what its relationship with Europe looks like, what its relationship with Russia -- a country with which it has long and important cultural and historical and economic ties -- looks like.\xc2\xa0 But only for the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 It is not something that another nation from the outside can dictate or should dictate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just picking up on Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question -- last one -- you just said it:\xc2\xa0 Russia continues to destabilize the situation, act in a provocative way, now buzzing a U.S. warship.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a sense in the administration and in the European capitals with which you are collaboratively dealing with that what is going on is not working?\xc2\xa0 That whatever signals you\xe2\x80\x99re sending, they\xe2\x80\x99re either not being heeded or misread; and this entire approach, which is to not escalate, isn\xe2\x80\x99t working and everything the Russians are doing is continuing to escalate the situation, overriding what they may see and some editorial critics have regarded as passivity by the West?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, Major, because the premise of the question is based on the notion that all the United States ever has to do when something happens in the world that we don\xe2\x80\x99t like is say stop it and they\xe2\x80\x99ll stop.\xc2\xa0 We are taking concerted action with our allies and partners that is imposing costs on Russia for what Russia has done, making clear that much more significant costs will be imposed on Russia should they continue down this path.\xc2\xa0 And it is a simple fact that in the world that we live in today and the interconnected global economy that every nation, including Russia, participates in, that the impact of those costs on Russia, if we have to impose them, will be severe.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly bad for Russia, for the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the Russian people.\xc2\xa0 And it only serves to further isolate Russia at a time when so much of the world is moving forward economically and democratically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what we can do -- again, going back to my answer before in terms of assessing how far Russia is willing to go and what Russia\xe2\x80\x99s motivations are -- what we can do is make clear that the kind of violations of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Russia are not acceptable; make clear that there are costs that will come as a result of that; and to increase those costs appropriately as Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions dictate.</p>\n<p>Yes, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For those Americans who are not paying -- who have not been paying detailed attention to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the faraway border of Ukraine and Russia, today\xe2\x80\x99s provocation of an American ship may have perked up their ears.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether or not you could right now tell us what the status is of U.S.-Russia relationship.\xc2\xa0 Are we in a Cold War again?\xc2\xa0 Is war inevitable along the Ukrainian border?\xc2\xa0 Is America being drawn into another conflict with Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start at the top.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not in a Cold War because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember what the dynamics of the Cold War were.\xc2\xa0 They were -- you had two super powers, you had two economic blocs, you had two military blocs.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t two of any of those things today.\xc2\xa0 Russia is not the Soviet Union; there is no Warsaw Pact.\xc2\xa0 There is no Soviet economic bloc.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the United States is working with partners and allies from around the world and especially in Europe -- including partners and allies that are nations that used to fall within the Soviet bloc -- in pursuit of the simple proposition that a nation\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty have to be respected and should not be violated; and that should violations occur, should a nation\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty be violated, then there have be actions and responses and costs incurred.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the United States do, working with our partners and allies.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the current relationship that we have with Russia has been strained by the actions, provocative behavior of Russia in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 But we as an administration and as a country pursue a relationship with Russia that\xe2\x80\x99s very clear-eyed, which is, as I\xe2\x80\x99m doing today and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for some time now -- makes clear when we have profound disagreements with what Russia is doing, and if necessary that we impose costs working with our partners and allies in response to what Russia is doing, but continues to work with Russia when it is in our interest to do so and in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest -- for example, in the P5-plus-1 negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are.</p>\n<p>The question about is military conflict inevitable between Russia and Ukraine, the answer is no.\xc2\xa0 Russia has the opportunity to deescalate rather than escalate.\xc2\xa0 And we have in our conversations with Russian government officials and in coordination with the Ukrainian government and our European allies made clear that that path is available to Russia, and it includes pulling back its forces from the border.\xc2\xa0 It includes engaging in a dialogue with the Ukrainian government, with international partners.\xc2\xa0 And it includes taking steps in general that help deescalate the situation rather than create more of a crisis atmosphere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we have worked with Russia in making clear to Russia that that avenue is available to it, and we continue to press that case even as we work with our partners and allies to respond to provocations as they occur.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Americans have -- certainly in the last decade, dismissed Russia as a threat, certainly as a threat that it was in the \xe2\x80\x9860s and \xe2\x80\x9870s and \xe2\x80\x9880s.\xc2\xa0 Is Russia a threat again?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Russia is clearly a threat to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Russia -- as I think the President mentioned not that long ago -- is a regional power, to be sure.\xc2\xa0 And Russia has the capacity, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent weeks, to take action that causes a great deal of concern across the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a threat to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is, we have profound differences with Russia, and we confront those differences directly and address them directly.\xc2\xa0 The best course of action for Russia is to deescalate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the best course of action for Europe and for the world, and the United States, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re pressing Russia to do.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I presume you\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to President Hollande today.\xc2\xa0 And does he agree with President Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s call for graduated sanctions against Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t read out a call that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet, as I understand, or that we\xe2\x80\x99re not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The French said it happened.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so it has happened.\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President spoke with President Hollande.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a full readout for you, but I think it demonstrates the fact that we have been consulting regularly with our allies and partners on Ukraine and other issues.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with Chancellor Merkel last week, President Hollande today.\xc2\xa0 We continue those conversations not just with our allies and partners but with Russia, as well importantly as well as with Ukraine.</p>\n<p>But in terms of what course of action we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take when it comes to sanctions, we\xe2\x80\x99re working that through with our partners and internally as we assess what Russia is doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the Ukrainian interim President\xe2\x80\x99s call for U.N. peacekeepers?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t evaluate every proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s being put on the table, except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look at the actions that we should be taking.\xc2\xa0 We have endorsed as a general principle the presence of international observers from the U.N. and the OSCE in Ukraine -- observers who can assess whether or not Russia\xe2\x80\x99s complaints about the treatment of ethnic Russians in Ukraine have any merit.\xc2\xa0 There is no evidence that they have merit, but we are perfectly willing and -- in fact, to accept and in fact endorse a proposal that would place international observers in Ukraine to make that assessment independently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you reject the Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Ukraine as being not nearly enough, not strong enough?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, what I can say is that we have been very forceful in making clear that there are costs associated with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 We have imposed costs already that have had an impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 We have created authorities that allow additional costs to be imposed that could have a much greater impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And we have worked very closely with our international allies and partners to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking with one voice on this matter and that we\xe2\x80\x99re all taking action to impose costs on Russia for its behavior.\xc2\xa0 I think that is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed Russia\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That, again, goes back to the suggestion -- and perhaps critics have the magic words that allow for the United States to simply say don\xe2\x80\x99t do this or impose an action and then suddenly it stops happening.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, in a conflict like this, in a crisis like this, it is incumbent upon the United States to lead, and we have done that and we have coordinated closely with Europe appropriately given the location of this crisis in order to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re together imposing costs on Russia.\xc2\xa0 And I think that has made clear to Russia that its actions only further isolate Moscow from the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, given the coordinated effort that you referred to taking place and your acknowledgement that just because we say something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything necessarily happens, what can the U.S. point to right now that demonstrates that it is succeeding as a deterrent from further incursions or invasions of the sort that are happening right now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I continue to make clear that the United States has imposed sanctions.\xc2\xa0 The United States has authorities --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does that served as a deterrent?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s like saying that the arms buildup wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a deterrent for 50 years until -- or 40 years -- until the Soviet Union collapsed.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- again, stretching the Cold War analogy here -- but the fact of the matter is, when Russia behaves this way, we have made clear that it cannot do so without incurring a cost.\xc2\xa0 And we have imposed costs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, through the authorities that have been created under the executive orders the President signed, that we are willing to escalate those costs significantly as necessary in response to further action by Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen damage to the Russian economy already because of the actions that we and others have taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think no one doubts that should further costs be imposed there will be further significant damage done to the Russian economy and further isolation of Russia within the international community.\xc2\xa0 Those are concrete costs, and we are going to make clear that the kind of conduct that Russia has engaged in, the kind of crude propaganda that they have promulgated that flies in the face of all the facts that we know about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground, only serve to isolate Russia further and make clear the necessity of imposing costs because of Russian activity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a better sense of the President\xe2\x80\x99s position in terms of the provision of nonlethal supplies or small arms to those in Ukraine that are trying to fight off this incursion?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that we are looking at a variety of ways to demonstrate our strong support for Ukraine, including diplomatically and economically.\xc2\xa0 With regard to any potential military assistance to Ukraine, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 But our main focus continues to be on supporting economic and diplomatic efforts to deescalate the situation.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said, we do not see a military solution to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not actively considering lethal aid, but we are reviewing the kinds of assistance that we can provide and have already provided, as you know, or taken action to provide economic assistance to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then also on the CBO numbers, very briefly, I know you touted those at the beginning of today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 Only a couple months ago, the top economist, Jason Furman, in the same room disputed CBO numbers that raising the federal minimum wage to I think $10.10, he said, would in fact cost up to 500,000 jobs implemented in the second half of 2016.\xc2\xa0 So critics will accuse the White House of cherry-picking the CBO\xe2\x80\x99s figures on days like today saying, look, the CBO, this is the arbiter of all things good and it\xe2\x80\x99s on our side, and on other days it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 So which way is it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What Jason said at the time is that on the specific issue that was considered when it came to the minimum wage, the authorities on that subject were not resident at the CBO.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of outside economic analysis that we could point to where experts in the field have come to a different judgment.</p>\n<p>On this issue, the CBO has obviously expended a great deal of energy and expertise on evaluating an actual implemented policy, the Affordable Care Act, in combination with the evaluations it does on the state of our economy and on our deficits and debt.\xc2\xa0 There was another report today that I think you probably saw but I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be asked about, which is that shows that our deficit is falling even faster than CBO predicted in February.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so these are things that CBO is quite skilled at analyzing.\xc2\xa0 But on that specific instance, I would point you to the very full explanation for why we did not view that report in the same way the CBO did.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the administration gone any further in establishing whether Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces used chemical weapons in this latest attack?\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s proven to be so, and it is in fact chlorine gas -- which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t under the previous deal -- would you still see that as an infringement of the deal to get rid of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about that, because we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the reports and the specific report that you mention, and we\xe2\x80\x99re looking into them but we have not been able to corroborate those claims at this time.\xc2\xa0 I would note that the OPCW-U.N. Joint Mission\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation of the removal of 65 percent of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s declared chemical weapons was just made.\xc2\xa0 And Syria remains behind the schedule agreed to by the OPCW Executive Council, and we continue to press the Syrian regime to transfer these chemicals to Latakia for removal by April 27th.\xc2\xa0 They have the ability to do so; now they need to meet their obligation by expediting removals to meet the June 30th destruction deadline.\xc2\xa0 But I think that it is important to note, nevertheless, that OPCW-U.N. has confirmed the removal of 65 percent of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s declared chemicals.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve commended the Ukrainian government a couple of times on their restraint, and I wonder if the administration supports their deployment of counterterrorism forces to the east and the ultimatum they\xe2\x80\x99ve given.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, in terms of the actual actions that the Ukrainian government has taken, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated again and again -- both in the restraint they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown and in the offers they\xe2\x80\x99ve made, including amnesty and a commitment to resolve these situations peacefully -- that that is their absolute preferred course of action.</p>\n<p>All I would say on the other matter is the idea that you hear from Russia that somehow Ukraine, a sovereign state, should not be able to respond to potential threats posed within its borders is novel given where Russian has been in the past on that issue.</p>\n<p>So what I can tell you is on actions by the Ukrainian government and the multiple offers they\xe2\x80\x99ve made to try to resolve these situations peacefully, I think speak to the restraint that the Ukrainian government has shown.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that there is no military solution to this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is what consistent?\xc2\xa0 The fact --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The deployment of troops to eastern Ukraine.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no military, in our view, solution to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 But again, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a situation internally and in cities in a region of the nation.\xc2\xa0 What I can again reiterate is that again and again the Ukrainian government has demonstrated its willingness to try to resolve these issues peacefully; has made clear their willingness to look at reforming -- going back to Major\xe2\x80\x99s question -- reforming their constitution and other laws that have to do with the relative autonomy that certain regions might have from the center.</p>\n<p>This is a government that, contrary to the propaganda you see coming out of Moscow, was put in a place by a parliament that preexisted the point after which President Yanukovych fled the country.\xc2\xa0 And it consists of members of his own party that now support what the current government has been doing and the way it\xe2\x80\x99s been handling this situation.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to flyspeck every action or decision made.\xc2\xa0 But overall, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s incontestable that the Ukrainian government has tried to resolve this in a peaceful, diplomatic way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans to speak with President Putin any time soon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you can expect that the President will speak with President Putin again very soon, perhaps today.\xc2\xa0 But if and when that happens, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, getting back to sort of trying to change the dynamic of the last six weeks or so, this kind of call-and-response dynamic that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place -- the President says don\xe2\x80\x99t go into Crimea, Russia goes into Crimea; impose sanctions, they annex Crimea.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the downside of flipping that a bit and imposing sanctions before Russia takes the next step rolling troops over the border formally --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s strains credulity to suggest that Russia went into Crimea because the West said don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a fair representation of what the motives are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, the difficulty of trying to unravel something that\xe2\x80\x99s already happened through sanctions has not seemed to work with Russia yet, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s an argument taking place inside the administration on, well, before that happens, before these troops may come over the border on this pretext, let\xe2\x80\x99s show them the pain ahead of time rather than threaten the pain afterwards.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we are involved in assessing what Russia has been doing, what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing now, what its possible next actions might be.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that in the context of what costs we might impose -- we collectively might impose on Russia for the actions they undertake.\xc2\xa0 And the kinds of permutations of that conversation are many, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out sort of a way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at them as a possibility under consideration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I would say that there have been costs imposed, and any doubt about that can be refuted by the fact that $70 billion of capital flight took place out of Russia in the first quarter.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, demonstrates basically a vote of no confidence, by those who have capital in Russia, in the actions that Russia is taking and the fact that those actions have resulted in costs being imposed on the Russian economy and individuals and entities, and that more costs are coming if Russia continues to act in this way.</p>\n<p>Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip on April 22nd -- what does he hope to accomplish and what does he hope to take away from his visit to the Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview it too far in advance except to say that it demonstrates this administration\xe2\x80\x99s and this country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of the support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown already in the economic package that has moved forward, and the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with the IMF to make sure that further economic assistance is available to Ukraine, and all the diplomatic efforts that are underway to try to deescalate the situation between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say as the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip comes closer, but I think it reflects the commitment that we have made to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, the democratic aspirations of Ukraine -- the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions on different subjects.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s potential call to President Putin today -- because of the range of conversations they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past, can you clarify does the President have a continuation of the warnings that he\xe2\x80\x99s been issuing, or does he have something to advise him about in the way of additional sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Once the call is completed we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout for you, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more for you on it now.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have been communicating at multiple levels with the Russian government, extensively through the Foreign Minister channel -- the Secretary of State with Foreign Minister Lavrov -- and at the presidential level.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has had a number of conversations during this crisis with President Putin, making clear both our strenuous objection to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s violations of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and our fundamental belief that Russia has an opportunity to avail itself of a path of deescalation and that we would work with the international community and Russia and the Ukrainian government in seeing that path pursued.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been and that\xe2\x80\x99s been the nature of the conversations that the President has had with President Putin, and that Secretary Kerry has had with Foreign Minister Lavrov, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that that is the frame in which further conversations will take place.\xc2\xa0 But once appropriate we will have a readout of the call.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Change of subject -- on the Affordable Care Act and Sylvia Burwell\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming confirmation hearing.\xc2\xa0 Is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s hope that HHS will have unpacked all of the enrollment numbers and the demographic breakdowns before Congress would be questioning his new nominee for that position?\xc2\xa0 Or would those numbers come out after the confirmation hearings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that HHS and CMS are working to crunch the numbers and assess the data, and to collect it in a way that provides as much information as possible along the lines that you mentioned, including the demographic breakdown.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for when that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 I think it is separate from the timetable for the consideration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the position of Secretary of HHS.\xc2\xa0 But you can expect that HHS and CMS are acting with all due deliberation to make sure that they can collect as much data as possible to provide it to the public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But in answer to your question, I have no doubt that no matter what we provide there will be assertions or questions about how we haven\xe2\x80\x99t provided enough.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that President Obama is going to call President Putin today.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been I think a little over a week, maybe two weeks since the public has heard from President Obama about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And given all the uncertainty about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the border of Ukraine and eastern Ukraine, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t we heard from him on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President was recently on a foreign trip where he took a lot of questions about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s I\xe2\x80\x99m sure going to speak about Ukraine in the coming days and weeks, especially in encounters with the press if reporters ask him about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other scheduling announcements to make in terms of when the President will be speaking on this issue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt, if you look back at how many times the President has discussed this in the past weeks, that this has been a priority subject here in the White House in the national security arena, and that the President is very directly engaged in it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you hint there that there is going to be a chance for us to ask him about this coming up soon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I just mean in general.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes when the press gets a chance to ask about a variety of subjects they don\xe2\x80\x99t always ask about the ones that you might think they would. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. will withdraw American troops in Afghanistan unless BSA is signed.\xc2\xa0 On the contrary, Russian influence has slowly, but constantly increasing in Central Asia as a result of Customs Union and other (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 Do you think the U.S. is losing in the region?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is losing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Losing in the region influence and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In terms of Afghanistan and the troop --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Central Asia.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously have bilateral relationships with -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the former Soviet republics and now independent nations of Central Asia, we have bilateral relationships with all of them.\xc2\xa0 Some of them involve extensive cooperation and relatively deep ties.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I understand the question as related to U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>We have a policy with regards to Afghanistan that I think is very focused on the mission that sent U.S. troops to Afghanistan -- the President refocused our attention on upon review of our Afghan policy.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to pursue that policy, and that includes drawing down forces this year.\xc2\xa0 It also includes the possibility of a troop presence beyond 2014 if, and only if, a bilateral security agreement is signed by Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So there are some ifs in there, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what happens in the coming months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the broad sector sanctions that the President has signed the EO for and agreed with the G7 partners for, is there a trigger by which those sanctions -- a threshold by which those sanctions would be triggered?\xc2\xa0 Are you intentionally leaving it ambiguous?\xc2\xa0 And if you are leaving it ambiguous, I mean, would it, for example, be triggered if Russian troops pour over the border with Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 And if you are leaving it ambiguous, then how can you be sure the G7 is going to follow through with the commitments that you reached in The Hague?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mike, what I can say and said at the top of the briefing is that we are in regular consultations with our European partners about assessing further costs on Russia for the actions Russia has taken in Ukraine, and those conversations and assessments continue.\xc2\xa0 What is clear is that what Russia has already done in Crimea and Ukraine has led to costs being imposed on it.\xc2\xa0 We have authorities to impose further costs, and are evaluating our options and working with our partners in terms of next steps.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to consult, that leaves the impression or the implication that there is no hard threshold, no hard trigger to impose those sanctions.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is that there have been costs; the effect of those costs have been clear.\xc2\xa0 There will be more costs if Russia continues down this path, and they will be more severe.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to attach this sanction in response to this action not least because Russia could then do a whole bunch of other things except for that specific action.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s now how this works.</p>\n<p>We are working very closely with our European partners and allies.\xc2\xa0 We ourselves internally are assessing the powers that we have and the actions that we could take, which could include more sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a variety of options available, even within the realm of sanctions.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue in those deliberations and obviously let you know if and when we\xe2\x80\x99re making -- or taking further action.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on what you said about organic -- the eastern Ukraine uprisings not looking organic from the outside.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration completely ruled out the possibility that the Ukrainians could have organized those uprisings in eastern Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is such overwhelming evidence to suggest otherwise, including evidence that suggests that some of the organizers weren\xe2\x80\x99t locals, weren\xe2\x80\x99t even from the places that they were protesting; evidence that members were paid.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not often that you suddenly have in a variety of cities all at the same time a bunch of men wearing military gear without insignias, including bullet-proof vests, suddenly sprout up organically in the form of protests.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a heavy-handed approach, but an approach that Russia has familiarity with, having taken it in the past, including in the Soviet past.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not fooling anybody.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not fooling even that many people within Russia who are subjected to the controlled media in Russia where this kind of stuff is promulgated most broadly.</p>\n<p>To the contrary, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a general lack of support for or interest in the activities of protesters, even within the cities and regions of eastern Ukraine, where it\xe2\x80\x99s taken place.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen rejection -- official rejection from local governmental bodies of the assertions of independence or autonomy that some of these alleged organic protest groups have made.\xc2\xa0 And I have a little experience with this, and you know it when you see it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just not on the level.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Kansas shootings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President speak about the terrible shooting in Kansas.\xc2\xa0 He issued a statement yesterday and spoke about it this morning, and our thoughts and prayers go out the families and friends who\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a loved one and everyone affected by yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s shooting in Overland Park, Kansas.</p>\n<p>The President has asked his team to stay in close touch with our federal, state, and local partners and to provide the necessary resources to support the ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 While we do not know all of the details surrounding the shooting, the initial reports are heartbreaking.\xc2\xa0 As you saw yesterday, the President offered his condolences to all of the families trying to make sense of this difficult situation.\xc2\xa0 And he pledged the full support from the federal government as we heal and cope during this trying time.</p>\n<p>I think you saw statements from the Department of Justice about how they are viewing this crime and investigating it, but for more details on that, I would refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, now that they\xe2\x80\x99ve said it is a hate crime, as have --</p>\n<p>MR.
