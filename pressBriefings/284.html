EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One this afternoon en route to Beaverton.\xc2\xa0 I just have one announcement at the top that\xe2\x80\x99s personnel related.</p>\n<p>This trip is the last trip for Hannah Hankins, a wrangler who you all know has moved on to be the Communications Director for the Domestic Policy Council.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s doing an exemplary job.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s come back around for this trip.\xc2\xa0 But I just wanted to point that out on the record.</p>\n<p>The second personnel announcement I have is this is also the last trip for Assistant Press Secretary Jessica Santillo, who handles the health care and education and veterans affairs portfolio for us.\xc2\xa0 She, too, has done extraordinary work on behalf of the President and the administration for many years now.\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s joining us on this trip, and we appreciate her and wish her good luck in the private sector where she goes next.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s next move on NSA?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, we are in the process of evaluating the decision handed down earlier today by the courts.\xc2\xa0 Without commenting specifically on that ruling today, I will say the President has been clear that he believes we should end the 215 bulk telephony metadata program as it currently exists by creating an alternative mechanism to preserve the program\xe2\x80\x99s essential capabilities without the government holding the bulk data.</p>\n<p>We continue to work closely with members of Congress from both parties to do just that.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been encouraged by the good progress on the bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would implement these important reforms known as the USA Freedom Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the reforms that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at will address the issues that the court raised?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I know that the leaders of that bill put out a statement to that effect.\xc2\xa0 Our team is still reviewing the details of the ruling.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that regardless of the fine print of that ruling, that legislation is the way to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the ruling a setback?\xc2\xa0 Is that something you guys were expecting?\xc2\xa0 Or you\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to prevail?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would say, Jim, that our views on this -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on this far predates today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that because of privacy concerns, that the way this program is run right now should no longer be continued.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we support the USA Freedom Act, which, as you know, is supported by Republicans and Democrats alike in Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the ruling buttresses the President\xe2\x80\x99s position in a way?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think our lawyers are reviewing the fine print in the ruling and the legal rationale that\xe2\x80\x99s included in there by the judge.\xc2\xa0 But our view is the privacy concerns that the President stated, I believe last year now, are ones that should prompt the United States Congress to take action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re flying to Oregon.\xc2\xa0 The President has got this event tomorrow at Nike.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any regrets about choosing Nike as the place to make this statement about TPP and fast-track, given the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to land at a fundraiser, be thronged by protestors?\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s now sort of on the defense when you want to be on the offense.\xc2\xa0 Or is he going to pull a rabbit out of a hat with some spectacular announcement of the environment and labor tomorrow that will change all the critics\xe2\x80\x99 minds?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, we\xe2\x80\x99re either on defense or we\xe2\x80\x99re spectacular.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Let me try and characterize it the way we see it, which is the President is looking forward to this visit for an important reason.\xc2\xa0 We believe that securing a trade deal will be good for American workers and good for the American workforce.</p>\n<p>I will let Nike share with you the impact they anticipate a trade deal having on their company.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that it is safe for you all to assume that the President would not be going to one of America\xe2\x80\x99s top companies if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t a testament to how this trade deal would positively impact America\xe2\x80\x99s workforce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we assume, Eric, that Nike is going to be making some kind of announcement about manufacturing to be timed with this visit?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Nike share their news when they\xe2\x80\x99re available to do so.\xc2\xa0 I will say it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be also important to note that while the President is in Beaverton, at Nike, he\xe2\x80\x99s also going to be joined by representatives from a multitude of small businesses in the area who also would benefit from a trade deal because of their heavy reliance on exports that helps them grow jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s event is going to be -- it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously as Nike.\xc2\xa0 That will be a focus.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re also going to look at the broader impact across the United States workforce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Nike does have news to share?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- if they do, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will be on their list to be told.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, how much has the White House told Nike about what\xe2\x80\x99s in the trade deal with Asia, in TPP?\xc2\xa0 I mean, presumably, whether they make an announcement tomorrow, it will be based on whether this deal passes.\xc2\xa0 So how much do they know about the deal ahead of time?\xc2\xa0 Have you shared any details with them that we might not have heard already?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, that\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have private conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I think that obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with Nike to set up this event.\xc2\xa0 I also know that Nike is not alone in recognizing the economic benefits of what a trade deal would mean to American workers and American jobs.</p>\n<p>As you know, 95 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s customers are outside our borders, so it\xe2\x80\x99s important for U.S. companies to be able to sell to those markets.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nike has about a million workers working in contract factories overseas, and the country that has the most is Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 Vietnam, even by the U.S. acknowledgement, has not met international standards on labor in many respects.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s message then going in?\xc2\xa0 And is Nike going to accept having to pay, perhaps, or meet higher labor standards in one of its main contract factories -- locations?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s message going in will be very similar to what you\'ve heard for the preceding weeks, which is the trade deal that the President hopes to sign is one that is not only good for American workers, good for the American economy, but is one that includes the strongest, oldest human rights protections, labor protections, and environmental protections we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in a trade deal.\xc2\xa0 We are fully aware that past trade deals have not always lived up to the hype.</p>\n<p>And that is why the President doubled down on his efforts and instructed his negotiating team to really make sure that the labor, environmental, and human rights protections were not just included in maybe a side letter or a side deal that was associated with the trade deal, but written into the text of the deal in a fully enforceable way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this Nike choice, there are a lot of small businesses in Oregon that do export and would love to export more.\xc2\xa0 Why not just pick -- why not have picked one of those and avoid all these questions about Nike?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 First, I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to avoid any questions about Nike.\xc2\xa0 We appreciate the high anticipation for this event.\xc2\xa0 But your second -- your larger point is a good one, and I would expect a lot of participation tomorrow from those small businesses that do rely on exports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about -- not to get super in the weeds -- but your whip count, Democrats on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 I mean, many of the Democrats who you need to win over in the House have been leaning in the opposite direction in the walkup to this Nike event.\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to change hearts and minds?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a fair question, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to offer you a whip count, as much fun as that would be right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would tell you that the President has been deeply engaged in this, as have members from across the administration.\xc2\xa0 That includes senior folks at the White House; that includes several Cabinet secretaries.\xc2\xa0 And that outreach includes both private briefings and conversations, meetings.\xc2\xa0 But the pitch we make in those private sessions is very similar to the one that the President makes publicly, which is globalization is at our door, and we have two options as the United States:\xc2\xa0 We can put our head in the sand and pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s non-existent, or we can make sure that we are the ones leveling the playing field for America\xe2\x80\x99s workers.</p>\n<p>The President believes if we\xe2\x80\x99re not out there setting the terrain, that the Chinese will.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that if the Chinese set the rules, they will do so in a way that advantages their companies.\xc2\xa0 The United States believes that\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong direction to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, on a separate issue, do you have any information about this drone strike that apparently killed an AQAP member?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on these reports.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to our counterterrorism strategy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously, which is we continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from Yemen, and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we have capabilities postured in the area to address them.</p>\n<p>As we have in the past, we will continue to take action to disrupt continuing imminent threats to the United States and our citizens.\xc2\xa0 That remains the policy of this administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The woman who sponsored the Mohammed cartoon thing in Texas made an issue last night that neither the FBI nor the U.S. government is doing anything to protect her or talking to her.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a direct response.\xc2\xa0 I would say that I think this incident at-large does underscore how closely coordinated our law enforcement agencies have been, both at the local level, the state level, and the national level.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them if you have questions about their level of engagement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the decision in Canada this morning, a judge said that Omar Khadr, the former Guantanamo Bay detainee, could be released on bail.\xc2\xa0 I know that you were asked about the potential for that earlier this week, but now that it\xe2\x80\x99s happened, do you have any response to that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit I did not see that before getting on this flight.\xc2\xa0 I think, as Josh stated at that time, our general view is that the detention center at Guantanamo Bay is counter to America\xe2\x80\x99s values.\xc2\xa0 It is a recruiting tool for those -- for our enemies, and it should be closed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Part of that closure is going to mean -- when these prisoners are sent to other countries -- making sure that that is done, A, with the unanimous consent of our national security team, and, B, in close coordination with those other countries.\xc2\xa0 And I know that every time that that happens there are mitigation steps taking place.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details of those for this particular instance for you, but I know that that was true in this case, as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu has formed a government.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any scheduling updates about a possible meeting with the President going forward or any other comments about that formation?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that the United States does congratulate the Israeli people, the Prime Minister, and the new governing coalition on the formation of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s new government.\xc2\xa0 The President does look forward to working with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his new government.\xc2\xa0 And as the President has emphasized, the United States places great importance on our close military, intelligence and security cooperation with Israel, which reflects the deep and abiding partnership between both countries.</p>\n<p>But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any events or scheduling updates for you at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reaction to the Senate vote on Iran, the Iran nuclear?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I saw the Senate did approve that bill that had been previously approved in a bipartisan way through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a bill, as you know, the President said he would sign.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bill that we thought represented a compromise when it came together.\xc2\xa0 Now it has to pass the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 But the President said he would sign it in its current form.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has also made clear that if amendments were added to that bill that would endanger a deal coming together that prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, that we\xe2\x80\x99d oppose it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the elections in Britain -- exit polls are due out in 50 minutes or so.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be keeping an eye on those from the plane?\xc2\xa0 Will he be briefed on that on the road?\xc2\xa0 Or is he waiting until a government can be formed before he really gets involved?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I know that we are monitoring those elections clearly.\xc2\xa0 We have a special relationship with the people of Great Britain and their government.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details of how the President is being kept up to date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President rooting for Jim Messina or David Axelrod?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 My boss, Josh Earnest, has gone to great lengths to avoid being seen as weighing in on the scales of that election, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do the same.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about his two friends.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have a special BBC feed on the plane in front today?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to share what\xe2\x80\x99s on the television up front.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The exit polls will appear on CNN.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the plug, Kevin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about what\xe2\x80\x99s on the plane or who\xe2\x80\x99s on the plane, do you have any update you can give us now about who\xe2\x80\x99s traveling with the President?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, there are no current members of Congress on the plane with us, but Congresswoman Bonamici will be meeting us at the tarmac and Congressman Blumenauer will be meeting us at the tarmac; so will the governor and the mayor of Portland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just the --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The governor and the mayor of Portland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be any members at the event tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, both of those members will be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why did Senator Wyden not participate?\xc2\xa0 I assume he was invited.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he was invited.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check with his office for his schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Depending on how tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s timing works we might as well ask you today:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the President is going to be visiting his 50th state as President, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you can tell us any more today about how he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling about that -- whether he said anything about that as he was getting ready to come here today, and how he feels about the state of Democratic politics in South Dakota.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, I don\'t have an electoral analysis of that state to provide for you right now.\xc2\xa0 But I do think the President is very much looking forward to both our stop tonight and tomorrow morning, and then his stop in South Dakota.</p>\n<p>As you point out, it is the 50th state that the President has visited while President.\xc2\xa0 He was there in 2008, as I think you recall.\xc2\xa0 I was not.\xc2\xa0 I was helping elect Al Franken into the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s visit will be momentous for a couple of different reasons.\xc2\xa0 And first amongst those is that at Lake Area Technical College, the President is going to underscore the importance of making community college available to all responsible students as part of his America\xe2\x80\x99s College Promise campaign, one of several major proposals that builds on the historic investment the President has made in college affordability and quality.</p>\n<p>I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say on this tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But LATC is a flagship community college which has done extraordinary work making sure young people are prepared for the 21st century economy, making sure they have the skills they need.\xc2\xa0 And the President is proud to support their work by showing up there in person tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can I ask -- as far as I can tell, the President only landed in Nebraska to immediately drive to Iowa.\xc2\xa0 Is this really the 50th state he\xe2\x80\x99s visited?\xc2\xa0 And will he give Nebraska a little bit more attention in the last -- for this fourth quarter?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I don\'t have any further travel to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nebraska is not getting shortchanged here?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That would not be my read.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Alaska have been -- those have just been landings, right, and refueling stops?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but I think he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken to the troops.\xc2\xa0 I would urge you -- if this is on your mind -- Pete Souza just did a remarkable post on Medium that shares 49 photos from 49 different states, including Nebraska.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s really remarkable to take a look.\xc2\xa0 And he also wrote personally how difficult it was to choose one picture from each state.\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to update the post to be 50.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the British elections.\xc2\xa0 We know what the President\xe2\x80\x99s relationship is, of course, with David Cameron.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what, if any, relationship -- does he know Ed Miliband?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s been their knowledge of each other?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That is a good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the details on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look into it for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 On the trade bill, what are his plans for next week in terms of -- because I believe the Senate is supposed to have at least one vote on it.\xc2\xa0 What will he do, and what is he planning to do to try to get the dozen Democrats or so that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to need?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think you can expect the President to continue the engagement we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen for the past couple of weeks and maybe even months now, and that is both publicly making the case why this makes sense for America\xe2\x80\x99s workforce and American jobs, but also working directly and privately with members of Congress to answer their questions and make sure they have all the information they need to make a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how many he has spoken with privately, just generally?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a tally to read out to you at this time, but I can tell you the President has had a robust number of conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t4:15 P.M.
