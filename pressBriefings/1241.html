GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You heard from the President today -- make the case why we need to get this done, and most importantly, why we need to get this done for our economy.\xc2\xa0 So I know some of you have had an opportunity, maybe on this agreement and certainly on other things, to talk with Director Summers.\xc2\xa0 We wanted him to come down today and talk you guys through and answer your questions on anything that relates to the most important part of the deal, and that\'s the economic substance of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I\'m going to turn this over to Larry, who will say a few words, and then the three of us will take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis deal is a compromise.\xc2\xa0 That means it\xe2\x80\x99s got things we like; that means it\xe2\x80\x99s got things we don\'t like.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to extend the high-income tax cuts for one day beyond January 1st.\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to return to 2009 estate tax parameters rather than make a substantial financial commitment to 6,000 families, each of whom would benefit by more than a million dollars.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an imperfect agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt does, however, change in a very important way the economic picture as most observers would have judged it even two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why essentially all the major economic forecasting firms are in the process of rerunning their models and revising upwards their estimates of GDP in the 1 percent range and their estimates of job creation over the next year-plus in the range of 1 million or more jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat is because this bill does five fundamentally important things.\xc2\xa0 First, it ends the uncertainty regarding the middle-class tax cuts, which, if not extended past January 1st, would have led to sharply reduced payroll taxes, $2,000 increases in tax burdens for average families.\xc2\xa0 That uncertainty is removed.\xc2\xa0 That risk to the outlook is removed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSecond, it fully extends unemployment insurance benefits for 99 weeks and tweaks the benefit formula in a way that slightly increases eligibility for extended benefits for 13 months, beginning as of December 1st, at a cost of $60 billion.\xc2\xa0 That is the program that the Congressional Budget Office has identified as the single most potent stimulus in providing for job creation simply because the propensity to spend is highest for those unemployed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThird, it extends the -- it provides for a roughly 2 percent payroll tax holiday, at a cost of $100-$120 billion.\xc2\xa0 Not only does this -- this represents essentially a doubling of the support for middle-class families that the Make Work Pay program that has been in place for the last two years provided.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFourth, key refundable tax cuts contained in the Recovery Act are continued.\xc2\xa0 The Earned Income Tax Credit for those with a third child, the American Opportunity Tax Credit to support access to college education, and the child tax credit for all families with incomes above even $3,000 -- all of that is continued for the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI might just note that the benefit to those constituencies from the extension of those three tax cuts -- just those last three refundables that I mentioned -- is twice as great per year as the cost of the estate tax provisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFinally, the bill adopts the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal from September of 100 percent business expensing next year and 50 percent business expensing in 2012.\xc2\xa0 That means the total cost of an investment in equipment, in new factory, can be written off in the year that it has made.\xc2\xa0 That will, over the next two years, put an additional $180 billion into the economy, the vast majority of which will be recouped over the subsequent years, because if you take your depreciation allowance this year it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer available to you in subsequent years, resulting in about a $20 billion improvement in the 2015 budget deficit picture.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThese five measures taken together are, as I indicated, leading to significant revisions in the economic outlook.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, job creation and growth are enormously valuable in and of themselves.\xc2\xa0 They are also crucial to reducing the deficit over the medium to long run, to reducing poverty over the medium to long run, and to enabling the nation to afford all of its other objectives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe believe that this is for the American economy a very important step that is providing more fiscal support for growth over the next couple of years than the vast majority of observers thought plausible even a few weeks ago. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMuch as we regret the elements in it that do not seem to us to be prudent use of public resources, on balance the benefits to the economy make this a very worthwhile deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Snap quiz -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 If this was so -- what has jumped -- this 25 percent uptick -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, Goldman, all these people that are moving their growth charts from 2.5 percent to 3.5 or to 4 percent -- is it payroll tax?\xc2\xa0 Is it the extension of the tax cuts for the wealthy?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what -- what is it that really jumpstarted that growth?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Most of them were assuming that the Bush middle-class tax cuts would be continued.\xc2\xa0 And if that had broken down, they would have been having a negative revision. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe principal things that are driving it are, in order, the payroll tax holiday is probably the single most important factor. The second most important is the continuation of unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 The only reason I\xe2\x80\x99m not putting that equal is that many of the forecasters had already been assuming that the unemployment insurance would be extended, but they would all agree on it being very important.\xc2\xa0 And third, the expensing provisions, the expensing of investment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe refundable tax credits are enormously important to the people who are dependent on them who are many of the most vulnerable people in our society.\xc2\xa0 But because the amounts of money are smaller, they are less important to the macroeconomic outlook.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So payroll the most then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Payroll would be the most important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, Chuck, let me just add -- to build on what Larry said, the UI extension we\xe2\x80\x99ve been arguing -- and the House voted only a couple of weeks ago on a three-month extension of UI; we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen six-month extensions of UI -- this takes the politics out of UI all the way through 2011. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up.\xc2\xa0 Given the efficacy that you mentioned of the payroll tax holiday idea, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it part of the original stimulus?\xc2\xa0 It was on the table.\xc2\xa0 It was talked about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 It was discussed and at that time, the judgment was that continuation -- that the Make Work Pay tax credit that the President had talked about during the campaign, which had a similar basic idea -- raising middle-class families\xe2\x80\x99 tax checks -- paychecks -- was the way to go.\xc2\xa0 But this is where -- and that was the President\xe2\x80\x99s original proposal in this negotiation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut what came out of the compromise was the idea of the payroll tax holiday, which, frankly, a huge number of economists and other experts had been talking about over the last two years with a lot of support in both political parties.\xc2\xa0 And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s significant is we were able to achieve a payroll tax holiday that will provide significantly more fiscal support to the economy than a continuation of Make Work Pay would have.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s important also to recognize that even relative to the benchmark of the bill that passed the House, the combination of the payroll tax holiday, the total expensing, and the refundable tax credits means you\xe2\x80\x99re doing both more for vulnerable families and for the economy than the proposal that had passed through the House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the only reason that the payroll tax holiday will provide more stimulus is because it\xe2\x80\x99s twice as large.\xc2\xa0 Making Work Pay was capped.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you preserve Making Word Pay?\xc2\xa0 Is it because, as the President said some months ago, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a kind of invisible tax cut and didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide any political benefit for the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 No, it came out of the process of compromise with the Republicans who were more attracted to the payroll tax holiday concept, and that was a proposal that, as had been coming out of here, we had been giving considerable thought to in the context of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could comment on The New York Times report today that those at the lower end of the economic spectrum will actually be the only ones with less money in their pocket as a result of the deal because of the Making Work Pay elimination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good question.\xc2\xa0 You have to figure out what comparison you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.\xc2\xa0 It is true that for a $16,000 a year -- so that\xe2\x80\x99s an all-year, minimum-wage worker -- it is true that the Making Work Pay would have given that worker $400.\xc2\xa0 And this proposal, the payroll tax holiday, will give $320, and there is that $80 difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn the other hand, the proposal such as the House bill that contained the Making Work Pay would not have included any of the three refundable tax credits that I mentioned, which cumulatively, for that family, are on average worth several hundred dollars.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it depends on how many kids the family has and what the situation is -- but on average would work out to about $300 for such a family, one; two, would not have included the continuation of unemployment insurance benefits, which provide $300 a week in benefits; and three, takes no account of the extra growth increment that will come from this program.\xc2\xa0 If you raised GDP by 1 percent, that\'s $2,000 for the average family. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo as I\xe2\x80\x99ve emphasized, this was a compromise.\xc2\xa0 But if you look cumulatively at the elements that were in this compromise relative to no deal, or even relative to the bill that passed through the House, that $16,000-a-year family gets much more support from this bill than it would have in its absence.\xc2\xa0 And we believe you have to look at the totality of the program, not just take one provision from it and compare it with one provision in some other bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear, there are those on the lower end of the economic chart who will be -- who will not benefit in 2011 compared to 2010 in this deal, while everyone else on the financial spectrum will?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, that\'s not right.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not right.\xc2\xa0 What you just said is factually -- is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A single person, no family, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a child credit, $16,000 a year --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Right, that person will get $320.\xc2\xa0 That person will get $320 --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As opposed to $400 this year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a person who if they have\xc2\xa0 -- if they don\'t benefit from the unemployment insurance, if they don\'t benefit from the economic growth, if they don\'t benefit from the EITC or the childcare or the American Opportunity credit, might be $80 behind.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a far larger number of families, however, who will be hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars ahead because of the refundable tax credits, because of the unemployment insurance and because of the growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is a slightly less technical question, I think probably for David, and that is -- (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 You managed to offend us both.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You suggested that he can\xe2\x80\x99t handle the technical and that I can\xe2\x80\x99t handle the political.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re both offended.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 I was hoping you could explain to me what you just said.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, ignore my preface --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Much like your slight --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Happy holidays.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is whether, from a political point of view, it would have been better for these negotiations to have lasted a little bit longer to both force the Republicans to defend their estate tax provision and also to sort of make it appear to some that the President was really fighting and really just taking this because he had no other choice?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 So your question is, should we have staged a kind of kabuki dance for a while longer in order to exact some political advantage that might risk having people\xe2\x80\x99s taxes go up January 1st?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say the answer to that is no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody in the country who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand by now that the Republican Party fought hard and continues to fight hard for upper-income tax cuts and more generous treatment of wealthy estates.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they were after.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat we were after was for tax relief for middle-income families.\xc2\xa0 What we were after were measures that would add to economic growth, create jobs and buttress our economy and accelerate our recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe got what we wanted, and they got what they wanted.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what compromise is.\xc2\xa0 As Larry said, compromise doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you love every element of it.\xc2\xa0 Compromise means there are things you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to like and things you like.\xc2\xa0 But on balance, this was a winner.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd the thing we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do is play Russian roulette with people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk having UI end and people thrown off of that.\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t risk people\xe2\x80\x99s taxes going up on the average for a typical family by $3,000.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not good politics and it\xe2\x80\x99s not good policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Laura, let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 Economic forecasting is uncertain.\xc2\xa0 Our economy is growing slowly.\xc2\xa0 It is -- we have not achieved escape velocity and we have not stalled out.\xc2\xa0 If we had taken more time over this, the risk that the next thing that would happen would be the economy stalling out would have significantly magnified.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the cost of this, because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really gotten a cost estimate yet, and what kind of impact it will be on the deficit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 The bill is being scored as we speak by the Joint Tax Committee and, to lesser extent, by the CBO.\xc2\xa0 I gave the magnitudes of a variety of the provisions, and you can get them off of various fact sheets. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe deficits will be higher in the short run and lower in the long run because of this bill -- lower in the long run for two reasons:\xc2\xa0 because the frontloading of business allowances means more revenue collections after 2012, and because the extra economic growth lifts the economy, which in turn lifts tax collection.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there will be a significant increase -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the other side of the fiscal support -- in the magnitude of the deficit in 2011. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s long term?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s long term?\xc2\xa0 Define long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 2013 and on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Margaret. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this thing isn\xe2\x80\x99t done yet.\xc2\xa0 What if Democrats aren\xe2\x80\x99t just blowing off steam?\xc2\xa0 What if they just balk and say, forget it, we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing it, and it falls apart?\xc2\xa0 It seems to me like there would be pretty big political as well as economic implications.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could both take that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Well, could you run over there and tell them.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s your plan B?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think you need a plan B?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say, what animated the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to get something done quickly was what was best for the economy. I mean, as David said, well, you could do the kabuki dance.\xc2\xa0 My sense is you\xe2\x80\x99d have now a lot less time to get something actually through Congress if you ate up a week or two for no apparent benefit or reason. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut what has always animated him was how do we ensure that the certainty that we desire and what Larry talked about in terms of the estimates and growth and the jobs that this will help create -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of -- that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what animated him -- so that we did not get close to January 1st, that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves with millions of families facing that greater tax burden.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now that you have chosen not to draw it out to the last minute, Congress still has -- the Democrats still have to agree to this.\xc2\xa0 So I guess what I\'m saying is, are you pretty convinced that going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- I will say this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Failure to pass this bill in the next -- failure to pass this bill in the next couple weeks would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double-dip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that most people -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You believe a double-dip recession if this bill does not pass?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 -- what I said.\xc2\xa0 What I said was that it would significantly increase the risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the likelihood -- as Larry said, we wanted to get this done quickly. And I think as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen throughout the course of the day, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen more and more people both in and out of Washington -- no, actually --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually think it\xe2\x80\x99s like this, Margaret. I think the more people look at what is in this -- what Larry talked about, the reason that you had a surprise among people that looked at the economy is they didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you were -- they barely thought we\xe2\x80\x99d get UI.\xc2\xa0 They certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t think -- and you can ask people all over this town whether they thought that a 99-week benefit extended throughout 2011 was possible to obtain in an agreement like this, and most people would tell you there\xe2\x80\x99s no way.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll go to 72; you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get 99.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t think either Make Work Pay or the money involved in Make Work Pay would be in any agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Let alone doubled.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And it is concentrated in the economic activity of one year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but on the Hill you don\'t have it yet -- not officially, at least.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m asking is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, what I\'m saying, Margaret, is I think that -- I think as people look at this, and I think people as they understand the refundability of the tax credits that were not going to be in there -- they didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in there -- they basically thought we were doing this -- for high end, you\xe2\x80\x99d get a few months of UI.\xc2\xa0 We got certainty for the middle class, certainty for UI, the most stimulative thing, as Larry said, through the end of 2011; a payroll tax cut, 2 percent of up to $106,800, which is the level at which people no longer pay payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 Take your salary, multiply it by .02 -- that\'s your tax cut next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd all of that certainty, none of -- people did not think that was in that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think the more people look the what is in this, the more people will understand and agree that what is in this agreement exceeds what they thought would ever be in that agreement and far exceeds what will be in any agreement come January 5th.\xc2\xa0 It just won\'t be. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert, Barney Frank was saying, who I assume understands what\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill, and Chris Van Hollen -- says he\xe2\x80\x99s not voting for it, period.\xc2\xa0 Chris Van Hollen, who was part of the negotiating effort, understands what\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill, said that because of the estate tax provision he may not vote against it.\xc2\xa0 So you have people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 May not vote against it or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May not vote for it.\xc2\xa0 Excuse me.\xc2\xa0 So there are people who have looked at it and -- Democrats on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 So you can you guys just reflect on the division this seems to be causing within your own party?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you heard the President quite clear yesterday.\xc2\xa0 If we ran the world, David, we wouldn\'t have upper-income tax rate increases --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the leader of the free world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 President of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the leader of the free world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we can quibble about whether or not we have the ability to get anything we want to get done by waving the invisible magic wand that is somewhere in the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the ability -- we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do the upper-end tax rates, and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do the add-on to the estate tax.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tUnderstand that the amount of money, David, that we added through -- Kyl-Lincoln adds I think about $12 billion a year times two years on to the bottom line.\xc2\xa0 There were estate tax provisions -- right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re at zero.\xc2\xa0 If you pass away this year, regardless of the size of your estate, there is no exemption and there is no rate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo, again, would we have extended that above basically what I think a 2009 rate or something like that?\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what the compromise was.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut, David, I think if you look at the other side of that ledger, the refundability of those tax credits, the certainty of UI, most importantly the thing that costs the most money in this agreement, two years of those middle-class tax cuts, plus a concentrated at least 2 percent payroll tax cut -- that greatly outweighs, in our opinion, the benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of people understand that.\xc2\xa0 But then why is that still not working with people like Barney Frank and Chris Van Hollen?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they disagree with you on the contours.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 I guess the question back for those who ask that question is where does this go?\xc2\xa0 What is the endgame?\xc2\xa0 And what are the consequences of playing it?\xc2\xa0 Do they have a sense of how this ends?\xc2\xa0 And how long will that take?\xc2\xa0 Because as Larry said, there are real consequences to that.\xc2\xa0 Just as the forecast went up on the basis of this agreement, they will go down if this agreement fails.\xc2\xa0 That we know.\xc2\xa0 We know that on January 1st, people\xe2\x80\x99s taxes will go up.\xc2\xa0 We know that at the end of this month, 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 And so there are real consequences to that decision. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think we all stipulate, the President did, no one likes those provisions that they dislike.\xc2\xa0 But on the other side of the ledger are significant things that will help people and help the economy.\xc2\xa0 And what we know for sure is without any of it, we\xe2\x80\x99re facing a really, really difficult situation and families across this country will be facing a really difficult situation.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the choice that people need to take up. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that if this process were hypothetically to break down and a bill was not to be passed before this Congress recess, not only would the upwards revisions you\xe2\x80\x99ve all read about today be reversed, but a set of downwards revisions would commence because those who expected some unemployment insurance to continue would revise down their expectations.\xc2\xa0 The universal expectation that the Bush middle-class tax cuts would somehow get extended would be revised downwards.\xc2\xa0 Judgments about confidence would be revised downwards.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think at the end of the day that Congress will take a step that materially increases the risk that this economy would stall out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Larry, a couple of times you\xe2\x80\x99ve used the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cfiscal support for growth.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that fiscal stimulus?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is putting money in people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, so that they will have an opportunity to pay their debt down and be in a stronger position to spend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a second stimulus?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right way -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to think about it at all, actually.\xc2\xa0 The original Recovery Act included a whole set of spending measures directed at doing what I think at that time was very important, providing a major public investment support for the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this fiscal stimulus is a non-stimulus package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to play semantic games for you. These are fiscal measures that promote growth, in the judgment of the very substantial majority of economists who study these things and process them --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the bond yield, if we could just do this -- you guys -- how close are you watching the 10-year note?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s at 3.3 percent now.\xc2\xa0 Are you closely watching this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 I think you can safely assume that the public authorities watch the bond market very closely every day.\xc2\xa0 This day is no exception.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Larry, could you tell whether it makes any difference to do the payroll tax on the employee -- all on the employee side versus the employer side?\xc2\xa0 And, David, could you say whether you think the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to compromise is going to be a plus with independents?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 What most economists believe is the -- in the medium to long run, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really make a difference which side of the market you put a tax on.\xc2\xa0 In the short run, when wages are relatively rigid, by providing the tax on the employee side, you put money more quickly and more directly in people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets in the way that this is done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 In answer to your second question, look, I think the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t think in the same terms as people in this town and they\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking of this as a political strategy.\xc2\xa0 They just want the assurance of knowing that their taxes aren\xe2\x80\x99t going up, and they want us to do things that will produce accelerated growth and jobs.\xc2\xa0 And if we do that, I think that they\xe2\x80\x99ll look favorably on it.\xc2\xa0 If we don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, and this gets mired in the kind of Washington-style gridlock, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be angry.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll be angry at everyone.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not just going to be angry at one party or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo -- but the premise of your question perhaps is, what are the political calculations behind this?\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the political calculation -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do best when we do what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of people across this country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do best when we do what produces the greatest economic punch and gets people back to work at a more rapid pace.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only equation the President has been working on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the risk of trying to push you on this, there seems to be a conscious effort to put the President\xe2\x80\x99s face on this deal.\xc2\xa0 Robert has canceled his briefing two days running.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the President.\xc2\xa0 Talk to me about that and talk to me about the price of the President signing a deal that most Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t support, which this could be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, you heard Larry speak about the positive impacts of this and the potential negative impacts of not doing it.\xc2\xa0 This is a weighty decision for the country and for people across this country.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly appropriate for the President of the United States to be on point on this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xc2\xa0 We want people to understand the magnitude of this decision.\xc2\xa0 And so he\xe2\x80\x99s the person that needs to make that case and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make that case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President was passionate yesterday at the podium, but many Democrats on the Hill are saying they want to see that passion, they want to hear for themselves, they want the President to sell this bill to them.\xc2\xa0 Now, so far on the schedule it\xe2\x80\x99s not there for the President to go on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to go on the Hill to try to sell this to his party?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There is -- Vice President Biden was up at the Senate caucus --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With all respect, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, with all due respect, let me just try to finish my answer. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe was up at the Senate Democratic caucus.\xc2\xa0 I believe Jack Lew and Gene Sperling are back up there today -- because we understand people have a lot of questions.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is scheduled to at either 4:30 p.m. or 5:00 p.m. today go up and see the House Democratic parties.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude at some point that happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think that -- but I will say this, April.\xc2\xa0 I think the President in his statement announcing the agreement was outlining why he thought it was best for the economy.\xc2\xa0 When he was in here yesterday, he was doing that.\xc2\xa0 When he was with the Polish President, he was doing that.\xc2\xa0 And as we said to Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question, the President will continue to be out there ensuring that people understand what\xe2\x80\x99s in this, what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs David said, what happens on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day when people wake up and realize their taxes have gone up?\xc2\xa0 They blame everybody in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And the likelihood that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to then come back and somehow get an agreement that is tangibly better than where we are right now, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d really have to ask somebody who said that -- somebody who says, let\xe2\x80\x99s have some eight-week fight, and on February the 15th -- come in and say, all right, now, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to make a compromise.\xc2\xa0 Who on Earth\xc2\xa0 -- who on Earth thinks that that is somehow going to be a fundamentally better agreement than the one we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at now? Nobody that I have ever talked to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Ed Towns, outgoing head of Oversight and Government Reform, says he was disappointed.\xc2\xa0 He felt that he should -- the President should have held the line and the rich should pay more; that this country was founded on compromise, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a compromise.\xc2\xa0 It was giving the rich more and leaving the poor not getting what they deserved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 As Larry pointed out, the bill that the House passed would have been less kind to low-income people than the agreement that the President has reached.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to understand how you could vote for something less generous and then say this is not fair to low-income people.\xc2\xa0 We fought very hard to make sure that there was equity for people at the bottom of the income scale as well as the top and everyone in between.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\'m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 No, no, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President laid out -- outlined the tax cut compromise, he left some pretty important gaps in the equation.\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to include in any compromise an extension of the Build America Bonds program?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of provisions that are very important to the President that he would like to see ideally in the context of this bill; if not then, in the context of next year.\xc2\xa0 Build America Bonds is one of them.\xc2\xa0 The 1603 and 1705 programs are other examples.\xc2\xa0 And there are more as well. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere is much we can do to get this economy started.\xc2\xa0 As I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve emphasized repeatedly, this is a compromise, and therefore it does not reflect our ideal blueprint.\xc2\xa0 We would like to see it be better.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to pursue -- we won\xe2\x80\x99t, because I won\xe2\x80\x99t be here but -- (laughter) -- the President will continue --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Wait a second.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 -- the President will continue to pursue these priorities next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President would like to have it in this current bill, but if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out he would go for it for next year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s now a legislative process.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Build America Bonds have made a very important contribution to spurring the various kinds of construction at the state and local level to strengthening the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital markets.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them go forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This deal is take it or leave it, though, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think if somebody could improve it and convince everybody to still be on it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would say no.\xc2\xa0 I think the agreement that we have explained and we have outlined I think is the framework and the basis and the foundation of what Congress will ultimately consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Build America is not currently in that package that\xe2\x80\x99s been presented? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I wanted to ask you, you said a few minutes ago the agreement takes the UI -- the politics out of the UI extension for the next 13 months, through 2011.\xc2\xa0 Was there any consideration given to -- assuming you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to extend it again, which I think is a safe assumption, is there any consideration to having this fight again during the height of the Republican primary season?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think one year was what I think throughout the negotiations was there.\xc2\xa0 And if at the end of 2011, the President believes we need to seek an extension and a continuation of the 99-week benefit, I can assure you that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make that case.\xc2\xa0 Just as we did at other times in which Republicans refused initially or over the course of several votes to extend it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to fight for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear also that a three-month extension failed the House just in the last couple of weeks -- this House.\xc2\xa0 So this is a significant improvement over what couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pass this Democratic House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, could you comment on the role of the Vice President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me run around here for a second and we\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re open to at least tinkering with the compromise, so to speak, as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lose votes.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair assessment?\xc2\xa0 I have just a quick follow-up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the simplicity with which you made that statement.\xc2\xa0 I think the math and the physics and the blood and the sweat that might go and be involved in that I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure I would quite as simply submit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then the follow-up question is, you talked about your unwillingness to play Russian roulette with the economy at this juncture --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 And with the lives of the American people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with the lives of the American -- for Democrats who are now looking two years down the road to when these rates are going to expire now, what do you say to them when they ask why would you be willing to go to the mat to allow these rates to expire --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that we are going to be in a significantly different place in two years in our economy, assuming we make the right decisions here.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have also gone through a period where I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be painfully obvious the choices and the trade-offs involved in this.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have more leverage in that debate where the American people aren\xe2\x80\x99t in a position to be held hostage, Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd the truth is that the Republican position was they wanted a permanent increase in these tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 The President resisted that.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear he would veto that.\xc2\xa0 The second offer or line, was, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just do two years of the Bush tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 The President rejected that.\xc2\xa0 The President said he would veto that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I understand your question, but ours is not so much to worry about appearances.\xc2\xa0 Ours is to worry about the fate of the economy, how the American people are going to fare in a still difficult time.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s framing our decision-making here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to deficit reduction and whether there might be some conflicting signals here?\xc2\xa0 In saying he wants to freeze federal salaries, some would say that\'s a token decrease in the federal deficit.\xc2\xa0 But in prolonging the tax cuts for high-end Americans, that that is a potentially substantial increase in the deficit.\xc2\xa0 What are Americans who are watching from home --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Let me take that, if I could.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President has been consistent on this for quite a while.\xc2\xa0 We have got to do two things:\xc2\xa0 We have got to get growth and job creation going in the short run, and we have got to improve the picture in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe federal pay freeze isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a reduction in the budget deficit in the short run because pay is set on the basis of a raise, and then a raise, and then a raise from a base.\xc2\xa0 By reducing the pay -- by freezing payroll growth for the next two years, he reduced the deficit all the way out through the out-years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe tax measures in most cases here are explicitly temporary and are unlikely to be further extended and -- with the principal exception of the expensing tax provision, which is actually an increase in the taxes in 2015. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo to repeat what I said before, this bill will reduce the projected 2015 deficit -- reduce the projected 2015 deficit because of the increase in corporate tax collections in 2015 and by raising the benchmark forecast of GDP.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s actually very consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated priority for the long-run deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you comment on the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s role in reaching this agreement -- not from here forward, but reaching this agreement?\xc2\xa0 There are some members on the Hill who felt misled and felt that he had indicated that the President would be sticking and fighting on the high-end tax cuts more than actually occurred.\xc2\xa0 Was he the lead negotiator, the Vice President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the Vice President obviously -- I think has done a terrific job and got, as I said earlier, and I think we all have said, a very good agreement that remains imperfect.\xc2\xa0 And I think the Vice President would be the first person to tell you that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI want to say this.\xc2\xa0 The President has been opposed to extending the upper-end tax rates for -- you have heard me say that in this room a couple of thousand times probably since September -- the President has been opposed to increasing the upper-end rates since David and I worked for him when he ran for the United States Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe notion somehow that either we didn\'t fight for that or that was a position that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t apparent I just don\'t -- I fail to understand.\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President has -- I think he was tough in ensuring that refundability of important tax credits, an extension of the certainty of unemployment benefits, and in ensuring that the bang for the buck that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see by combining two years of Make Work Pay into a one-year employee payroll tax cut is a good deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 And I want to just add to that.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, his role at the outset of this was not as a negotiator.\xc2\xa0 His role was as someone who had relationships across the aisle in the Senate as a result of 36 years in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And he was -- in his soundings, he got a sense of what was possible and what was not possible. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe became more actively involved at the end in negotiations as things accelerated because of that relationship.\xc2\xa0 But one of the great values he has here is his knowledge of the Senate and the personalities there, years of relationships, and that\'s useful and we\xe2\x80\x99d be crazy not to take advantage of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I just want to make sure we ask about \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d because there\xe2\x80\x99s a big vote in the Senate tonight.\xc2\xa0 What kind of calls is the President making?\xc2\xa0 Is he talking to senators who are on the fence and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a list of whom, but the President has over the course of the past several days made calls to Democrats and Republicans on two very important issues to him:\xc2\xa0 passage of the DREAM Act and repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell\xe2\x80\x9d. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think we are -- on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t ask, don\'t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d I think we are very, very close to seeing that repeal pass.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve had important endorsements over the past few days.\xc2\xa0 And I think, in many ways, as a result of the process and the survey that the Pentagon issued last week, the President is hopeful and encouraging Democrats and Republicans to get behind that repeal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 This administration, as you know, Mr. Summers, predicted that with the passage of a $787 billion stimulus plan, the unemployment rate wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t jump above 8 percent.\xc2\xa0 And obviously that didn\'t come to pass.\xc2\xa0 How difficult is it for you as an economic advisor to the President to come out here and talk about your forecasts about what this economic stimulus plan will do for the U.S. economy?\xc2\xa0 And how difficult is it for you to make this same argument to the skeptical members that you have of your party?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to distinguish between what is unknowable and what is relatively easy to judge based on economic models.\xc2\xa0 What can be judged, based on economic models, is the change in our language, the delta associated with a given program.\xc2\xa0 What is impossible to know is what shocks will hit the economy in the future, what traditional relationships will break down, what kinds of surges in confidence will or will not take place. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I would not presume to be able to judge with any significant degree of accuracy what the growth rate will precisely be, or what the unemployment rate will be at a given date as was recognized in that forecast.\xc2\xa0 Those are extremely uncertain.\xc2\xa0 What one can judge is what the impact of a given change will be.\xc2\xa0 I know that if I wear my coat home tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a bunch warmer than if I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear my coat home tonight.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the temperature is going to be when I walk home tonight. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn the same way, we are able to make estimates of the impact of a change.\xc2\xa0 And, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just our judgment, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the judgment of a very broad range of economists that the measures that have come along as part of this compromise that most people did not expect would be legislated this year will materially and significantly affect growth, the number of jobs, and the unemployment rate over the next year or two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was it a mistake to make that initial forecast about the U.S. unemployment rate dropping --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of congressional Democrats came out of caucus yesterday and said they were seeking modifications to the tax package.\xc2\xa0 How locked in are you to the specifics of this package, especially with Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Do you think this is the only package that can get the votes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would repeat what I said I think when Sam asked about that.\xc2\xa0 I think what we have laid out, what you have seen, and what Vice President Biden and the President have talked about, is the foundation, the framework of an agreement that we expect to be voted on.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what types of changes those individual members are talking about.\xc2\xa0 But as David said in an early answer, too, the agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined is materially better than -- includes more aspects that help all ranges of middle- and working-class families that weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in earlier legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you promise Republicans you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change this?\xc2\xa0 Is this where you\xe2\x80\x99re locked in?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is the basis of -- the framework of what will ultimately be voted on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- just to small, little additions?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cframework.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you, again, to what I said to Sam.\xc2\xa0 Again, understanding that -- look, if somebody can figure out how to change this thing and keep everybody happy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that -- Bill, let me just finish my answer, if I can.\xc2\xa0 If somebody can figure out how to get that done, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that anybody on Capitol Hill or here would listen.\xc2\xa0 I will say that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be an easy thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJackie, then Ben, and then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said that he is calling people on the DREAM Act and the \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 No plans yet to go to the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is he calling anyone about this tax package?\xc2\xa0 Is he bringing people in? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any calls he\xe2\x80\x99s made specifically around this at this point.\xc2\xa0 Again, the Vice President has been up yesterday, staff up today, and the Vice President up also later today to the House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t feel he needs to be personally --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he was personally involved on Monday.\xc2\xa0 I think he was personally involved on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I think he is personally involved today.\xc2\xa0 I think, as Wendell said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a one-on-one basis?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t preclude that that will happen --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk on the Hill or sense that White House aides, no names attached, are putting out word that they\xe2\x80\x99re to blame for this issue being here at the end of the year and that\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x99s an intentional tactic on you all\xe2\x80\x99s part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Jackie, I think that to people in the country who are watching this, they\xe2\x80\x99re a heck of a lot less interested in us trying to blame people for failure than in succeeding, and making sure that their taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up; that our economy improves; that unemployment insurance continues for people who need it.\xc2\xa0 And we should spend less time worrying about pointing fingers and more time working to get this done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re urging.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s point, it seems like this argument that we heard Larry make about potential risk, significant risk of a double-dip recession is obviously serious and compelling.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that the President would call lawmakers about and say, can we get this done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Fret not, my friends.\xc2\xa0 Fret not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but can you provide --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s all --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- some context?\xc2\xa0 Is that the kind of thing in a delicate matter like this that you do maybe closer to a vote?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say this?\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to get into semantics about calls versus -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re way past that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s interacted with the leaders of Congress.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s interacted with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 He got a chance to chat, however briefly, with members of Congress Monday night on this.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s interacting with -- the President is interacting with members of Congress all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tRobert\xe2\x80\x99s point is he\xe2\x80\x99s also saying publicly what he would say privately about why this is important.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s making his case not just to the members but to the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I doubt there are many on Capitol Hill who don\'t have a sense of where he is on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I ask a non-semantic --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other topic we wanted to ask about was on START.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke very confidently about that today -- he expects it to come up and be debated and passed.\xc2\xa0 Can you offer any context about what that confidence right now is based upon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you look at the past several days, Senator Gregg, retiring senator from New Hampshire, said good things about the START deal -- the START treaty just yesterday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think you have seen members -- particularly Republican members -- Senator Corker, Senator Voinovich and others who have said they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see this thing -- Senator McCain -- like to see this treaty come up and like to see this treaty ratified this year -- not to mention the eloquent arguments that the past five Republican secretaries of state have made publicly and privately to their colleagues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI, like the President, believe that this will come before the Senate before it goes home.\xc2\xa0 I think the Senate will have a full and robust debate on this.\xc2\xa0 And I think when they go home, the President will have passed a significant portion of his nonproliferation agenda that will considerably cut the deployed nuclear weapon stockpile that each of these countries has pointing at each other right now.\xc2\xa0 And we know in parts of the world, those type of weapons falling into the hands of terrorists would be unthinkable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you have the votes right now?\xc2\xa0 Or is that going too far?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if they voted on it right now, it would pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question?\xc2\xa0 Did Senator McConnell say -- guarantee that -- or commit to making sure there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be any blocking of trying to bring this up, or that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t any -- on START?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Speaker Pelosi -- still -- has said that the estate tax is \xe2\x80\x9ca bridge too far,\xe2\x80\x9d she called it.\xc2\xa0 I notice that you did not mention that, Larry, in your opening five things that this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t hear it stressed --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 I mentioned two things that we had compromised on that the President strongly disapproved of -- the high-income tax cuts and the estate tax.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And -- I mean, a Republican member told me yesterday they were stunned that the estate tax was thrown in, $5 million they didn\'t even think was on the table.\xc2\xa0 So the question is, could you have just as good a deal without that estate tax provision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Not in the judgment to the people who negotiated the deal.\xc2\xa0 I think it was very clear that while it was surprising to some, the Republicans were enormously committed to delivering that benefit to what is, after all, only 6,400 families.\xc2\xa0 And therefore a whole range of things that they had previously been very, very uncomfortable with -- support for middle-income families, unemployment insurance --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Bill, let me just add to what Larry said -- that\'s -- people were also surprised that we got 13 months of UI. People were surprised that we got these refundable tax credits.\xc2\xa0 People were surprised that we got the payroll tax cut in here.\xc2\xa0 So there were surprises on both sides.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the ledger, we came away with more significant tax relief for the middle class and more for the economy than anybody thought possible.\xc2\xa0 So the nature of this compromise is there were surprises on both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get Richard, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow on that answer, David.\xc2\xa0 If that\'s the case, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with this picture that you have Republicans pretty much in agreement that this is a good deal and the Democrats squawking? You would think if it was a compromise, you\xe2\x80\x99d have equal numbers on both sides dissatisfied.\xc2\xa0 And it seems like all the dissatisfaction is on the Democratic side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if you guys get Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s tweet, but it does not appear she likes this deal.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where Jim DeMint is at the current moment but it does not appear that he likes said deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. AXELROD:\xc2\xa0 Representative Bachman was critical because she didn\'t like the unemployment insurance elements of it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s dissent on their side.\xc2\xa0 Admittedly, they\'re better at stifling dissent on their side than we are.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But you know, the Democratic Party is democratic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has Senator McConnell committed to giving the majority of Republicans will vote for this deal as currently -- have they actually committed to that to you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where that discussion -- if that discussion was had or where it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJake, did you have something?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask about the report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that came out I believe yesterday, but sometime this week -- stating that it\xe2\x80\x99s the judgment of the intelligence community that five detainees released or transferred from Guantanamo under President Obama, under this new revised system -- two of them are confirmed returned to terrorism; three of them are suspected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this is causing -- since this new system has -- requires the unanimous vote of all the members of this group, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this is causing anyone in the administration to think that maybe this revised system isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough.\xc2\xa0 I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s a smaller number than happened under Bush.\xc2\xa0 And I know that you never said that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there are now going to be any changes in the procedure?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would, first and foremost, refer you to the comment that we put out and the comments from DNI. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That didn\xe2\x80\x99t address that, though, on whether there would be revisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that we will certainly continue, based on all sorts of information coming from all over the world in order to make determinations about the likelihood that some are more susceptible to -- upon leaving Guantanamo Bay, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re more susceptible to returning to terrorism.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that they will continue to evaluate that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tObviously -- and I have not read the full report, but in a number of these -- in some cases -- and, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take these five -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact reasoning behind -- go back and look at the report -- but in many cases -- in some cases, some of the transfers have been -- some of the transfers are required by law, because there is not either sufficient evidence with which to charge individuals and there\xe2\x80\x99s not sufficient reason to continue to hold them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick oil question?\xc2\xa0 Oil prices are up really high.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 And -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. SUMMERS:\xc2\xa0 Oil goes up and oil goes down.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:16 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
