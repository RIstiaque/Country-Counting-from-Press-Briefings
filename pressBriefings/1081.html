EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back from the Labor Day weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have a short announcement here.\xc2\xa0 I would like to provide you with an update on the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing response to a number of events affecting areas across the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, as you know, the President visited New Jersey to survey damage there and meet with local officials, including Governor Christie.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, DHS Secretary Napolitano toured damage in Connecticut from Hurricane Irene and met with state and local officials, including Governor Malloy and first responders.\xc2\xa0 FEMA, through its regional officials in Atlanta, New York, and Denton, Texas, is also closely monitoring the remains of Tropical Depression Lee as it moves over southeastern states.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also we are monitoring the major fires in Texas.\xc2\xa0 This past weekend, at the request of the Texas governor, seven fire management assistance grants were approved by this administration for the ongoing firefighting efforts there.\xc2\xa0 In total, we have approved 52 fire management assistance grants requested by the governor during this fire season, as well as a major disaster declaration to help cover expenses from earlier emergency response efforts this past July.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work closely with the state and local emergency management officials as their efforts to contain these fires continue. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I will go to the Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you know what the amount is of these grants?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get that for you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a proportion of the cost of fighting a fire, is my understanding how these grants work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner and Representative Cantor, they issued a letter, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw, to President Obama in which they appear to try to zero in on areas of common interest, including infrastructure, and said that there should not be an all-or-nothing solution to creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys see this as an opening, important opening, or are you dubious, given the partisanship of the recent days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said now for quite some time that we hope and expect that members of Congress, rank and file and leader, will come back from their recession newly focused on the need to address the economy, to take measures that we can take together in a bipartisan way to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome signs that that level of interest in bipartisan cooperation has increased. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We certainly think, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that we expect that members of Congress -- House and Senate -- heard in their districts and states the same kinds of things from their constituents that the President heard when he visited the Midwest on his bus tour and previous trip as well, that there is a level of frustration with Washington that is palpable, and that Americans of all stripes, whether they are registered Republicans or independents or Democrats, whether they -- no matter how they voted or how they will vote, are tired of gridlock and political posturing getting in the way of Washington doing the things that can and should be done to help them and help the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s important here is that gridlock and obstructionism are not new.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, obviously, for a long time, those of us who have been in Washington and watched it.\xc2\xa0 What was unique about what Americans saw this summer was that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just frustrating, it was harmful, it was dangerous.\xc2\xa0 It had a direct negative impact on the economy, on confidence -- consumer confidence and business confidence.\xc2\xa0 And while expectations for what Washington can do are tempered with skepticism, Americans should not have to expect that Washington will, by its actions, actually harm the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House been consulting at all with Republican leaders in Congress ahead of the speech on some of these areas of potential bipartisan agreement, to build support to speed this thing along?\xc2\xa0 Or are they going to hear about any new ideas along with the rest of the country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this question as well last week.\xc2\xa0 The President has, throughout this year and certainly throughout the spring and summer, been in regular consultation with members of Congress and leaders of both parties.\xc2\xa0 Consultations and preparations for his jobs and growth package were wide-ranging, both inside and outside the administration.\xc2\xa0 And the ideas the President collected helped inform him as he made his decisions for this package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will be consulting with leaders of Congress going forward as he moves forward, by presenting his jobs and growth package to the Congress, by calling on them to act.\xc2\xa0 You will see that it is a significant proposal, but it contains ideas that have historically garnered bipartisan support by the very members who will sit in the hall on Thursday night.\xc2\xa0 So he hopes that the imperative to help the economy, to grow the economy, to create jobs, will trump political partisanship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic, please.\xc2\xa0 The AP has had a series of reports based on documents that show the New York Police Department has put the Muslim community around New York under scrutiny using undercover officers and informants to monitor restaurants and mosques and social groups.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see this as a best practice for combating extremism?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Ben, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of those reports so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like it might well be addressed to DHS or other agencies, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the turbulence in markets is reflecting growing concern about the European crisis.\xc2\xa0 What advice is the President giving to his European counterparts about this?\xc2\xa0 And is this going to be a part of his speech, given that this turmoil could very well affect the U.S. economy in a very big way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll make two points.\xc2\xa0 First, we are in regular consultation with our European counterparts at a variety of levels -- the President obviously with his counterparts, Secretary Geithner with his.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner will be in France for a ministerial-level meeting of the G7 -- G8, rather, on this weekend, on Friday.\xc2\xa0 And those consultations are ongoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Europeans face a difficult challenge, but we believe that they have both the ability and the will to meet their obligations and we continue to believe that.\xc2\xa0 As for the effect of what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening in Europe on our economy, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there is an impact.\xc2\xa0 We have acknowledged that previously, which is why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that we continue to consult with and coordinate with our counterparts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President -- going to your question about his speech -- believes that one thing we can do when we talk about our economy is control the things we can control, take action where we can take action to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there have been events this year that are out of our control completely, like an earthquake and a tsunami, that have affected our economy -- the Arab Spring, the uprisings there that have affected oil prices that have affected our economy, and the situation in Europe, which we have some role with our European counterparts in, but obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s not completely within our control.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These things happen and we deal with them.\xc2\xa0 While we are dealing with them, we should take action where we can.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President feels so strongly that on Thursday night, as you will hear, we need to do the things we can do to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 The package he will put forward will absolutely be judged by independent economic analysts to, if passed, have a direct, quick and positive impact on the economy and job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President confident in how the European leaders are handling this crisis?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that they need to handle the crisis, and we believe they have the ability and the will.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been grappling with it obviously for a while now, and we understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that they are working hard to address it.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as well as Secretary Geithner and others, are in regular consultation with them on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just shifting topics.\xc2\xa0 The decision to give the speech to a joint session of Congress -- one of the reasons you said the President wanted to do that is because Congress would need to pass at least some of these initiatives; some may be by executive action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given, though, that the views on how you spur growth at the moment are just so different -- the Republicans criticize what they see as a Keynesian approach and want permanent overhauls of the tax code and things like that, and a new look at regulations -- can you talk a little bit more about why the President wants to do this when the philosophical difference couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be greater?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question to point out that there are areas that we know have and have enjoyed bipartisan support, measures that we can take.\xc2\xa0 One thing the President has spoken about is extending the payroll tax cut, a tax cut for millions and millions of Americans, working Americans -- money that puts on average a thousand dollars back in the wallets of average American families across the country, has done for this year.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to see it happen again next year.\xc2\xa0 We believe that should have bipartisan support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are other measures.\xc2\xa0 The infrastructure bank that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about has bipartisan support, has the support of labor and business, for example.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of measures that we believe have enjoyed bipartisan support -- can, should and will enjoy bipartisan support this fall if people are serious about -- if members of Congress are serious about trying to help the economy, which we believe is their number one obligation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what their constituents are demanding. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have serious differences.\xc2\xa0 Some of the measures that you talked about -- you can have a debate about some of the things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, tax reform and regulatory reform.\xc2\xa0 The President is for both of those and has his own ideas about them and has taken measures on regulations already, as you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is indisputable is that we need to do things that will have a direct impact in the short term to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the President will put forward proposals that do just that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think that\xe2\x80\x99s where the difference is, because even on the payroll tax, Republicans are saying it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do the economy a whole lot of good to just extend a temporary tax cut temporarily. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they would have to consult with economists who disagree significantly with that.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that that tax cut has a direct impact on job growth and economic growth; has had this year and would have if it were extended.\xc2\xa0 And other measures that we will propose that have had bipartisan support in the past, precisely because they are judged by independent analysts to have a direct impact on the economy and jobs, should have that kind of support again in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also be clear that the President will make it absolutely clear that he will pay for these proposals.\xc2\xa0 He knows that\xe2\x80\x99s important and it is part of his commitment to deficit reduction and long-term debt reduction, getting our deficits and debt under control.\xc2\xa0 He was very aggressive in pursuing that in his negotiations with John Boehner, Speaker of the House, and he will continue to be aggressive in pushing for substantial deficit and debt reduction in a comprehensive way, a way that is balanced, that makes sure that none of the burden -- that the burden, rather, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall solely on one segment of society but that it\xe2\x80\x99s shared.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way, as, again, a broad consensus agrees, the best way to tackle our deficits and long-term debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in the speech that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about, but it does seem like infrastructure spending is going to be part of it; he\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned it several times, including yesterday.\xc2\xa0 There obviously were hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure spending in the stimulus bill, and while that bill may have stemmed the bleeding, it obviously did not prompt the kind of economic recovery that the President had hoped.\xc2\xa0 Why would a new round of infrastructure spending have a different effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think your analysis of the Recovery Act -- hundreds of billions I think may be overstating the amount of actual infrastructure spending.\xc2\xa0 But the -- remember, what a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t widely reported, is that a third of the Recovery Act -- fully a third\xc2\xa0 -- was tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 And then --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s still $550 billion --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then assistance to states and -- there were a lot of different components of it.\xc2\xa0 Hundreds of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- will get us a number.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get that for you.\xc2\xa0 But the point is, what is uncontestable is that those infrastructure projects that were funded by the Recovery Act were very well managed, came in on budget or under budget and led to the creation of many, many jobs by an outside, independent analyst.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, broadly, the Recovery Act, I think it was over 3 million jobs -- created or supported over 3 million jobs -- created or saved over 3 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, did it fill the hole created by 8 million jobs lost, the answer is no, because 8 million jobs is more than the 3 million that the Recovery Act created or saved.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how dire the situation was that we encountered when the President was sworn into office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What it definitely did was, together with the other initiatives the President took in conjunction with Congress, is prevented us from falling into a Great Depression and began the slow but steady road to recovery, which has led to more than 2 million private sector jobs created in the last 18 months and economic growth rather than economic contraction.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is arguing that the growth we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this year is anywhere near robust enough or that the job creation we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even this year, there have been a million private sector jobs created.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly think that the initiatives taken -- put forward by the President, taken up by Congress and passed -- had a lot to do with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a new ABC News poll/Washington Post poll out today that shows a record high of the American people disapproving of the President\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the economy, of the deficit, of job creation.\xc2\xa0 One in three Americans say they\xe2\x80\x99re worse off now than when President Obama -- than before President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to these people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That he is working every day to take the necessary measures to grow the economy and create jobs, that he fully understands the anxiety that is out there among the American people about the economy, the frustration at the pace of growth, the frustration at the pace of job creation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he feels it is so urgent to take action now and not to simply say, oh, well, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything and then let it all be decided next year after an election. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The American people don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve that.\xc2\xa0 They deserve action now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President will call for action now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, Jay, in January, President Obama said after the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, \xe2\x80\x9cAt a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized, at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all the ails of the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to pause for a moment, make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did he mean that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course he did. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the comments -- how did the comments by the Teamsters\xe2\x80\x99 president fit in with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, those weren\xe2\x80\x99t comments by the President.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, and as I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported by --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Comments by a union leader at an event that President Obama spoke at.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand that there is a ritual in Washington that somebody says something and you link the associations, and then everybody who has an association with him or her somehow has to avow or disavow it.\xc2\xa0 The President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there -- I mean, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on stage.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak for another 20 minutes.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\xc2\xa0 I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment beyond that, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, some of us covered the campaign and recall a time when somebody made some harsh comments about then-Senator Obama while -- during the introduction of a McCain rally and the Obama campaign was offended and expected an apology, and Senator McCain came out and did so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Hoffa speaks for himself.\xc2\xa0 He speaks for the labor movement, the AFL-CIO.\xc2\xa0 The President speaks for himself.\xc2\xa0 I speak for the President. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What the President was glad to do yesterday was have the opportunity to present his views on the importance of working Americans and on the importance of taking measures to help working Americans --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so the precedent --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to create jobs and grow the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the precedent you\xe2\x80\x99re setting right now for the 2012 election is, the candidate -- the Republican candidates are the ones that we need to pay attention to, and those who introduce them at rallies, their surrogates -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay attention to anything that they say.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I really -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said what I can say about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just -- is that the standard now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can report it as you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not have to do this Washington Kabuki every time something happens --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you to do the Kabuki --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but if that\xe2\x80\x99s the standard -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s the standard, then --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The standard is, we should focus on the actions we can take to grow the economy and create jobs, instead of focusing on Kabuki theater. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President find the comments appropriate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can we move on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, given the anticipation that\xe2\x80\x99s building up to Thursday, is the White House -- is the President concerned that the expectations set for the speech are simply way too high?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just -- short of producing 8 million jobs, what can this man do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Every day, he can do what he can and focus on the things that we can do, working with Congress or independently as the administration -- administratively, rather, to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously not something that\xe2\x80\x99s done in a day.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s work that will continue beyond Thursday, as we push for Congress to take action on this package.\xc2\xa0 And it will be part of an overall effort, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned, regarding the President\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term view about where we need to move this economy that includes long-term investments in infrastructure, innovation and education, and tackling our long-term deficit and debt problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the answer is -- obviously the work does not get done in one day or one night.\xc2\xa0 This is a multi-step process that hopefully results in Congress taking appropriate action to grow the economy and create jobs, action that, if passed in its entirety, would have significant impact immediately or within the year on economic growth and job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans are already expressing frustration that this is being called bipartisan, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not being consulted in advance at all, and Democrats expressing frustration that they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing legislation will be delivered to them, and they think, hey, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got our plans of our own -- why are we getting this from on high?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Jessica, when we say that the proposals the President will put forward have had -- are the kinds that have had bipartisan support in the past, we are speaking the truth, and you will be able to judge when you see whether that is the case.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that this is part of a bipartisan negotiation that has created this plan.\xc2\xa0 In terms of consultations, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware that when the Republicans drew up H.R. 1, they had invited Democrats to write it with them, or the Ryan plan, or any of their economic proposals going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What they do is put those proposals forward, and they are judged on the merits in Congress and by the American people as to whether or not they are centrist, have bipartisan support, or whether they are too partisan or too political.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will put forward a proposal -- the President will put forward a proposal that is made up of component parts that have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past.\xc2\xa0 Not only that, they will be paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you think your relations with Congress are at a reasonable enough place that these can pass?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what, I think that the American people do not care whether or not we express niceties.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 Civility is important, and we\xe2\x80\x99re all for it.\xc2\xa0 What American people care about is that Congress -- Washington, in general -- take action; take the kind of action that will improve the economic situation in the United States, both in the near term and the long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how much would you characterize is in this speech of new proposals that we have not already heard the President or the administration talk about or float?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that you will hear some new proposals that you have not heard us talk about or float.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I turn to Afghanistan and ask whether the President has received a recommendation from Secretary Panetta to reduce the number of troop levels to about 3,000 by year\xe2\x80\x99s end?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you mean Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me, Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I misspoke.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And the process has -- as you know, we are operating under a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government that was signed by the previous administration to draw down our forces.\xc2\xa0 We are in negotiations, consultations with the Iraqi government about what our relationship with Iraq will look like going forward.\xc2\xa0 We want a normal, productive, healthy relationship with Iraq going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have said in the past that if the security component of that relationship -- if the Iraqi government makes a request of us, we will certainly consider it.\xc2\xa0 That request has not been made.\xc2\xa0 No decisions have been made.\xc2\xa0 And so we are operating as of now under the existing agreements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand those negotiations are underway.\xc2\xa0 But the question specifically, though, is has Secretary Panetta delivered a recommendation to the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think what I -- this is contingent upon what our relationship looks like with Iraq, and that component of it depends on our negotiations with the Iraqi government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will budgetary concerns be a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision about how many troops to leave in Iraq?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has I think made abundantly clear for a long time now that he will end and has ended our efforts in Iraq, our combat efforts, responsibly.\xc2\xa0 We have been operating on a timetable that has withdrawn over 100,000 U.S. forces since he took office in a way that has been incredibly careful and responsible, and has allowed the Iraqis to further build up their security forces and improve their capacities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what our relationship looks like going forward with Iraq will depend upon our negotiations with the Iraqi government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And not concerns about how much it costs?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we live in a world where resources aren\xe2\x80\x99t infinite, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the case with every consideration we make.\xc2\xa0 But the answer is we will make decisions based on what is the best for the United States, best for our national security interests and best for having the most effective relationship with Iraq going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to the poll that Jake cited, the recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll also found the President\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings at an all-time low.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the President about these numbers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can honestly tell you that I have spent quite a bit of time with the President this week, last week; this did not get raised.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on the measures he can take as President of the United States, either administratively or working with Congress legislatively, to address the urgent need to grow our economy and create jobs; to deal with the fact that economic growth is not fast enough and that job creation is not substantial enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that this is one of those cases where good policy makes good politics.\xc2\xa0 What he is focused on is doing what the American people are demanding that Washington do, which is listen to them and not spend a lot of time trying to score political points and winning ideological battles on the fringes.\xc2\xa0 What Washington -- what Americans saw, to their horror, was that in the name of ideological purity Washington almost brought the global economy to its knees this summer -- for no other reason than to try to prove an ideological political point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And it had -- even though it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and that calamitous result was averted, the impact was felt on confidence among consumers and among businesses.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just not okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be some concern given the fact that these numbers show that the majority of Americans have lost faith in the President and this government to actually fix this economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the American people, if you look at your poll and other polls, make abundantly clear that they have a high reservoir of skepticism towards Washington in general.\xc2\xa0 And I think that has been exacerbated dramatically by what they witnessed this summer, where the opportunity to do something sweeping and bold and bipartisan was squandered because there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the political will to make it happen.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing registered in your polls, where I think everyone associated with Washington is being viewed quite dimly right now. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken with someone who said that these ideas that were put forth -- we heard yesterday from the President -- are ideas that have been talked about before, that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot of confidence that this speech will have new ideas.\xc2\xa0 And I know you told Norah there will be some new ideas.\xc2\xa0 Given that we\xe2\x80\x99re so close to the speech, can you tell us what percentage of this plan will be new?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s new to some is not new to others.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a limited universe of things that can be done.\xc2\xa0 I think economists will be very clear with you, if you call them up and talk to them, about the things that we can do in Washington to effect growth, effect job creation in a positive way. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But within the sort of basket areas, there are new ideas and new proposals that you will hear.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a percentage for you, because it depends on how broadly you\xe2\x80\x99ve read up on it.\xc2\xa0 And I would also make the point that just because you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it somewhere out there in Washington doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it from us. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President has consulted widely.\xc2\xa0 He has listened to ideas from the private sector to -- from economists inside and outside the administration and considered a vast array of ideas.\xc2\xa0 And he will put forward his proposal, a collection of ideas that he thinks will have the most effective impact on the economy and jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, just finally, 72 percent of Americans believe that the economy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t hit rock bottom yet.\xc2\xa0 What would you say to those people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That this President is doing everything he can to make sure that we continue to grow the economy and create jobs, that we improve our economic situation, and that he will call on Congress to join him in doing that, and suggest that not doing it, not acting, will be highly unresponsive to what the American people are demanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the decision last week on the ozone regulation.\xc2\xa0 Was that a product of a sort of wrenching debate within the White House with a lot of disagreement, or was there sort of a fair amount of consensus that this was the right thing to do, given all of the factors?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into an internal process here.\xc2\xa0 It was the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 He laid out the reasoning behind the decision in his statement.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from others who have explained it in more detail.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was -- it was a normal process internally.\xc2\xa0 Normal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A normal process, what does that mean?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was -- I would just say it was -- obviously these processes are -- decisions are discussed.\xc2\xa0 This was the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 He made the decision.\xc2\xa0 He laid out his reasoning again in the statement that we put out, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Normally the President comments on the monthly jobs numbers.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that this time.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason why?\xc2\xa0 And do you expect him to address those?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that there have been occasions when I worked for the Vice President where the Vice President commented.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had traditionally economic advisors, either the CEA chair, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have one who has been confirmed at the moment, who have gone out -- Gene Sperling, the NEC director went out -- no particular reason. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on -- I mean, a lot of people -- you ask instantly was how does that change his jobs proposal.\xc2\xa0 The jobs numbers were just another indication of why we need to do what the President is going to ask Congress to do on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 So there was -- it\xe2\x80\x99s completely consistent with his estimation that we need to take action to get the economy growing again and to get more jobs created.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the White House know the Labor Day rally yesterday would be as partisan an event as it turned out to be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- the President enjoyed the opportunity to speak to the audience there, to honor working men and women in this country, and to make clear what he believes is the urgent need to take action to grow the economy and create jobs, which is what he will be discussing on Thursday evening in Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how to characterize it.\xc2\xa0 The President was invited.\xc2\xa0 He came, he spoke.\xc2\xa0 And he was grateful to have the opportunity to deliver his messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is your answer to Senator McConnell, who used an op-ed today to again call on the administration to send those free trade agreements to Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, and as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, we look forward to submitting the free trade agreements as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 The next step is to nail down the remaining specifics on a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to move forward with all three agreements and with TAA, trade adjustment assistance, in a timely fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There has been progress made in the Senate and we hope that progress will continue to be made so that we can move forward on those agreements.\xc2\xa0 And I would just note that TAA is something that has, again, enjoyed wide bipartisan support in the past and we believe it should this time around as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McConnell said TAA is unions extracting concessions from the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there has been broad bipartisan support for TAA in the past.\xc2\xa0 There was support among significant senior members in the House, Republican members in the House for it.\xc2\xa0 And we believe there can and will be support for it moving forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on that, congressional leaders have already committed to taking those up.\xc2\xa0 So why not send the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we will reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the sequencing and the process by which these will all be taken up.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully we will see passage of the free trade agreements and TAA, and enjoy the benefits that will come from that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration wants them as one package, then.\xc2\xa0 So what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate how it works from here; you can talk to folks on the Hill about that.\xc2\xa0 But we believe an agreement can be reached and should be reached, and that we can move forward and get those passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he send them up Thursday along with his speech Thursday night?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timing announcement to make on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow up on Caren\xe2\x80\x99s question on the European debts and the markets today.\xc2\xa0 Did the President get any briefings today on the markets on what was going on in Europe?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s been here and has been in meetings all day, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he did.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t present for that particular one, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he has been briefed on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said he\xe2\x80\x99s been in constant consultation with his counterparts in Europe.\xc2\xa0 Has he called Merkel or Sarkozy today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0 I believe he spoke with Chancellor Merkel over the weekend, but that was a personal call expressing condolences for the loss of her father.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing -- does Mr. Geithner plan to have -- have any suggestions at G8 later this -- or G7 later this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would steer you towards the Treasury Department for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up on that one?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President traveled to Detroit yesterday with several labor leaders on the plane with him, I think.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us kind of what those labor leaders said to the President, and what, perhaps, he promised them?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, and I think that the President probably discussed his commitment to helping working Americans and his commitment to growing the economy and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- that\xe2\x80\x99s been his focus pretty intensely of late and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that was the nature of the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I traveled Sunday, not Monday, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Palestinian Authority President, Mahmoud Abbas, said over the weekend that he planned to go ahead with an effort to get recognition of a state at the U.N. this month, something that the President has come out against and American officials have said the U.S. would veto.\xc2\xa0 Given that it looks like the Palestinians are going to press on with this, does the administration have a plan B for how to deal with the aftermath of recognition of Palestinian statehood?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have made clear, as you know, that we do not believe that this will bring the Palestinians -- if this action were taken or this approach were followed through, that it would have -- bring the Palestinians any closer to statehood, that peace has to be negotiated directly by both parties.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to encourage both sides to come back together in direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 There is no substitute for serious and substantive negotiations between the parties.\xc2\xa0 That has been the case and remains the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to achieve statehood through this means, and we think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made our opinion on that pretty clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President worry, given all the work he\xe2\x80\x99s put into responding to the Arab Spring, that having an American veto of an Arab people seeking statehood, seeking recognition, sends a bad signal to other Arabs who also aspire for freedoms and recognition?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s some speculation about actions we\xe2\x80\x99ll take embedded in that, and I will simply say that we continue to believe that this is not the right course of action, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not productive or helpful and will not bring the Palestinians any closer to statehood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the speech the President is giving is going to be a jobs speech, not a deficit/debt speech, correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is correct, but I will make it clear that he will make clear in his speech that the package of proposals he will put forward will be paid for, that he will pay for them within the package, and he will also put it within the context of his broader vision for economic growth and making America competitive in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And part of that will be the need to aggressively deal with our deficits and long-term debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When other folks were talking about scaling back, the President very clearly pushed hard for a substantial deficit and debt reduction package with the Speaker of the House this summer.\xc2\xa0 He continues to believe that we need to take on those issues, do it in a balanced way, do it in a way that will set us on a path for long-term deficit reduction, long-term stability in the relationship between our debt and GDP, and that that will have long-term positive effects on our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to go back to your question, yes, this will be primarily focused on the short-term need to take measures to grow the economy and create jobs, which is what the current economic situation calls for.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly what the American people want to see happen.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that the initiatives he\xe2\x80\x99ll put forward should have bipartisan support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he still intend to come forward with a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- specific plan to submit to the super committee?\xc2\xa0 And if so, any idea as to what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As promised, the President will provide the super committee -- Congress in general -- with his very specific ideas for the actions that they should take to achieve significant deficit reduction, significant long-term debt control.\xc2\xa0 And that commitment still stands, and it will come in relatively short order.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker wrote to the President today asking -- saying it would be appropriate for the President to brief the senior leadership in advance of the speech.\xc2\xa0 And Senator DeMint, on the Senate side, says that he\xe2\x80\x99s not sure he\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to come to this; he thought if the President would give Congress a package and then take the speech to explain it that it would be worth their time to come.\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to share some of this information with Congress before he delivers the speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements on specific phone calls or consultations he\xe2\x80\x99ll have prior to the speech.\xc2\xa0 As I think I noted early on in response to a related question, the President has clearly spent a great deal of time consulting with and discussing economic ideas with the Republican leadership and the Democratic leadership this year.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, going forward, both on jobs and growth as well as on deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, in terms of your question -- I think it was a question about those who might not attend the speech -- we think that\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable.\xc2\xa0 The President will -- is addressing Congress precisely because he believes it is urgent for this administration and Congress to act together to do what the American people are demanding Washington do, which is take action on the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He would consider it a snub?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- somebody asked me the other day when a House member said that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to attend because it\xe2\x80\x99s political -- what\xe2\x80\x99s political is the decision not to attend.\xc2\xa0 The President is addressing a joint session of Congress to talk about the economy, the American economy -- the need to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a goal shared by Republicans of all political persuasions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The White House has talked about how the President will be putting forward a jobs package that enjoys -- should enjoy some level of bipartisan support, ideas that Republicans have supported in the past.\xc2\xa0 At this stage in his presidency, is the President willing to put forward a package that reflects what he thinks is best for the country and what Democrats feel might be best for the country, or is he not at that place?\xc2\xa0 Does he only want to, at this point, put forward ideas that Republicans might conceivably sign on to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will put forward a package of ideas that, judged by outside analysts, would have a direct and immediate impact on the economy -- positive -- growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 It will be an array of ideas -- it will contain an array of ideas that address certain areas of the economy and that will have, again, a positive impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that these ideas should have, because they have had, bipartisan support does not take away from the fact that these are his ideas and his proposals.\xc2\xa0 He thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re the best ideas and the best proposals.\xc2\xa0 He wants them to get done, and he will call on Congress to act, and act now -- act right away to get them done. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s calling on Congress to put country before party, country before politics, and that within it contains the obvious point that the proposals he puts forward are just that:\xc2\xa0 They are measures that should have bipartisan support, have had bipartisan support and represent very much that idea that you need to put country before party.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not trimming his proposals, given the political realities in Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His proposals represent a package of ideas that he believes is the best possible package for the task at hand, which is to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carrie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear on your response to Ann\xe2\x80\x99s question about the meeting that the Speaker and Majority Leader requested, is that something that the President is entertaining or would do, in terms of consulting with them before --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement on a meeting or other forms of consultation.\xc2\xa0 I think if that is something I have to announce for you tomorrow or at another time, I will.\xc2\xa0 I think the broader point I was making is that there has been no shortage of consultations and meetings between this President and leaders in Congress of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And my guess is there will be meetings in the future on these very urgent matters of economic growth, job creation, deficit and debt reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My other point was that, in crafting a proposal, he -- that is very clearly, and you will see it as such, bipartisan in nature in terms of the ideas within it -- he looks forward to Congress judging it on its merits and taking action accordingly.\xc2\xa0 And you all will judge it, too, when you see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will this be a package that is a scorable package by CBO standards?\xc2\xa0 Will it have a dollar figure that he puts on it on Thursday night?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about metrics, which is -- it will create this many jobs or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to the outside experts to judge.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said I think repeatedly, we feel confident that because of the nature of the measures put forward, that they will be viewed by outside economists as having, if passed, a positive impact of the kind that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the relationship and the understanding of the White House between the European crisis and the American crisis.\xc2\xa0 Here very often, after readouts of the quotes of the President as he discusses the European crisis and what it has in consequence for the American side -- I really very -- not very often hear about what a problem the American financial crisis is for European markets.\xc2\xa0 So what is the understanding of the White House?\xc2\xa0 Which is a bigger problem?\xc2\xa0 Or are they on the same level -- mutual influences, bad influences at the moment for the turmoil in the markets?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to the Treasury Department for that kind of analysis, in terms of which has more of an impact on the global economy, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your question -- the situation in Europe or the situation here.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is, going back to my previous answers, that this President is focused on -- in addition to the consultations he has with his European counterparts, that he and Secretary Geithner have and others, he is focused on the actions that he can take, and that he working with Congress can take, to have a positive impact on the American economy and on the American job picture.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do that.\xc2\xa0 We need to do it urgently, even as we contend with some of these other issues that affect our economy that either we have limited control over or no control over, like the effect that the Arab uprisings had on oil prices or the effect that the earthquake and tsunami had on the economy because of disrupted supply chains.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michael.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a view on whether a temporary tax holiday for the repatriation of foreign corporate profits would be stimulative to the economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details of things beyond the ones that he\xe2\x80\x99s already discussed.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the economic analysis of that, I\xe2\x80\x99d maybe send you to Treasury or somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear on what you were previously talking about, the pay-fors for what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to propose Thursday night will be specified Thursday night, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be -- it won\xe2\x80\x99t be like, oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give a speech later where I will explain how I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pay for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he will make clear that there are pay-fors for the jobs and growth package that he\xe2\x80\x99s putting forward.\xc2\xa0 He will also --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there will be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know in terms of the lines in the speech, but he will make it clear and there will be supporting information for that.\xc2\xa0 But it will be within the context of his broader proposals for broader deficit reduction and debt control.\xc2\xa0 And as I think I mentioned earlier, it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because he has had a vision for a long time now of significant, sweeping deficit and debt reduction.\xc2\xa0 And because of the need to pay for the measures we need to take now to grow the economy and create jobs, he will call on the super committee to overshoot its target, to go beyond the $1.5 trillion called for by the legislation that created the committee and do more deficit reduction, more debt control.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the President said that if Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t act, he won\xe2\x80\x99t wait for them.\xc2\xa0 What did he mean by that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He will make the case that -- to the American people and to Congress that we need to act now.\xc2\xa0 He believes Congress can and will act, that there are measures -- that the measures he will put forward on Thursday should have and hopefully will have bipartisan support because of the urgency that members of Congress will feel returning from their recesses, having heard from their constituencies -- their constituents about the need to create jobs and grow the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If action isn\xe2\x80\x99t taken, he will continue to make that case because he hopes that eventually members of Congress -- if that happens, he will hope that eventually members of Congress will begin to feel the pressure from their constituents to set aside political posturing, set aside the ideological battles, and focus on the things we can and should do to address the immediate need to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way back -- yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about reports that the Chinese may have violated international sanctions by dealing with arms sales to the Qaddafi regime when he was in power in Libya?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to reports about intelligence material that was gathered in Tripoli.\xc2\xa0 I saw those reports; I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to them.\xc2\xa0 I can take your question if you want to address it to the office later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Goyal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, U.S.-India -- when President was in Mumbai and spoke with the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, and also they came to agreement that thousands of jobs will be created in the United States because of U.S.-India business relations -- when the President spoke to the U.S.-India Business Council.\xc2\xa0 One, what happened to those jobs, particularly over here, because that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to help U.S. economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I follow the question entirely, but I think that the importance of our bilateral relations with India, our economic cooperations with India, cannot be overstated, for the sake of our economy and for India\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think that continues to be the case, and that a healthy bilateral relationship will mean more jobs here and more jobs there.\xc2\xa0 And I think that remains the case as much today as it was when the President visited.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as corruption is concerned around the globe, now U.S. has been asking Swiss banks and Swiss government to open more accountability as far as who\xe2\x80\x99s holding how much money in their accounts, in secret accounts.\xc2\xa0 Now, I hope the President was following as far as demonstrations going on in India for the last whole month against corruption and against Indian corrupt politicians who are holding billions of dollars in Swiss banks and around the globe.\xc2\xa0 Do you think President is worried, and he should be concerned about that maybe even the terrorists are holding secret accounts in Swiss banks, including, as I said, Indian corrupt politicians?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked a number of questions there.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all aware of the protests that you refer to.\xc2\xa0 On the matter of money in bank accounts abroad, I would refer you to the Treasury Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, all.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to announce tomorrow talking about immigration -- on Thursday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No more details, sorry. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 4:05 P.M.
