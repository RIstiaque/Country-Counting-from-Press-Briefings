GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Kuhnhenn, take us away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 We had a little House Democratic action today, and in the wake of that, the Speaker said that the tax plan would not come to the floor unless it was \xe2\x80\x9cimproved,\xe2\x80\x9d her word.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, what does the President think of that kind of repudiation from the Democrats?\xc2\xa0 And what can you possibly do to the tax plan to make it more appealing to Democrats?\xc2\xa0 Can you just tweak it around the edges, things like energy tax credits and so on, or can you actually go after the estate tax and make any adjustments to that that would appeal to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say, first and foremost, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President over the past several days, he understands that there are parts of the agreement that Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one of them.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the upper-income tax rate changes, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the additional changes to the estate tax, there are certainly parts of this that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xc2\xa0 So that, by the nature of it, is compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf there are ways to strengthen the framework that are agreeable to everybody and strengthen the coalition, that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99d have to hear -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that House Democrats are going to have to talk about in terms of what they want to do and what they want to see. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI mean, obviously, as I said yesterday in response to several questions, if everybody took out what they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we would have nothing.\xc2\xa0 And we know the consequences of doing nothing, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I strongly believe and the White House strongly believes that at the end of the day, Congress will give the American people a vote on a plan that prevents their taxes from going up by several thousand dollars at the beginning of the year; that will prevent millions from losing their unemployment insurance; and as this agreement does, the framework of this agreement, give strong incentives for job creation and economic growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the estate tax, for instance -- which is the one thing that they have -- seem to be zeroing in on -- is that essentially off the table as a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jim, I think that -- I think that -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President is no big fan of.\xc2\xa0 I guess the question for them to work through with some of their Republican counterparts is if you do that, do you lose votes on the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo this is a -- this is a game of calculus and physics, and I think the bottom line, though, is that we will have a vote that will not result in people\xe2\x80\x99s taxes going up by the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Erskine Bowles yesterday complained that the plan didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any provisions for midterm or long-term deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And given how expensive it is, should that have been something -- is that fair criticism?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a few things.\xc2\xa0 One, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, the commission had a payroll tax cut in their proposal.\xc2\xa0 Two, this is not a long-term -- this is not a -- by definition, a long-term plan.\xc2\xa0 This is an agreement to -- basically tax policy for the next two years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJack Lew and Secretary Geithner met at the White House this morning with members of the fiscal commission to go through and discuss with them their report and to talk with them as we begin to broach and work through the decisions that we have for our budget for next year.\xc2\xa0 But I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to, over the next year and several years, have to have a discussion about getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President appointed the commission to begin with and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking through their proposals as we put our budget together to see what matches up and we could send to Capitol Hill early next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut I think it would be wrong to look at the agreement that the President laid down as either a long-term tax or a long-term budget agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the White House concerned about the reaction in bond markets, by the reaction that mortgage rates are going up as a result of this deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would you point you to somebody at Treasury.\xc2\xa0 I only get in trouble when I talk about things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even the mortgage rates bit?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the idea is you would like to help Americans, you would like to spur the economy with this deal, but one of the unintended consequences is mortgage rates going up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I will have 15 emails that have gotten me in trouble if I dip my toe into this swirling Rubicon, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, let me try something else then.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen cost estimates ranging from $700 billion to $1 trillion for this deal.\xc2\xa0 And Larry Summers talked about some of the cost estimates, particular aspects of it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have an overall price tag?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- and I should mention this when I was talking about Jim\xe2\x80\x99s answer -- within the extenders portion of the agreement, there are still some details to be worked through, and staff has been doing that over the past couple of days -- at what level, at what rate, the specifics of some those extenders.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know the exact cost of the bill, as Larry said yesterday, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll do an estimate on that as this goes through the legislative process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI have seen various estimates.\xc2\xa0 I think somewhere in the mid-seven -- upper-700s to upper-800s is probably about the right venue.\xc2\xa0 I think more than a third of that -- or about a third of that would be tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The next biggest expenditure, I believe, in the composition of the total is the payroll tax cut. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo those comprise the largest elements, percentage-wise, in the package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us -- last question --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you said the payroll tax cut was paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 When did I say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other day when we were talking about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, this is -- no, this is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I said that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just going to ask one last follow-up on the Lew meeting -- the Lew and Geithner meeting.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us any more about what particular issues they discussed and what the reaction is from --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jack and his team are in the midst of putting together a budget.\xc2\xa0 There are meetings -- there have been meetings on that this week, and later in the day, on decisions that have to be made around that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think one of the -- obviously, not simply talking through just the specifics of what they talked about, but I think also you can get a sense from discussing with the commission members sort of the different types of coalitions that you might be able to put together to get some of this through law -- through Congress and into law, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- certainly the panel is made up of members of Congress and this all has to get through them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJake. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Speaker Pelosi is actually talking about not even introducing this bill for a vote, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen and all the economic catastrophe that you guys are warning about is going to happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think at the end of the day, this will get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think she\xe2\x80\x99s bluffing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that this is a long and winding process.\xc2\xa0 But I think at the end of the day, members are not going to want to be in their districts, senators are not going to want to be in their districts when their constituents find out on the 1st of January that their taxes have gone up by several thousand dollars. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I continue to believe that when all is said and done, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get something done this year, everyone will I think rightly be blamed for not having gotten something done and we\xe2\x80\x99ll find ourselves, quite frankly, in a position where we\xe2\x80\x99re not getting the politics out of unemployment insurance for the rest of the year; a payroll tax that, I think safe to say, most economists, probably almost every economist that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work inside here, didn\xe2\x80\x99t think was even in the offing.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the basis for -- the basis for the economic projections that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen increased.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Considering -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President and other senior advisors on the record -- and then others off the record or on background -- express frustration or hint at frustration with Congress, with Democratic leaders.\xc2\xa0 President Obama pointed out the other day that he wanted a vote on this before the midterms, and obviously, the Democratic leaders didn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver.\xc2\xa0 David Axelrod yesterday pointed out that the House couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even pass seven months\xe2\x80\x99 worth of unemployment insurance extensions; this compromise would have 13 months.\xc2\xa0 How personally frustrated is President Obama with the Democratic leaders in Congress, considering how difficult they\xe2\x80\x99re making this process for him in a deal that he feels is ultimately the only thing he could have gotten?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President is -- and the Vice President has certainly been up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President was pleased, even after the caucus last night, that members came up to him -- he told me this -- members came up to him agreeing that this was a good agreement.\xc2\xa0 But --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then they voted not to support it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it was a voice vote, and my guess is if a lot of voices yell one thing you may not yell the other.\xc2\xa0 But I think that -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we spend a lot of time here thinking about what could have been in September or in October or things like that.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on an agreement that he thinks provides some genuine economic growth and job creation potential and to ensure that taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up -- even as we understand rightly the frustration of those that this agreement includes stuff that the President has campaigned against, the President has fought against, the President has said over and over again that he opposes.\xc2\xa0 It is that part that makes it compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd, again, I think in the end of the day the President is -- believes that this agreement, the framework we have, will be the basis for what prevents middle-class tax rates from going up on the 1st of January. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just put a button on this.\xc2\xa0 Have Speaker Pelosi or Leader Reid offered an alternative deal that could get through the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But I would direct you to them.\xc2\xa0 Not that I have heard, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go back on the estate tax?\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of prominent Democrats, including Congressman Clyburn, who really saw this as pouring salt on their wounds, that this was something that took them by surprise and was an unnecessary gift to the rich, in their perspective.\xc2\xa0 Is the President not willing at all to amend his position on that, perhaps take the estate tax back to the 2009 level that many Democrats --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What was the 2009 -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forty-five percent with a $3.5 million --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Three point five --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three point five percent -- $3.5 million at 45 percent<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a $46 billion two-year price tag, as I understand it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, do I -- does the President wish we had to add $12 billion each year for two years to go to the different level?\xc2\xa0 No, as you heard him say. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat was and has been the negotiating position of the Republican Party since the very beginning, including the meeting that was held in the Roosevelt Room.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they offered as their -- that was their position on the estate tax.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, there are parts in this we don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s parts in this I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xc2\xa0 The reason why you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get an extension of unemployment insurance through the House wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because most Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t think that you should extend unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because Republicans didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe you should.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so there\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s things in here that none of us find -- or not all of us find attractive.\xc2\xa0 But in order to get something that a majority can agree on, I think the basis and the framework for that is encompassed in this agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are several Democratic lawmakers who did not agree -- did not feel that this meeting with the Vice President went well, and they believed that the administration --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, compromise.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they believed that the administration presented it as a take-it-or-leave-it deal.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the President is presenting this as a take-it-or-leave-it kind of deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I said yesterday and I said earlier to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, and that is if there are ways that this agreement can be strengthened, that everybody signs -- everybody believes in -- but understand, again, if one side takes out what they don\xe2\x80\x99t like and the other side takes out what they don\xe2\x80\x99t like, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have that.\xc2\xa0 And that, a blank piece of paper, is not going to prevent middle-class tax rates from going up.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to prevent\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to prevent the politics that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get played every three months for all of 2011, with extending unemployment insurance, even to the tune of watching the benefits of 2 million people expire before Christmas, before the end of the year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, a perfect deal?\xc2\xa0 Not by any means.\xc2\xa0 Are there things in it the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like?\xc2\xa0 Some of them in here are things I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him be opposed to for as long as I have been with him, and that goes back to April of 2004.\xc2\xa0 But the nature of compromise is taking enough things to get an agreement through.\xc2\xa0 And I think in the end we will. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President need to go to the Hill to make his case personally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President -- the President has been making his case, and the President will continue to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have another dead horse to beat.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Be careful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t preface the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You have to admit, it was pretty good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The surgeon general this morning told one of our correspondents when asked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s smoking habits, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is working very hard to stop.\xc2\xa0 He has been working very hard at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So my question is, how hard has he been working at it?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen or witnessed evidence of any smoking in probably nine months. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know that he\xe2\x80\x99s working at it?\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to you about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he saying?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is -- this is not -- I mean, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say this -- this is not something that he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of.\xc2\xa0 He knows that it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for him.\xc2\xa0 He knows that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like children to know about it, obviously, including his.\xc2\xa0 And I think he has worked extremely hard.\xc2\xa0 And I think he would tell you, even when in the midst of a tax agreement and a START deal and all the other things that accumulate, that even where he might have once found some comfort in that, he\xe2\x80\x99s pushed it away.\xc2\xa0 So he understands its dangers and I think has done a lot of extraordinary work to wrestle with that habit, as millions of Americans have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Now, changing horses, does the fact that the Senate may do a test vote on the tax package raise your hopes that that will force the House\xe2\x80\x99s hand?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it will demonstrate that there is support for this agreement in both parties.\xc2\xa0 I think you have, largely because we have barraged you with them, statements from elected officials all over the country -- mayors, governors, governors-elect -- from big cities, smaller cities, big states, smaller states that believe, as the President does, that we have to do several things:\xc2\xa0 ensure that taxes for the middle-class don\xe2\x80\x99t go up; ensure that we get an extension of unemployment benefits; and ensures that we get some real economic bang for our buck in something like the payroll tax.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I think it will obviously legislatively bring us one step closer to getting this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And I think, in the end, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get something done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A number of op-eds today suggesting this compromise is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 And yet there are officials who say that some of the elements of it are things that simply wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have worked in \xe2\x80\x9809 when the Republicans wanted the stimulus package to be predominantly tax cuts and not spending.\xc2\xa0 So, which is it?\xc2\xa0 Or is it a combination of both?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the second part of your question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The tax cuts that -- Republicans wanted the \xe2\x80\x9809 stimulus package to be mostly tax cuts, not federal spending. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The truth is, I think in terms of -- well, we can always quibble.\xc2\xa0 I think a decent number of -- a decent number -- several hundred billion dollars, probably more than a third of the bill, was tax cuts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they wanted more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want more enough to vote for it, because they all support an AMT tax relief and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They wanted more tax cuts than spending, that was their position.\xc2\xa0 The school of thought then was that the economy was in such bad shape that the tax cuts themselves wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do the job.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be answering your question for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think fairly well -- fairly well borne out by history, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how much of this deal reflects the President looking at the midterm elections, saying, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to compromise with Republicans, and how much of it reflects the economy\xe2\x80\x99s growth from \xe2\x80\x9809 to now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- look, I think what the election brought to Washington was -- and what the imminent change in our calendar brings is the notion that to get anything done by the end of the year it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be all of what anybody wants.\xc2\xa0 And we know that because we had -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in the position of working through an agreement because on Saturday we had two votes in the Senate that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough to move this process along.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at this because we\xe2\x80\x99re at a legislative stalemate in just what -- just the option that we wanted, which was to make the middle-class tax cuts permanent. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn designing an agreement, obviously we wanted something that -- we wanted something that made sense economically.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and I think maybe compromise is a good word to describe, for instance, taking $60 billion in -- roughly $60 billion in Make Work Pay for 2011 and 2012, putting it together in 2011 and doing it through a payroll tax cut which shares a number of the characteristics to Make Work Pay, doing it with a greater bang for your buck means the benefit to the middle class is greater for virtually every family under $106,000 or roughly $107,000.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think it is an understanding that the only way we were going to get something done after the votes on Saturday was to work together, and in doing so, we wanted something that provided economic certainty and grew the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we looking at the calendar here or are we looking at a new President Obama?\xc2\xa0 Is this a move toward the center?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you want me to say triangulate?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you feel you\xe2\x80\x99d like.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see the same kind of compromise in 2011?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this.\xc2\xa0 We have -- if you look at what -- the President took, as he talked to you all about -- we took a pretty bad press day in Seoul, Korea, to walk away from an agreement that we believed wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as good as we could get.\xc2\xa0 And we got something that ended up being better for our country and for our country\xe2\x80\x99s workers, and because of that, put together a coalition that I think stands a better chance of getting through Congress, because Dave Camp and Sandy Levin and Ford and the United Auto Workers are supportive of that newer deal.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a coalition that can get a trade agreement through Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think START is going to pass by the end of this year with a pretty big bipartisan vote.\xc2\xa0 And I think in the end this will pass with a bipartisan vote as well.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is what the American people asked for in this election, and I hope it is a sign of things to come.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this compromise, this time of compromise is or is not likely to be what we\xe2\x80\x99ll see over the next couple of years?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President is certainly hopeful that we can get into a room and discuss issues like adults and come out with an agreement that while we might not all like is in the best interests of the American people in this.\xc2\xa0 In this tax agreement, it\xe2\x80\x99s to preserve the middle class -- to preserve middle-class families from seeing a tax increase.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s animated the President and hopefully that\xe2\x80\x99s what will bring us an agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the six-pack group of folks that were negotiating the tax bill, they stopped meeting as a group formally I think it was the Friday before the Senate held those votes that didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xc2\xa0 And then you guys announced a deal.\xc2\xa0 Did you cut out the House Democrats too quickly?\xc2\xa0 Did you not bring them in on the loop?\xc2\xa0 That seems to be the common complaint among this House Democratic caucus, is that you guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t loop them in on the negotiations enough.\xc2\xa0 Did you guys make a mistake?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go back and look through the scheduling of when each of these meetings was done.\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think that the frustration of -- there\xe2\x80\x99s understandable frustration about what is in this agreement --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they felt uninformed.\xc2\xa0 They saw the -- basically the agreement came out and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- and a lot of House Democrats felt as if they were out of the loop.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d push back on that a bit because we had the leaders of the House and the Senate down here a couple of times -- I believe once over the weekend, maybe more than once over the weekend, and then on Monday before the President went out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They weren\xe2\x80\x99t there -- when you were cutting a deal with McConnell and Boehner, was Speaker Pelosi in the room?\xc2\xa0 Was Chris Van Hollen in the room?\xc2\xa0 This is part of a negotiation --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who was in every meeting, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Again, we -- I think the President -- I think the President believes -- continues to believe we got a good deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Elijah Cummings implied today that START and the estate tax are connected in the negotiations with Senator Kyl.\xc2\xa0 What do you respond to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think a number of us have continued to say that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What gives you the confidence that you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a START vote, since we\xe2\x80\x99re now less than a week before -- we\xe2\x80\x99re less than a week away -- about a week away before the official recess?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99d make a ton of plans in that intervening week.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all aware of that.\xc2\xa0 But you still have --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry to do the -- sorry to deliver coal in the occasional stocking, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You still have Mitch McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s word that you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a vote?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have his word?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a vote for a number of reasons, not the least of which it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 I will say -- going back to Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question -- when was the last thing we proposed that the last five Republican -- last six Republican secretaries of state thought was a good idea that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the vast support of the American people like START does?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for our relationship with Russia and our relationships in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do to cut our deployed nuclear stockpiles.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it will get done because of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today the Transportation Department is pulling money from Wisconsin and Ohio for light rail and redirecting this money, stimulus money, to other states.\xc2\xa0 Both Wisconsin and Ohio just elected Republican governors who ran in part on pledging not to -- they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go through that project.\xc2\xa0 Why not let them use that money for other transportation projects?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because the money is written into the law to be for high-speed rail.\xc2\xa0 Both gubernatorial candidates, now both gubernatorial -- or governors-elect, told us they weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to spend that money as the law is written.\xc2\xa0 And as you know -- and I think your network and many others have done stories on ensuring that we spend this money the right way.\xc2\xa0 And if grants that are obligated to places that aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to use them as the law intends, then we will give that money to places that will use it as the law intends.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Considering the pain that Wisconsin and Ohio have in their own economy, and the point of this money was to pump money into some of these states, particularly those two states, would you be open to changing the law so that money could be used for other transportation projects?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, Chuck, that building high-speed rail would alleviate the very problems that you just described.\xc2\xa0 Now, you can ask governors-elect whether they decided not to put people in their own state to work just because Barack Obama decided that -- or just because Barack Obama proposed it as a project.\xc2\xa0 My hunch is that there are people sitting around their kitchen tables in Ohio and Wisconsin who are wondering why they\xe2\x80\x99re not at work because a partisan political food fight by a governor-elect.\xc2\xa0 Those people could be at work if they spent the money as it was legally intended to be spent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This question about START, about whether there was a START connection, you\xe2\x80\x99re treating that like some kind of nefarious thing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly standard procedure, especially when you\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating with the Senate to try to get some kind of more universal or broad floor agreement.\xc2\xa0 When you agree on one thing, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a vote on another.\xc2\xa0 Was there any effort to get anything from Mitch McConnell to assure, if not a START vote --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve written like three stories about the -- how we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to trade some of this for some of that and get some of this for some of that.\xc2\xa0 There just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we were working on an agreement on how taxes was going to be treated over the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did you get any -- try to get any assurances on Republican votes that if we do this, then the Republicans can deliver that many votes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I was not in each of these meetings.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think these are legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to stand on and be approved on its merits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d we\xe2\x80\x99ve now seen a number of Republicans in the Senate come forward in favor of it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some dispute on how that vote would take place procedurally, and I wonder what involvement the White House is having on that, resolving that, and whether you think that \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d could also be passed --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it can and I think, as you mentioned, Jonathan, there are a number of individual senators that have come out in support of ending an unjust policy.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, the President has made calls to Democrats and Republicans on both \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d and the DREAM Act.\xc2\xa0 I will check with Legislative Affairs if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that\xe2\x80\x99s going on, particularly to break the procedural logjam on the number of amendments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, quick follow-up to your response to Bill\xe2\x80\x99s question about the President smoking.\xc2\xa0 Should we take that to mean that he\xe2\x80\x99s quit?\xc2\xa0 You said you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any evidence or seen him smoking for nine months.\xc2\xa0 Has he quit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For that nine months, yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be flip.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the President would be the first one to tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s a struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how has he done it?\xc2\xa0 How did he do it?\xc2\xa0 Is it the gum?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s stubborn -- (laughter) -- and has -- look, this is something that he has thought about for awhile.\xc2\xa0 As I said, I think this is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s aware is not something that\xe2\x80\x99s in doing is in his best interest for his health.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99s thought about that for quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on something else.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to -- can we expect him to speak about or maybe even to Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As it relates to Liu Xiaobo, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, the President was among the very few who put out a statement both congratulating him and calling on China to release him.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- we will release a statement reiterating that tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That will be a written statement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the official U.S. representation at the ceremony?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the decision on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe our ambassador will be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What message does that send?\xc2\xa0 Some countries are boycotting it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re there in showing support for the committee\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 And we were the previous recipient of that prestigious award and the President and our ambassador strongly believe that they should be in attendance of a ceremony attended by the winner, because he\xe2\x80\x99s [not] been released by China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The heads of the deficit commission urged the President to call a budget summit early next year.\xc2\xa0 Will he do that?\xc2\xa0 And also, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he drop by the meeting this morning?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look through the schedule and see when it was versus -- I think the President may have been in the Export Council meeting when they met with Jack and Tim.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking through that and deciding what makes sense to put in the budget as we construct that for next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think a summit is worth considering, a budget summit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we ask the commission to do a lot of important work.\xc2\xa0 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a law through to set up a commission.\xc2\xa0 So the President believed, through executive order, that it was important to do that through his power.\xc2\xa0 And I think the process, particularly with the budget coming, the best process right now is to analyze, discuss and meet with the commission at the level that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it and see what can be included in the budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, what is the administration doing to reach out to the liberal base, who have been so critical of the compromise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you all have documented the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s attendance on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen quite a bit of staff up there.\xc2\xa0 There are discussions in this building with members.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has been out there campaigning quite a bit about why this is important to our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there specific administration officials who are reaching out to different liberal groups, though, behind the scenes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think if you look at some of the -- in terms of groups, I mean, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen folks like John Podesta and Bob Greenstein who have put out statements strongly in support of -- as those on the left -- put out statements strongly in support of this agreement.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s that.\xc2\xa0 I think Jack Lew and Gene Sperling were at both caucuses yesterday, separate of the Vice President, the Senate caucus yesterday, and then with him later when he met with the House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the smoking issue, he\xe2\x80\x99s not on any gum, is he?\xc2\xa0 Because I know at one point he was chewing a gum or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s still chewing gum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s still chewing the gum, okay.\xc2\xa0 Then on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d if the efforts to move this forward fail, what is the President prepared to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think our efforts right now are focused on, as we have always said, what we believe is the best and most durable solution -- that is one through Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where our efforts are directed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that Secretary Gates worked through, with the military, the study and -- the attitudinal study of our men and women in the armed forces.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no better advocate in that than Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen in believing how much this needs to get done this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think the President strongly believes that one of two things is going to happen.\xc2\xa0 Either Congress is going to solve this legislatively or the courts are going to decide this.\xc2\xa0 And the policy is going to come to an end.\xc2\xa0 Congress has to ask themselves how they want to end it and how -- what role they want to play in ensuring that it\xe2\x80\x99s done in an orderly way. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, first of all, just checking today, have there been any phone calls by the President to members about the tax cut deal or any one of them --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will double-check.\xc2\xa0 I have -- I\xe2\x80\x99m behind on my email, so I should check on that before I say yes or no, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do some checking on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also, both in the statement from the co-chairman of the fiscal commission and in the members\xe2\x80\x99 comments to Jack Lew and Tim Geithner today, they urged the President not just to have a budget summit with congressional Republicans but to put in his budget and in his State of the Union speech a call for his own debt reduction plan.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that part of the purpose of the Cabinet meeting yesterday was to let Cabinet officials know that there were going to be some tough decisions and some tough cuts that were going to have to be made.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the President make a decision that -- to freeze federal pay -- to freeze pay for federal workers.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are a number of very tough decisions that are coming that are going to have to be made to get our fiscal house in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he put a number on it to the Cabinet officials?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I missed most of the meeting, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I assume that they are working off some numbers.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President said any in that meeting directly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will he call for -- will he have his own debt reduction plan early in the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we -- look, we have a budget that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the scale -- comprehensive and on the scale of the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of where they are in terms of budgetary decisions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a budget process we have had since we got here to cut the budget deficit in half over a four-year period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the President is going to meet Admiral Mullen this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say that again?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to meet Admiral Mullen this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could you give us some detail about that?\xc2\xa0 And also, is North Korea still on the top of agenda in the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I can probably combine those two.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Admiral is just back from a trip to the Republic of Korea.\xc2\xa0 And we have had -- National Security Advisor Tom Donilon has had Korean and Japanese officials here to discuss North Korea and -- along with Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 And there will be additional trips to Beijing by senior administration officials to reiterate our call that the Chinese be clear with the North Koreans about their belligerent behavior and its destabilizing effect on the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also -- sorry, Admiral Mullen said that he hopes Secretary Gates visit next month to China could strengthen both sides\xe2\x80\x99 military relations.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the expectation of the administration about Secretary Gates visit to China?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think whether it is -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s folks like Jeff Bader or Jim Steinberg or, as you mentioned next month, Secretary Gates, I think our message is, as I just said it, and that is China is in a position to have strong influence over the actions and the behavior of the North Koreans, and it is our belief that they should use their influence in that country to stabilize the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 When the President made his announcement about the tax deal on Tuesday, he did not have legislative language in front of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any talk with the White House specifically about the numbers within the estate tax portion of it that would change or narrow the numbers that were at least in the fact sheets that the White House gave out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, this was -- this is not something that we have found -- this is not something that we were the champions of.\xc2\xa0 This is not something that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did it get in there?\xc2\xa0 Did it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How did it get in there?\xc2\xa0 It got in there because this is what the Republicans said was the price of coming along for extending tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 When the President stood up here and said we\xe2\x80\x99re for -- our goal is to protect the middle class and their goal is to protect the very wealthy, I would -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty safe to call that Exhibit A in that argument. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, as both Jonathan and Suzanne talked about, the 2009 level was a $3.5 million exemption and a 45 percent rate on estates that exceeded that individual level.\xc2\xa0 This is a $5 million exemption and a 35 percent rate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, would we prefer a different rate?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Again, there are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why compromise is never easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you look at the prospect of both some senators and some House members saying there really have to be some changes in this to -- for me to support it, does the President see a risk in opening up any of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what is the risk?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, as I -- I will go back to what I said yesterday, and that is, look, when you start --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you weren\xe2\x80\x99t on camera.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that my tie and this suit definitely will change this answer, but we have -- I mean, obviously I think it goes without saying that if you start to unpack this deal significantly, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find ourselves sort of where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been for several months, and that is at a stalemate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think, again, understand why we are here.\xc2\xa0 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a piece of legislation that went through the House, through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we are -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it requires that we take some of what we may not like and some of what we may not be a strong supporter of in order to get enough people along that can get something done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think if all we could do is this with -- by our own choice and by writing all the rules and what have you, I hear people talk about that.\xc2\xa0 We tried that.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t get through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still take it or leave it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, as I said earlier, if somebody can figure out how to get -- to make the agreement better for everybody, as Bob Barker would say, come on down.\xc2\xa0 Nobody would walk away from that.\xc2\xa0 I guess it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Bob who said that.\xc2\xa0 It was the guy who --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, it was?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cPrice is Right\xe2\x80\x9d --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be the other guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was the announcer, technically, who -- no, but I mean, but seriously -- but no, no -- but, again,<br/>\n\tlook, again, the example I used earlier, if you -- if one side takes what the other side -- if one side takes out what they don\xe2\x80\x99t like, my hunch is that that\xe2\x80\x99s what the other side likes and they\xe2\x80\x99ll take out what they don\xe2\x80\x99t like and then we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question is, is that happening right now?\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing, is some of that give and take --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said earlier to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s I think first question, or somebody along the beginning here, is there are extenders -- what we had is a rough figure of extenders that I think is still being worked -- the details of which are being worked through.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an aggressive effort on the part of the White House to pass this package.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing daily emails from the White House, very public individuals who are supporting this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You guys haven\xe2\x80\x99t learned so many mayors\xe2\x80\x99 names in the last 24 hours as -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a quiz, I\xe2\x80\x99m just warning you, at the end of this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s Charlotte Mayor -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to figure out -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This feels, Robert, this feels a little different from what we saw over the last two years.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I remember anything quite so concerted and aggressive as this.\xc2\xa0 Is this a model for what we might see going forward?\xc2\xa0 Is this a new approach on the part of the White House to sort of build support and consensus behind what it wants to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important to -- I think it is important to understand that, again, while there are differences and while there are those that have and will continue to express their concerns, I do think it is important to understand that the mayor of L.A. has a number of constituents; the governor-elect of New York and the mayor of New York represent a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we understand that there are even members in the House and Senate that they don\xe2\x80\x99t always get on cable TV but they\xe2\x80\x99re there.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that people understood that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Plus we have free email.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the President has quit smoking.\xc2\xa0 Anyone else in the White House that you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of who has taken up smoking?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Under the law of conservation of matter that if one thing ends, another -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has anyone taken up smoking to cope with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent -- wow, I think I can say this, too -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Marvin Nicholson, who has smoked as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve known him, he has also quit smoking.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s broken out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they started gaining weight?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I go on background as a senior administration official?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Marvin, I had to -- I think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of anybody that has started smoking, not that it -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make a joke about that.\xc2\xa0 Lord knows.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just had a follow-up to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s earlier question.\xc2\xa0 Are all these emails and letters from various elected officials intended to pressure elected officials in Congress to come out to support the bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re intended -- honestly, they\xe2\x80\x99re intended to show that this is an agreement that has strong bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, real quick about -- Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to the Senate asking them not to include a provision banning Guantanamo Bay prisoners from coming to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Will the President sign a continuing resolution that has a provision like that in it? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we would evaluate -- the answer to that, we would -- obviously you saw the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s letter consistent with administration policy, and has been for quite some time, before we would make any decisions about signing that after it\xe2\x80\x99s been through the legislative process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the tax issue, the Democratic caucus is using the words like they -- like revolt.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying they\xe2\x80\x99re revolting against this administration for what they\xe2\x80\x99re calling a bridge too far.\xc2\xa0 Using your Bob Barker analogy, they\xe2\x80\x99re saying the price is not right, because --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was pretty good.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you that.\xc2\xa0 That was good. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Rod Roddy, is the guy\xe2\x80\x99s name.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, look at what he did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somebody fact-checked it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, good, okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, anyway --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d think Rod Roddy would be a name we could remember.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 All right, well, okay, going back to the price is not right, they\xe2\x80\x99re saying with this bridge too far on the estate tax, you would have to borrow $68 billion from China to give 32,000 families a relief with this tax.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, this is not something that -- this is not his idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut I do think, just in a series of fairness, the 2009 level, the exemption of $3.5 million at 45 percent is not cost free.\xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not great at math, but I think the overall estate tax component is probably in the $70 billion -- probably about a $70 billion expenditure.\xc2\xa0 Two-thirds of that -- two-thirds of that is the 2009 level -- the $3.5 million exemption at a 45 percent rate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBecause understand now if you simply extended the estate tax where it is now, it\xe2\x80\x99s zero.\xc2\xa0 No rate, no exemption.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re free to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even -- you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even talk about hen you talk about couples in 2009 at 7 percent and then now it\xe2\x80\x99s 10 percent -- I mean, $10 million -- excuse me --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, no, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s an individual exemption.\xc2\xa0 And obviously if you have -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re married and you have an estate, that\xe2\x80\x99s an individual -- the $5 million is an individual exemption.\xc2\xa0 The rate obviously holds.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re a family it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously double that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And now also on two other issues.\xc2\xa0 How is this administration promoting a credible election in Haiti with all the violence and uprising --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a statement on Haiti.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with smoking, many people say it could be linked to pressure or it could be something to relax -- relax a person.\xc2\xa0 What did you see the President do -- what was the timeframe?\xc2\xa0 How did it happen?\xc2\xa0 What was he involved in at that time when he was smoking, you last saw him smoking nine months ago?\xc2\xa0 What was the issue?\xc2\xa0 Was he having fun?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last time -- I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the individual setting.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I would disagree -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I would disagree -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a smoker, but I think if you asked him he would likely say that for both -- and again, I hesitate to do this on camera, just in terms -- for both -- for enjoyment and for some relaxation from the pressure that you mention.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, I hate to do this because if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in the world that I hope my son never, ever, ever, ever does, is this.\xc2\xa0 And his grandfather was a smoker until a doctor told him that he had lung cancer.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s still here, and hopefully will be for a long time.\xc2\xa0 But -- I was told that by my dad at the end of my son\xe2\x80\x99s third or fourth birthday party.\xc2\xa0 So it is -- I think the President understands that it is a -- as I said, this is not something that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99s greatly struggled with and not something that he\xe2\x80\x99s altogether proud of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, tax bills are famous for a lot of deals, a lot of lobbyists getting things tucked in at the last minute, a lot of horse trading.\xc2\xa0 Will all the transparency rules apply?\xc2\xa0 Will you post this on the Internet?\xc2\xa0 Will the public have plenty of time to read the final language before it\xe2\x80\x99s signed into law?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard otherwise, so, yes.\xc2\xa0 I may have just made administration policy but what the heck, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the 9/11 health care bill finally came up for a vote today, was defeated, as I think was expectations after doing some vote counting.\xc2\xa0 White House statement on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get something for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously we have to do all that we can for those that put their lives in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way and who risked their health in order to save others on that day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow-up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The New York delegation has -- they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to see whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s workable to now attach this to the tax cut deal.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve got about 50 signatures, or about 50 supporters they claim at this point -- wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s anything that\xe2\x80\x99s on the White House radar screen.\xc2\xa0 Is that doable?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.\xc2\xa0 Let me check with Legislative Affairs on some of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve told us several times that -- on the Middle East -- that a freeze on the settlements was at least one of the essential building blocks to successful peace talks in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 And it sort of got lost this week, and nobody has asked about it, but the United States dropped its demand that Israel freeze its settlements in the Middle East -- on the West Bank.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, let\xe2\x80\x99s be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what happened?\xc2\xa0 What happened?\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear that -- let me -- I want to amend, if I can, your question.\xc2\xa0 Our administration policy on settlements is I think -- we have the same position as administrations have had for probably dating back to Johnson on that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs I said, I think at one point I was reading through some old transcripts and Reagan was asked about it at a -- on settlements.\xc2\xa0 This is back in like 1982, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a well-worn position of our government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe still believe that it is in the interest of both sides to seek a comprehensive peace.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to be engaged to get each of the sides to take the steps that are necessary to get back to direct talks and to make progress on a two-state solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhen the parties were here earlier in the year, we said this was going to require constant attention and constant effort.\xc2\xa0 We know that progress is almost impossible to make without our engagement, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be engaged in and continue to have -- work with the parties to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is a change in the position of the administration in terms of supporting the Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 belief that a freeze is the first step towards serious talks.\xc2\xa0 Is this just -- do you then at least admit that this is going to make it a lot more difficult to come to some agreement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, not being -- I think we continue to believe that -- let me just say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have each side take steps to build confidence in this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, if I missed this -- back on the tax stuff, if I missed this, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But from the White House perspective, what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 What do you do next?\xc2\xa0 I mean, Speaker Pelosi says she won\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up.\xc2\xa0 You say you\xe2\x80\x99re confident she will.\xc2\xa0 How do you square this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I said was I believe that at the end of the day -- maybe not today -- (laughter) -- but at the end of this, we will have a proposal that passes and the President signs that prevents middle-class families\xe2\x80\x99 taxes from going up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think the next step, as I understand it, is that the Senate will take this up.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one important step on this legislative highway.\xc2\xa0 And I think as you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen senators, they\xe2\x80\x99ve looked into this deal and analyzed this deal, they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen others\xe2\x80\x99 analysis of this deal, and I think more and more people have supported it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the deficit commission?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the tax side of the equation, they called for basically eliminating tax expenditures and slashing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Eliminating what?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the tax expenditures, to get rid of all of them and to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about loopholes and such?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And then lower tax rates as a result.\xc2\xa0 So do you see a big push for tax reform then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I have heard the President and others in the administration talk about tax reform.\xc2\xa0 I think it is something that the President would like to see us begin the process of, broadening -- cutting loopholes, broadening the base and lowering tax rates. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think it is important to understand that that is not a process that will happen overnight.\xc2\xa0 That will take -- as it did I think in the last major tax code revision in the mid \xe2\x80\x9880s -- that will take some time.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President and the team certainly believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s good to start that long process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d you mentioned earlier that the President sees this ending either legislatively or through the courts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the Congress before the Republicans take control of the House, is the President prepared to live with a legal resolution?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say Presidents are not often afforded a decision about whether they\xe2\x80\x99ll live with a legal resolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt is not -- look, I think the first thing that the Pentagon would tell you is it\xe2\x80\x99s not their preferred route.\xc2\xa0 Look, you saw a decent amount of confusion when the Ninth Circuit effectively ended -- well, not effectively -- legally ended \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There was some confusion about recruiting and how do you handle somebody who walks into a recruiter\xe2\x80\x99s office for a couple of days. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe belief of the President and I think importantly the belief of the Secretary of Defense and the Chair of the Joint Chiefs, not simply is the policy wrong and should be done away with, but doing this in a legislative way provides some transition period to implement the change.\xc2\xa0 The courts may not be as understanding as somebody in the legislature would be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd you could easily face a situation where because of a court ruling, the law of the land changes in an instant.\xc2\xa0 And the best way to prevent that -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s coming -- is to do this through legislation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had hearings.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had an exhaustive attitudinal study of the military.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s shown that ending this policy will not provide a significant disruption to our forces. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd for some frontline battlefield forces that might have a greater percentage of those who think it might be harder to do, you can have a transition period.\xc2\xa0 But the policy can and should end legislatively on Capitol Hill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it now or never in Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it is an important period of time, and I think we are closer than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been.\xc2\xa0 And I think more and more each day you see senators coming out -- the House has done this.\xc2\xa0 The House has taken that step.\xc2\xa0 I think every day you see senators coming out in support of its change, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re close. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is there any plans for the President or First Lady to attend the memorial service for Elizabeth Edwards?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with scheduling on that.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:55 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
