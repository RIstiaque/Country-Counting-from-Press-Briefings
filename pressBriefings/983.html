CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get out much, does he?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Was that -- that was a great event.\xc2\xa0 You know, April, it is -- I saw him right afterwards.\xc2\xa0 He loves this event, and he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s so important.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s just say that his remarks were -- went beyond what was on the printed page, because he feels -- he does feel so inspired by the kids and by the importance of science education and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 So when he gave his advice to your editors about giving prominence to this event, he meant it sincerely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The marshmallow did it, he got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 There were all sorts of fascinating things that those kids were working on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I hope you enjoyed the science fair event today at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President sure did.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I wanted to give you a readout of another moment of the President\xe2\x80\x99s day that the President enjoyed, which was this morning President Obama called New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin to congratulate him and the rest of the New York football Giants on their recent Super Bowl victory.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that the team\xe2\x80\x99s victory was a testament to Coach Coughlin\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and that his team demonstrated true grit and determination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama told Coach Coughlin that he looks forward to greeting him and congratulating the team in person when they come and visit the White House, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll all be here for that.\xc2\xa0 Probably even the Patriots fans among you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speak for yourself, Giants fan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not a Giants fan, but it was a fun game to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben Feller. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 On the decision -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give his approval to the Democratic super PAC, as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s on record as saying that these PACs and the way they allow money to drive elections are a threat to democracy; now he\xe2\x80\x99s given his stamp to exactly that kind of organization so that the Democratic PAC can keep pace with Republican ones.\xc2\xa0 And his campaign says basically these are the rules, and they stink, but if we want to compete, we got to play by them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess my point is, what is the point of taking a principled stand and campaigning against something if then you switch course and abandon it for the sake of strategy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, first of all, the President\xe2\x80\x99s views of the influence of the Citizens United decision haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 He strongly opposed it, as you know.\xc2\xa0 He made that clear at his State of the Union address in 2010, which got a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 And he holds those views today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He, just as recently as this weekend, discussed, as you mentioned, the fact that he wished that Washington was doing more to reduce the influence of money in politics.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, is that he has been committed to working with Congress to eliminate the corrosive influence of money in Washington, and he proposed new ideas along those lines in his State of the Union address, with regards to political reform in Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On his first day in office, the President issued an executive order with some of the toughest ethics rules ever imposed on the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 For the first time in history, the White House began posting visitor records online in accessible, searchable format for anyone to browse or download.\xc2\xa0 As of December 2011, over 2 million records were posted on the website.\xc2\xa0 And this is the first administration to prohibit executive branch employees from accepting gifts from registered lobbyists.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This administration has done more than any in history to prevent undue influence over the government by lobbyists, by moneyed interests.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, I would refer you -- I will refer a lot of these questions that have to do with strategic campaign decisions to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 But the President obviously agrees with this decision because of what the campaign has said, is that the rules are what they are, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- the campaign -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the same reports you have read -- the campaign has made clear that they cannot engage in this campaign, they cannot compete effectively if there are two sets of rules -- if they play by a different set of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So from the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, do you not see any inconsistency in talking about the corrosive influence of money, and then encouraging donors to give to groups that collect --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, his views on the problems associated with this decision have not changed, and he has expressed them as recently as a few days ago and will continue to express them.\xc2\xa0 Two, the President, Vice President, First Lady, Dr. Biden will not appear at any of these events associated with these organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just a decision that was made by the campaign, by the President and the team, not to do that.\xc2\xa0 Those individuals with the campaign and with the White House who appear at events -- political campaign events already for the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign will be available to appear before the super PAC, but they will not solicit funds.\xc2\xa0 And again, I would refer you to the campaign for the strategic decision about why the rules are what they are, unfortunately.\xc2\xa0 The Citizens United decision pertains, unfortunately -- and this President will be committed, as long as he\xe2\x80\x99s in office, to trying to change that and has made clear that -- I mean, last year, let\xe2\x80\x99s just remember that this is not a case of apples and apples here in our approach to this issue. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President very strongly supported with Democrats on Capitol Hill the DISCLOSE Act, which would have required simple disclosure, something that Republicans used to be for when they opposed other campaign finance measures back in the 1990s when I covered Congress -- disclosure was the answer, they said.\xc2\xa0 But then when disclosure became the call of President Obama and Democrats, Republicans opposed it.\xc2\xa0 They opposed the simple idea that the American people ought to know who\xe2\x80\x99s donating to these political campaigns. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President still supports absolutely the passage of the disclosure act.\xc2\xa0 He supports measures that would change the dynamic created by the Citizens United decision, even if that requires a constitutional amendment.\xc2\xa0 If that is what it would require he would support that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is a huge difference between the approach this President takes and the approach taken by the Republican Party, by would-be presidential nominees of the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 And I think that distinction will be clear to voters who care about this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given how much he has opposed the Citizens decision, and these PACs, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s giving his approval to this, did he wrestle with this at all before he gave thumbs up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you can divine that, that this is a decision that was carefully considered, by the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s February of 2012, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen in the Republican Party how much money is being raised by these organizations -- hundreds of millions of dollars, or so I read, of it totally undisclosed.\xc2\xa0 And I would point out that campaign officials, administration officials who appear before a super PAC that supports Democrats or the President will only appear before those super PACs that disclose their donors.\xc2\xa0 They will not appear before so-called (c)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s that do not disclose.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So disclosure remains an absolute priority of this President and his campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic, please.\xc2\xa0 On the decision about the religious-affiliated groups and contraception, you were asked last week if there\xe2\x80\x99s a debate within the administration about reconsidering, and you flatly said, no, the decision has been made.\xc2\xa0 Does that absolutely remain the case, no reconsideration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It does.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to making sure that all women have access to these important preventive services.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is important to remember what was clearly stated when this policy decision was announced and that is that we will be working with those organizations and individuals who have concerns about the implementation of this rule, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why that time period of a full year beginning in August of 2012 was put into place because the President is very interested in finding the appropriate balance between religious beliefs and convictions -- and he takes those very seriously -- and his commitment to making sure that women of all faiths have access to these important health care preventive services.\xc2\xa0 So that process will continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that that point was overlooked in the initial coverage of the decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the end of the year -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the date of the end-of-the-year period?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 August of 2013.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 August -- you just said 2012, okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It begins in 2012 I believe, and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to wrap up on this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s a perception out there -- and in some cases David Axelrod\xe2\x80\x99s comments led some to think that the very implementation you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about over the next year or so will lead to a different outcome, that in the rule-making, there will be some deal cut, some out given to get away from this controversy.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, no matter how it\xe2\x80\x99s implemented, will the bottom line remain the same, that these organizations have to provide that contraceptive coverage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s interest is in making sure that -- on the one side of this balance -- is in making sure that all American women, all women here, have access to the same preventive care services.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is also concerned about and understands the religious concerns that have been raised and takes seriously the religious convictions that are behind the concerns that have been raised.\xc2\xa0 And we will work in this period to see if there is a way, to try to find a way to make sure that the implementation of the policy or to see if the implementation of the policy can be done in a way that allays some of those concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are ways to I think help resolve this issue that ensures that we provide that important preventive service, that health care coverage, to all women, and that tries -- in a way that also tries to allay some of these concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reuters.\xc2\xa0 And then Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 When did the President sign off on the decision to support Priorities USA?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you -- as I will on a lot of these -- to Chicago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already asked.\xc2\xa0 Can you take the question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already asked.\xc2\xa0 When?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I think they would probably have the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They had a conference call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does he expect it to achieve?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the campaign about campaign tactics, strategy, how resources are raised.\xc2\xa0 And that would obviously, in that case, I suppose, be a question to ask of the outside organization.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, as I just stated, an enormous amount of money raised by these organizations, a significant portion of it totally undisclosed.\xc2\xa0 And the campaign, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve read and you\xe2\x80\x99ve read, has made the decision that they can\xe2\x80\x99t unilaterally disarm and that they can\xe2\x80\x99t play by -- play or engage in the campaign by a different set of rules as their opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again -- but these are discussions -- this is an analysis of sort of strategic campaign decisions, and I think Chicago is the right place to take those questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the difference between having a White House official speaking at an event like this and actually asking for money?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we will comply with all the rules, all the laws that govern this.\xc2\xa0 It is a long-established rule that administration officials can and do engage, in private time, in political activity.\xc2\xa0 This administration, like others before it, has officials who engage in private political activity in their private time on behalf of the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, and they will be able to do that now -- or the campaign has made a decision that they might be able to, or will be able to appear at events for these outside organizations.\xc2\xa0 But they will not directly solicit funds, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t participate in raising funds.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re appearing at a fundraiser, how is that not soliciting funds?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the organizations here that are -- the campaign and the super PAC that are making these decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about White House officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there is a difference between asking for money and appearing and making the case for why the President should be reelected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you on one other topic --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not much of a difference, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I disagree.\xc2\xa0 You guys can make your --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One non-PAC topic.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys -- does the White House have a reaction to the appeals court ruling on California\xe2\x80\x99s gay marriage act?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on litigation in general in this litigation with which we are not a party -- or to which we are not a party.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I can say that the President has long opposed, as you know, divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you, Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the health care rule on birth control -- this rule doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide those health services for all women, as you said, though, right?\xc2\xa0 Because there is a carve-out for houses of worship. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 There is an exemption for churches and houses of worship.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the principle here is that churches and houses of worship, it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue of hiring people of like faith, versus these large institutions, like universities and hospitals, where, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a nurse or a teacher, a professor, a student, a janitor, somebody in administration -- you are going to have folks of all faiths who work for those large institutions.\xc2\xa0 And therefore the President believes that they ought to be able to have access -- those women ought to be able to have access to the same contraceptive services that other women will have access to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a middle ground somewhere where perhaps some of these religious organizations that aren\xe2\x80\x99t specifically houses of worship, but are Catholic or Jewish or Baptist hospitals, charities, of a smaller size could be -- could receive the same exemption as the houses of worship?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about people who think that some methods of birth control are murder, are a sin, and the Obama administration is forcing them to be party to that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the crux here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear -- and first of all, we understand the religious concerns here.\xc2\xa0 That is why this balance was sought.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the process going forward includes a transition period where this discussion will continue to see if there can be ways found that ensure that women get access to these preventive services and that those services are covered -- as they will be for all other women -- and that also takes into account these religious concerns. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, the rule does not require any individual or institution to provide contraception.\xc2\xa0 It requires coverage for women who work there of different faiths, or of any faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It provides them to pay for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate all the different possibilities of how this rule could be implemented in a way that might allay some of those concerns.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the transition period is for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching topics to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice -- Dr. Susan Rice said that she was \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusted\xe2\x80\x9d by the vote of Russia and China when it came to the Syria -- the U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama share that view?\xc2\xa0 Would he use the word \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusted\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 And why does the White House think Russia and China voted against that resolution?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t presume to speak for either of those two governments or any foreign government.\xc2\xa0 Our views are that it was the wrong decision to block that Security Council resolution and to, in effect, by doing that give solace to and help sustain a regime that is brutally murdering its own people, and a regime that by the way is not going to last.\xc2\xa0 There will be a transition in Syria.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it is a mistake, we believe, for any country to put its eggs in that basket, if you will, because by doing that you\xe2\x80\x99re alienating the Syrian people and many others in the region who are on the side of putting pressure on the Assad regime to get it to stop this behavior and to step aside so that a transition can take place in Syria.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we are going to work with -- continue to work with international allies and partners, and with other friends of Syria -- friends of the Syrian people to continue to pressure the Assad regime so that it ceases this reprehensible behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President use the word \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusted\xe2\x80\x9d as his ambassador did?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put words in his mouth, but the ambassador --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s speaking for the White House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, the ambassador -- the sentiments the ambassador was expressing reflect our great disappointment with that position taken.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to obviously have these discussions with all of our partners internationally at the United Nations Security Council and elsewhere, and we will continue to work with others -- or sort of friends of Syria and the Syrian people to put the pressure that is required on the Assad regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Lieberman said that it might be time for the United States to get in the business of helping to arm the opposition and take more aggressive measures.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the administration is willing to consider?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate.\xc2\xa0 I believe we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we are not considering that step right now.\xc2\xa0 We are exploring the possibility of providing humanitarian aid to Syrians and we are working with our partners, again, to ratchet up the pressure, ratchet up the isolation on Assad and his regime.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a lot of indications of a lack of control over the country by the regime, of interest by senior officials within the military and the government in separating themselves from the regime.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that that pressure is having an impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ultimately it needs to result in Assad ceasing the violence, stopping the brutality, and allowing for a transition supported by the Syrian people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I do a follow-up on Syria?\xc2\xa0 You talk about humanitarian aid and different option.\xc2\xa0 Are there any option, any tangible options are you currently working on?\xc2\xa0 Some argue that buffer zone could be one of the way, or -- Turkish Foreign Minister is coming also to D.C. tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Would you be able to tell us what are the options right now you are working on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, all I said is that we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly exploring possible humanitarian aid.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think we all know what humanitarian aid is.\xc2\xa0 For more details about the discussions that we\xe2\x80\x99re having with other friends of the Syrian people I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Clinton has discussed this publicly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you view the Russian Foreign Minister is today in Damascus?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your understanding?\xc2\xa0 Is this helpful?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure what the goals of his visit are.\xc2\xa0 But the point we\xe2\x80\x99re making is that Russia must realize that betting everything on Assad is a recipe for failure -- not just for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interests in Syria, but for the stability of the region and for Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 And I would just reemphasize what I said in response to the earlier question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on the Prop 8 ruling.\xc2\xa0 Back in 2008, candidate Obama came out against Proposition 8 that was on the ballot, calling it unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the President shares a belief that that measure is also unconstitutional.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on litigation, particularly as here where we are not a party to it.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s positions on these issues writ large are well known and he\xe2\x80\x99s long opposed divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on that particular decision or any update --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow really quickly on that, though.\xc2\xa0 You just said that the President opposes divisive and discriminatory efforts against same-sex couples, but the effort here -- the issue in question is marriage.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t it inconsistent for the President to be -- not support same-sex marriage and also to be against such measures?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on that particular issue with regards to the President\xe2\x80\x99s views.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples are something that this President has long opposed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an important point to make, that these are proactive, deliberate efforts to deny benefits and to be discriminatory.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll bounce back and forth.\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In October 2010, the President said the Citizens United decision, because it enabled these groups to keep their donors secret, was a threat to democracy itself.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that by requiring his supporting super PAC to disclose the donors, he basically removes that threat?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s concern with the Citizens United decision was broad and not just limited to that issue.\xc2\xa0 It is an important point that you make that disclosure is important, and this President has been forcefully in favor of measures that would mandate disclosure despite -- unfortunately he has faced uniform resistance by Republicans in Congress to those efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is correct that as I understand this -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re reaching the boundaries of my understanding of how these new outfits operate -- that there is a distinction between those that are required to disclose their donors every month, I believe, and those that are not required to disclose at all.\xc2\xa0 And campaign officials, administration officials who might appear before a super PAC supporting the President would only appear before those that disclose.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President has railed against this type of funding of elections.\xc2\xa0 I mean, to read back to you what he did say in the State of the Union, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think American elections should be bankrolled by America\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities.\xc2\xa0 They should be decided by the American people.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the President reversing course on this, does he look hypocritical?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President firmly believes that the effects of the Citizens United decision were as he described or predicted, and we are seeing that play out in many ways in the Republican primary process, which you all have covered or many of your colleagues have covered with the millions and millions of dollars being spent, almost entirely on negative advertising, and much of it completely undisclosed, so people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he spent 2010 --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- let me finish -- the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t have any idea who is backing that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the fact is -- and I will point you to the comments I made in response to Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question about the efforts that this President has taken, that no President, no administration has taken before him, the principles that he adopts by not accepting any money from PACs or lobbyists, which distinguishes him from any of his potential Republican primary -- general election opponents -- and his efforts towards -- to get Congress to pass a disclosure act and other measures that would enhance the transparency of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, it is an unfortunate situation, the President believes, that we find ourselves in where the rules are as they are.\xc2\xa0 This decision was made, and I point you the campaign statements that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and you have seen about the fact that -- the rules being what they are, the campaign has made clear that they cannot unilaterally disarm in a circumstance like this.\xc2\xa0 So we are taking the approach -- the campaign is taking the approach that it\xe2\x80\x99s taking, and the President is taking the approach that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President spent much of 2010 on the road ridiculing these groups.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he joked about the name -- they could call themselves anything, like \xe2\x80\x9cMoms for Motherhood\xe2\x80\x9d -- I mean, he really decried their influence in elections.\xc2\xa0 And now he has signaled to his campaign that he would like his donors to contribute as well.\xc2\xa0 You indicated, when asked about when the President made this decision -- you said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou could divine that,\xe2\x80\x9d and that -- clearly since he\xe2\x80\x99s made this in February of 2012.\xc2\xa0 So has the President been putting off this decision?\xc2\xa0 Were you indicating that he\xe2\x80\x99s left it to so late in the game because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to do this, but since he\xe2\x80\x99s watched what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the Republican primary, he\xe2\x80\x99s finally relented and said, \xe2\x80\x9cRight, the Republicans have so much money, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to give up on my principles because\xe2\x80\x9d --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, you can throw in a lot of editorializations into your question, or you can just save them for your piece.\xc2\xa0 But the -- (laughter) -- but the fact of the matter is this President\xe2\x80\x99s views on Citizens United have not been shrouded in secrecy.\xc2\xa0 They were clearly expressed --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did you mean when you said he waited until February 2012?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, hold on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did you mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I simply was asked, why did he -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the phrasing of the question -- did he spend a lot of time thinking about this?\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him that question, but I think you can understand, from the views that we -- that he has expressed about the Citizens United decision and the impact of that decision on the process, that he takes a dim view of it.\xc2\xa0 But it is also the case -- and again, I point you to the campaign here, and I think a lot of these questions are more aptly addressed to the campaign -- that, as the campaign has said, the rules are what they are.\xc2\xa0 We will continue, the President will continue to change the rules.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is not only is there not a constituency among Republicans in Congress to overturn or take action against Citizens United, there is not even a constituency among Republicans in Congress to allow the American people to know who the donors are.\xc2\xa0 They blocked the DISCLOSE Act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is the reality that we live in, and he will continue to press for change, and he will continue to press for change even if it requires a constitutional amendment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re asking a very simple question here, which is, the President, who has railed against these groups and this decision, in his State of the Union address and spoke multiple times on the campaign trail in 2010 decrying this, has now changed his mind.\xc2\xa0 And so the simple question is, when did he make that decision to change his mind?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re misrepresenting what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and I assume you were in contact with the campaign.\xc2\xa0 He has not changed his mind about these -- the rules, and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did not offer his public support for his own --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, he\xe2\x80\x99s not supporting -- he is not saying that the system is now healthy or good.\xc2\xa0 He is saying -- he is making a decision, his campaign is making a decision that the rules are what they are, and they will not -- they cannot play by a different set of rules than Republicans are playing.\xc2\xa0 But the situation -- these groups are --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He gave a signal -- he gave a signal, and his campaign manager put out an email.\xc2\xa0 When did the President signal to his campaign manager that it was okay to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we just -- the campaign announced it today, or yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President gave the signal yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was asked -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s -- if this is the windup to asking me precisely the moment that the President made this decision, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that question, as I indicated about 15 minutes ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Julianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Since the President is going to continue to push for changing the system, since he saw the influence of these groups back in 2010, was there more that he could have done over the last two years to change the system --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has pushed very hard for changes in the system.\xc2\xa0 He, again, at the State of the Union address just a few weeks ago, put forward proposals for political reform in Congress that would help improve the system and reduce the influence of money in politics.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to work towards it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as I was just saying to Norah, a simple measure that would have demanded that donors are disclosed -- that the American people have the right to know who is making donations in the tens and hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars -- per person -- to these organizations got no Republican support in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So -- or virtually no Republican support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate dynamic, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stop this President from continuing to try to find ways to deal with this problem.\xc2\xa0 And maybe this cycle will change people\xe2\x80\x99s views about the role of money in politics, because it is simply a fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing hundreds of millions of dollars in the system, much of it undisclosed, or some of it undisclosed, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are that\xe2\x80\x99s not a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow on Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s question, will administration officials who are appearing at fundraisers for the super PAC -- will their names be on the invitations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign or to -- or I guess in this case the super PAC.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in 2008, the President pretty clearly told the outside groups to stand down, and they did.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m unclear about is, up until now, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t expressly told people not to give to Priorities USA, is that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think most of you were part of the campaign call, or could have been, earlier today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about prior to this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand, but I think they probably would have made clear what the announcement was today versus what it might be perceived to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you would have known what his position was before today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that today the only decision is that campaign officials and administration officials can appear before these organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But he never -- he did not repeat his two thousand and -- until today --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, Mara, but you would have to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he never repeated his 2008 request for people not to give.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just said not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Lara -- I mean Laura, sorry.\xc2\xa0 Lara, Mara, Laura -- yes, Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was going to respond no matter what.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 On the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Penelope, please, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Proposition 8, the President -- is it still the -- or I should just say, in general, is it still the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that same-sex marriage is an issue that should be decided by the states -- each individual state?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 However you might want to tease out an evolutionary position on this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you what his position -- if his position has changed that states should make these decisions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcement of any changes in his position on this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, given that that is his latest position that he\xe2\x80\x99s stated, is that states should make the decision, why would he not be supportive of California making the decision through the vote in Proposition 8 to ban same-sex marriage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because he opposes divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 But again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not commenting on specific litigation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about his general opposition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t any of the states that have banned -- all sorts of states have banned same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 Are all of those divisive and discriminatory as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t at this moment stand here and analyze each one.\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you the President\xe2\x80\x99s long opposition to divisive and discriminatory efforts.\xc2\xa0 And you know his position, where it stands now, on the issue of same-sex marriage, so I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have much to add on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamental inconsistency -- correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong -- if he says on one hand it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the states to decide, but that those states who decide that they\xe2\x80\x99re against it are divisive and discriminatory.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not offering a blanket -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about general efforts that are divisive and discriminatory.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not making an assessment on specific states or state laws.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, I would repeat the original question --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a better answer for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how is this not just complete hypocrisy if he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s up to states to decide but he won\xe2\x80\x99t back a state that does make the decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on a specific litigation that is for a specific state.\xc2\xa0 I can say that the President has long opposed divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 And his overall record on the issue of LGBT rights I think is well known and is one that he is very proud of. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kristen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to try just one more on Proposition 8.\xc2\xa0 How does today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on Proposition 8 inform the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on same-sex marriage, which he said is evolving?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add on that.\xc2\xa0 The decision was made about, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, within the hour before I came out here, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And without getting into actually --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me how his view has changed by this decision, and it happened an hour ago. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to him about it at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I have not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then one more, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner said of the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to support super PACs that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust another broken promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And Russ Feingold said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe President is wrong to embrace the corrupt corporate politics in Citizens United through the use of super PACs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just bad policy; it\xe2\x80\x99s also dumb strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Can you react to that and to the fact that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, for your questions of strategy I would refer you to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the Citizens United decision is well known.\xc2\xa0 I suppose critics like the Speaker who are making this point should be also -- I think along that, they should talk about their refusal to back proposals to even require that donors be disclosed to the public and their absolute I guess support of the Citizens United decision, which allows somebody to write a $100 million check, potentially, and not disclose it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know the decision that the campaign is making is for any administration official or campaign official who appears before an organization like this will only appear before those that disclose by law, and that is an important distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is important to remember that the system as it is is not healthy, and this President has spoken out against it and will continue to work to take action to fix that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t this opened him up to criticism from all sides?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think criticism from all sides comes with the territory in politics.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s views are very well known on the Citizens United decision that allowed this circumstance to come about.\xc2\xa0 For the strategic reasons that the campaign made this decision, I refer you to Chicago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, one last try here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious how you can be proactively -- or how the President can be proactively against divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny people civil rights, but not proactively be for the concept of marriage equality?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I totally appreciate the question, but I am not here to announce a new position for the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want you to just illuminate the current position --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would refer you to the comments the President has made on this issue, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any changes to provide to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Donovan, and then April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I actually want to go back to contraception. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On January 20th, when this decision was announced, Secretary Sebelius said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will continue to work closely with religious groups during this transitional period to discuss their concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the point I\xe2\x80\x99m making, is that in the initial coverage of the decision, the fact that this transitional period was put in place precisely to have these discussions with religious groups about their concerns was in many cases overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not about a change in policy, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply to shine a light on that announcement and the fact that this transitional period has been in place since the announcement, and that its purpose is to have these discussions so that we can see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to ensure that we can implement the policy that provides important health care coverage of preventative services to women and also can allay some of these concerns that are expressed by religious groups, which the President takes seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it -- would it be fair to say that the White House is not ruling out granting further exemptions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President is committed to providing -- to ensuring that the law provides the same coverage to all women of the important preventive services here that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing.\xc2\xa0 There are enormous health benefits to providing those services, there are financial benefits, and the President is committed to doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How the process moves forward in these discussions in terms of examining possible ways that we could potentially allay some of these concerns, there are a lot of different ideas out there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sort of grade them from here, but that the whole purpose of the transition period was to have that discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Brianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was next.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable to provide to you, April.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 This is -- as the President discussed when he answered this question a while back, this is a process that involves his faith and the way he views these issues, and as he said -- and I won\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond that -- his views are evolving.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an endpoint to that to announce to you or a date certain to tell you that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has strong support from the LBGT community.\xc2\xa0 Is he in consultation with many members of that community about this evolving mindset?\xc2\xa0 When is the last time --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has a lot of conversations with a lot of people, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t say one way or the other whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s had that discussion with anybody.\xc2\xa0 He may have, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Brianna.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re next.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the contraception issue, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to kind of discern here, is the administration open to women employed by religious employers receiving coverage for contraception in a different way than women employed by non-religious employers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, without getting into different potential options --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the details, I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But no -- but I think your question illuminates an important issue here, which is the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest at a policy level is in making sure that this coverage is extended to all women because it\xe2\x80\x99s important financially.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to individual woman\xe2\x80\x99s health and also to health writ large for the country.\xc2\xa0 So within that, that\xe2\x80\x99s the -- on the one side. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other side of finding the right balance is concerns about religious beliefs and convictions.\xc2\xa0 So we will in this transition period and these discussions seek to find ways to implement that policy that allay some of those concerns.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all the various possibilities those discussions will entertain, or predict how successful they will be in allaying everyone\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that is the approach the President is taking, and that is why when the decision was initially announced that Secretary Sebelius made clear that that process was put into place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had said last week that the decision, the ruling does strike a balance.\xc2\xa0 And it sounds now like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he\xe2\x80\x99s working -- or you\xe2\x80\x99re working -- the administration is working towards finding a balance.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there seems to be distinction there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the decision to exempt churches and houses of worship -- an exemption that, as I noted before, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even exist in I think eight states in the country -- represents an effort to find that balance, and he believes he found the appropriate balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with religious groups to try to allay their concerns as we implement a policy that provides this coverage to women across the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the issue of religious employers, because, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken with and a ton of people here have spoken with people who are concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t even -- the issue of contraception isn\xe2\x80\x99t really an issue for them, but when it comes down to telling a religious employer of their religious persuasion what they can and cannot do that really bothers them, and so they want to know if there\xe2\x80\x99s been a change, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Brianna, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion that will take place about these issues.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment is ensuring that this health care coverage is provided to women, and I think there are -- one important point to make, as we have this discussion, is that 28 states already require insurance companies to provide contraceptive services.\xc2\xa0 Eight states, as I noted in the past, provide no exemption, not even the exemption that the policy announced by Secretary Sebelius provides, for churches and houses of worship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is an important context within which to view the policy decision as well as this period of transition as we discuss the various concerns that have been raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I talk about Egypt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do I want to talk about Egypt?\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why in the world would the United States give $1.5 billion to Egypt at this time (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 And any update on the Americans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 More editorializing from -- well, I think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on I believe the situation that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the comments I made yesterday about our serious concern, grave concern about the crackdown on NGOs within Egypt, our concern about the Americans involved in this, and the fact that we are discussing our concern with all levels of the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to the comments I made yesterday about the fact that we have made clear that the consequences of this action could potentially affect our relationship and could potentially affect the aid that we provide.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more to say on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Steve.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier you said something like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to explore the possibilities of humanitarian aid for Syrians.\xc2\xa0 How exactly would that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have mechanisms for that.\xc2\xa0 But simply, I would point you to the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s comments about continuing to work with friends of the Syrian people, friends of Syria, to put pressure on the regime, to assist Syrians who are simply looking for a peaceful transition to democracy here for a post-Assad Syria, and the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be involved in, working with our partners and allies, to see if we can help in that regard, even as we continue to ratchet up the pressure on the regime to get it to stop killing its own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, are you actively working on creating the group, friends of Syria group?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I can point you to the extensive comments by the Secretary of State.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alexis, last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question on super PACs.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a policy personally, are you going to participate in campaign speaking -- appearing before Priorities USA?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that that is the change that has been made clear today, that there is a decision --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there was an affirmative \xe2\x80\x9cdo not speak\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the campaign, but that is my --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you a White House question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, and I would -- but the campaign has done a lot more work on this issue.\xc2\xa0 But that is my understanding, yes, Alexis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the last question on this question -- a couple weeks ago, David Axelrod, who obviously worked here, talked very pejoratively about Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s use of what he called the \xe2\x80\x9cdog whistle\xe2\x80\x9d to in an uncoordinated way signal to his super PACs what he wanted them to do -- \xe2\x80\x9cgo get my\xe2\x80\x9d whatever.\xc2\xa0 So what is different about the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort today to signal that he would give this reluctant endorsement?\xc2\xa0 Is that a dog whistle, too?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the distinction -- there are a couple of distinctions.\xc2\xa0 One -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand the context of your question because I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember those remarks, but two distinctions.\xc2\xa0 One -- and whether they answer your question you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to decide -- but the President will not be appearing before these groups.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will not be appearing before these groups.\xc2\xa0 Neither will the First Lady or Dr. Biden.\xc2\xa0 The groups that administration officials might be appearing before, and campaign officials might be appearing before, will be only those that disclose.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the strategy behind that and why that decision was made within the context of this election season and this campaign season, I would refer you to Chicago. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:50 P.M.
