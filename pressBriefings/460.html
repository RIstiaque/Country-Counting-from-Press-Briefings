EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make the first of two stops, the first being to Pittsburgh, where, as you know, the President will be meeting with workers at TechShop, a company that helps American investors make affordable prototypes.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll continue his drumbeat about expanding opportunity for all Americans by focusing on additional ways that we can create good jobs by continuing to spur innovation, entrepreneurship and manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99ll host the first-ever White House Maker Faire as part of this effort.\xc2\xa0 And that Maker Faire will feature Americans who are making new, innovative products, and who reflect the best of our country\xe2\x80\x99s entrepreneurial spirit.</p>\n<p>Ahead of today\xe2\x80\x99s visit, we announced new steps to further spur manufacturing and innovation, including a partnership with mayors across the country who will bring this makers movement to their own backyards.\xc2\xa0 At TechShop today, the President will take a tour of their facility before delivering remarks and taking questions from TechShop workers and member organizations who use their services.</p>\n<p>I have, obviously, more detail, and you may as well, about TechShop and about today\xe2\x80\x99s event.\xc2\xa0 Happy to take questions on that and any other subject.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you -- or, Josh --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Josh!\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 How quickly we forget!\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I take it back.\xc2\xa0 Let me start again.\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk a bit about this Libyan raid that captured a suspect in the Benghazi attack?\xc2\xa0 What the U.S. plans to do with him in terms of the judicial system, how he will be detained, and how he will be treated?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can only tell you that the Department of Defense has issued a statement confirming that the United States military, in cooperation with law enforcement personnel, captured Ahmed Abu Khatallah, a key figure in the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, in September of 2012.\xc2\xa0 He is in U.S. custody in a secure location outside of Libya.\xc2\xa0 For more details and any questions about the operation, I would refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>More broadly, we have made it clear since that cowardly attack on our facilities that we would go to any lengths to find, apprehend, and bring to justice those who perpetrated it and were responsible for the deaths of four Americans.\xc2\xa0 The capture of Abu Khatallah is not the end of that effort, but it marks an important milestone.</p>\n<p>So this is an important development, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of things.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice -- I mean, rather, the Department of Defense will be providing more details later in the day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just about him, though, is it accurate that he is a mastermind, the mastermind?\xc2\xa0 Can you fill us in on that a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize that.\xc2\xa0 He obviously was a key figure in the attacks, but beyond that I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he at Guantanamo?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s at a secure location outside of Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Typically, those have been U.S. military ships.\xc2\xa0 Can you say that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said about him being at a secure location out of Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the process for bringing him to justice would be a military tribunal court system?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At this point, Jim, because obviously this has just been reported and the initial statement has just gone out from the Department of Defense, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more details about the process moving forward at this time, but we will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything about when and where it\xe2\x80\x99ll happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the reports, and the Department of Defense and I just noted, it was an operation involving U.S. military personnel as well as law enforcement personnel that led to the capture of this individual.\xc2\xa0 But more details will be forthcoming later in the day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, reports are that this guy had been kind of operating openly in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Any idea why it took to this point to capture him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For details on the operation I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 What I think this makes clear is that<br/>\n\twhen it comes to doing what we, as the United States, said we would do, which is bring to justice those responsible for the acts in Benghazi, there\xe2\x80\x99s no time limit on that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re patient and we fulfill our commitments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think this says to the political critics of the President on Benghazi in terms of -- I mean, does this, from your perspective, silence some of their criticisms?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really think this is entirely about the objective that we had as a country in the immediate aftermath and ever since, which is to bring those responsible to justice.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been our focus and continues to be our focus -- that and of course taking the steps necessary to ensure that we can prevent these kinds of attacks in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After last night\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, what\xe2\x80\x99s the timetable for the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision on Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more insight into that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as we noted, met with his National Security Council yesterday, late yesterday, to discuss the situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to consult with his national security team in the days to come.\xc2\xa0 They will also -- he and his team will continue to consult with members of Congress to share views and discuss possible responses.\xc2\xa0 Those consultations will continue, including closed briefings with a number of committees this week.</p>\n<p>As you know, the President directed his national security team to develop a range of options, and that work is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think that rather than discuss timetables, I would note that the national security team is preparing options that are part of a comprehensive strategy -- because we have been clear, the President has been clear, that this is not primarily a military challenge.\xc2\xa0 It is evident, of course, that Iraq needs significantly more help to break the momentum of extremist groups and to bolster the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>But there is no military solution that will solve Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s problems, which is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been urgently pressing Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders across the political spectrum to govern in a non-sectarian manner; to promote stability and unity among Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population; to address the legitimate grievances of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni, Kurd and Shia communities; and build and invest in the capacity of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Along those lines, we welcome the Iraqi Federal Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ratification of the April 30th election results.\xc2\xa0 This is an extremely important step as Iraq undertakes a peaceful transition of power from one elected government to another.\xc2\xa0 With the election results officially ratified, we call on Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to move forward expeditiously to form an inclusive and representative government that represents the people of Iraq as determined through the democratic and constitutional process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s critical that all political leaders come together without delay to put the interest of the Iraqi people foremost in their negotiations to establish the makeup of a new government.</p>\n<p>We have also supported Iraqi political and religious leaders and their call for national unity to confront the ISIL terrorist threat.\xc2\xa0 Most notably, were calls from Grand Ayatollah Sistani\xe2\x80\x99s office over the weekend to avoid sectarian actions that would harm the unity and national fabric of the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 And he also emphasized the need for volunteers to work through the legal framework.\xc2\xa0 In that light, Iraqi National Security Advisor Fayad also announced the formation of a public mobilization effort to regulate the thousands of volunteers who have stepped forward to assist Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces at this time of need.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does this constitute the move toward an inclusive political agenda that the President said he wanted to see before he would consider military action?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important step.\xc2\xa0 It is still very much an imperative that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders take steps to become more united, to govern in a non-sectarian manner so that it is clear to all members of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s diverse population that ISIL is a threat to the Iraqi nation and to all Iraqis, and that the government and the security forces are working on behalf of all of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s citizens regardless of their religious and ethnic background.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there are reports ISIL is 40 miles from Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 What kind of time does the President think he has before he at least moves to protect that city?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, the President has tasked his national security team to develop options, and that effort continues.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that in his view there is not a military solution to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s problems.\xc2\xa0 There is a near-term challenge presented by the movement of ISIL through the north and west of the country and towards Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 And we are assessing that situation and will continue to do that, and will continue to look at options available to us to assist the Iraqi security forces in that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President narrow any options at the NSC meeting last night?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did he what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he narrow anything?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize it beyond to say that the President tasked the national security team to develop options.\xc2\xa0 And at the meeting yesterday, the national security team and the President discussed the situation in Iraq and the development of those options.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he offer -- or do you have deadline to have the options and go over things for -- by Thursday, by Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a timeframe.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President has made clear that the issue here in terms of the United States and our national security interest is the necessity to prevent ISIL from establishing a terrorist safe haven in the region.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s first and foremost, obviously, our primary interest when it comes to the national security of the United States and our partners and allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And to that end, the President is also making clear that the medium- and long-term challenges that Iraq faces cannot be solved militarily, they must be solved through actions taken by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to govern inclusively so that it is abundantly clear to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s citizens that extremist groups like ISIL do not have their interests at heart, that their actions have virtually nothing to do with domestic Iraqi politics, but have only to do with advancing a brutal extremist ideology in their country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Ryan Crocker this morning on CBS said that Secretary Kerry should already be on a plane to Baghdad, saying that the U.S. should take a stronger lead in diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 Given that the White House has said that this is a diplomatic solution, why haven\xe2\x80\x99t we seen that?\xc2\xa0 Or will we expect to see that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry has obviously been very engaged in this effort, as has Vice President Biden and other members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team.\xc2\xa0 For the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s travels, I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about consultations with Congress.\xc2\xa0 How much consultation has there been with allies like France and the UK?\xc2\xa0 And now that that refinery has been closed, that main refinery near Baghdad, at Baiji, has there been consultations with partners in the region about oil supplies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that issue, the second part of your question.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously in regular consultation with our allies and partners about the situation in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 275 people sent mainly to protect the embassy, but there were others there, are any of them allowed to interact with the Iraqi military -- give training, give advice?\xc2\xa0 Anything like that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A couple of points.\xc2\xa0 At the request of the U.S. State Department, the Department of Defense continues to provide security assistance for embassy personnel inside of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, a number of teams, totaling approximately 170 U.S. personnel, began arriving in Baghdad from within the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.\xc2\xa0 The personnel will provide assistance to the Department of State in connection with the temporary relocation of some staff from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to the U.S. Consulates General in Basra and Erbil and to the Iraq Support Unit in Amman.</p>\n<p>These U.S. military personnel are entering Iraq with the consent of the government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There have been a number of times when we have filed similar war power resolution letters and we have needed to augment existing security at our embassies.\xc2\xa0 The safety of personnel serving in diplomatic missions abroad is among our highest priorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The military has also moved approximately 100 personnel in the region to provide airfield management security and logistics support if required.\xc2\xa0 So their mission is to provide that security that I just described to the Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about training or advice?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we have a relationship -- a security relationship with Iraq that involves providing security training outside in a third country, as well as an advisory capacity.\xc2\xa0 These troops are focused on -- or these personnel are focused on security for the embassy and embassy personnel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, regarding allied contacts, has the President himself made calls to foreign leaders on the issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any foreign leader calls to update you on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without any readouts.\xc2\xa0 But has he made calls?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any that I have information on for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are all three of these events tonight fundraisers?\xc2\xa0 The galas --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is one event in which the President is attending as a participant, but he is not in this context -- sorry, this is the event -- I forget which one this is.\xc2\xa0 This is an event where he is attending the event as a special guest.\xc2\xa0 We announced his participation in super PAC events in February.\xc2\xa0 For the context, the President does not ask for or solicit funds at this event.\xc2\xa0 The other two I believe are committee events.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a PAC, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fundraiser event?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, his participation is not -- is guided by what I just said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on the maritime -- on this maritime executive action.\xc2\xa0 When is he going to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that for you, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you put it right before we took off, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have anything on that, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be much drilling in that area of the Pacific maritime region that they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This the ocean stuff?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama is committed to protecting the ocean and its marine ecosystems.\xc2\xa0 Americans all over the country depend on the ocean for food, jobs and recreation.\xc2\xa0 But the health of our ocean is under threat on multiple fronts, from over-fishing to carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 Recognizing these significant challenges, President Obama launched the National Ocean Policy early in his first term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This week, the State Department is hosting the \xe2\x80\x9cOur Ocean\xe2\x80\x9d Conference, an international conference on sustainable fisheries, marine pollution and ocean acidification that concludes today.\xc2\xa0 As part of the conference, the President is announcing several steps that the U.S. is taking to answer that call, including protections for world-class marine areas and steps to combat black market fishing and supporting fishermen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For more details, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department and the Council on Environmental Quality.\xc2\xa0 I hope that was responsive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a pleasure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And congrats.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:09 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
