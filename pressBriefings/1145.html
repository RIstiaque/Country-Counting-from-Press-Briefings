EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Memphis, Tennessee, where the President will deliver the commencement address at the Booker T. Washington High School, winner of the 2011 Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While in Memphis, as you know the President will meet with family affected by the flooding, state and local officials, first responders and volunteers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the violence along Israel\xe2\x80\x99s borders and the violence and the killings of Palestinian protestors?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, we regret the loss of life, and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those killed and wounded.\xc2\xa0 Israel, like all countries, has the right to prevent unauthorized crossings at its borders.\xc2\xa0 Its neighbors have a responsibility to prevent such activity.\xc2\xa0 We urge maximum restraint on all sides.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are also strongly opposed to the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in inciting yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s protests in the Golan Heights.\xc2\xa0 Such behavior is unacceptable and does not serve as a distraction from the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing repression of demonstrators in its own country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that Assad is doing this in order to deflect attention from his own problems?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly think that there\'s a history of that and it seems apparent to us that that is an effort to distract attention from the legitimate expressions of protests by the Syrian people and from the harsh crackdown that the Syrian government has perpetrated against its own people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the degree to the incitement yesterday is sort of heightened as a result of the Arab Spring, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could sort of put the President\xe2\x80\x99s address on Thursday in the context of that and also in the context of this week with Abdullah and Netanyahu being in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the President will deliver an address on the Middle East on Thursday and he will discuss, among several topics, the dramatic change we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the Middle East and North Africa this year.\xc2\xa0 He will also discuss the Middle East peace process and the need for that process to continue and succeed.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview too much of what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New York?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously won\xe2\x80\x99t comment on a legal matter. I can say obviously that we -- I think I have something here on that.\xc2\xa0 One minute, I thought I had something on it.\xc2\xa0 We remain -- we note that the IMF has said that they have appointed an acting director and the IMF remains fully functional and we remain confident in the institution of the IMF and its ability to continue to execute its mission effectively.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried that this will somehow hinder the efforts at securing certain packages for European countries that are --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the IMF will continue to function effectively.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given, though, that the situation in the Middle East and North Africa is still changing and evolving, is the speech going to sort of lay out where we are at this moment in time, the President\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a broader vision for what he sees --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will obviously address where we are in this remarkable period and will also address how he approaches the kind of historic change we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the region and how -- where he thinks we\xe2\x80\x99re headed, both as the United States in terms of our policy towards the region and the region itself.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Along those lines, Jay, the departure of Senator Mitchell -- former Senator Mitchell as a special envoy, does this signal a change in the approach that the President is going to take?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a new Cairo speech that kind of outlines his vision?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is very appreciative of Senator Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable service and effective service, and -- but it does not signal any change in that regard.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President watch the Endeavour launch?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we were on Marine One.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- well, we did not watch it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still think that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- area today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are, as you know, meeting with first responders, families and others today, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we have on the schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still think that we are in the midst of a new beginning with the Muslim world in terms of the relationship that the U.S. has?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that he does -- I mean, he believes that the history, as he said, of -- the future of that region will be written by the people of the region, and that what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is an expression of long pent-up desire for greater freedom, greater prosperity, greater engagement in the political process in these countries.\xc2\xa0 And obviously that has an effect on our engagement as the United States with the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is optimistic.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very fluid situation, and every country is different.\xc2\xa0 But he is optimistic about the potential for positive outcomes in the various countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you preview the meetings with Abdullah and Prime Minister Netanyahu this week -- will he discuss specifically steps --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think at each case they\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss the events in the region as well as the prospects for progress in the Middle East peace process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President address the flooding in his remarks today at the school?\xc2\xa0 And what sort of updates has he been getting or receiving on the situation in Mississippi?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting regular updates on the flooding in general, not just -- I mean, with regard to the Mississippi River, and the effects -- the impact it\xe2\x80\x99s had down river, as you would say.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview his remarks on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a readout of his meeting with the families and others, but beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s some -- been downgrading on the economic growth numbers from 3.3 to 2.8 today.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that and how that affects a long-term view for the recovery?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction to the specific prognoses, except to say that we obviously focus very much, the President is, on continuing to do the things that promote economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the wake of the contraction has been very positive and beneficial.\xc2\xa0 We are doing everything we can to ensure stronger growth, including investing in those programs that will -- and those areas that will allow us to grow and thrive economically and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that matters more to him than that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any worries about gas-price-driven inflation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously focus very much on the impact that higher gas prices have had on family budgets.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken to this and continues to monitor that.\xc2\xa0 He understands that for families that are, like the country, emerging out of a very tough economic time, and those who still are struggling, the sharp rise in prices at the pump is -- it was and is a very unwelcome development.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s very focused on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously, I\xe2\x80\x99ll note, as you all probably wrote about,\xc2\xa0 the decision to speed up some of the leasing and the decisions he made to expand in development, oil development, in the United States is part of his long-term commitment to make sure that we produce as much oil as possible, safely and responsibly in this country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s part of that goal, to reduce our dependency on foreign oil.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe that today was the day the debt limit was supposed to hit.\xc2\xa0 Is there any statement from the White House?\xc2\xa0 And has the President made any calls over the weekend for the budget --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on any calls he might have made.\xc2\xa0 But it is true that we are now in that period where we have essentially some cushion provided by the extraordinary measures the Treasury Secretary is able to take, as previous Treasury Secretaries have taken in a situation like this.\xc2\xa0 But it is a reminder that we need to have a vote to lift the debt ceiling because the consequences of not doing so would be quite serious, indeed.\xc2\xa0 And those who suggest otherwise are whistling past the graveyard.\xc2\xa0 It is a foolish thing to suggest that we could somehow as the United States of America default on our obligations and that it would not have seriously negative consequences if we suddenly stop paying our bills on a third of our obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, will the President take up AIPAC\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to speak to them before he leaves for Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 The President will address AIPAC on Sunday morning, May 22nd, to stress the importance of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the debt limit, what has the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement been in the Gang of Six talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been in regular consultations with those members of Congress who are approaching this issue seriously and looking at the need to address it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And that includes members of gangs and those who are unaffiliated with gangs.\xc2\xa0 So I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s vague enough for you. But obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in consultations with those members who are seriously interested in this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we see this -- just to address the broader point -- the President views the current situation as an opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Some of you who\xe2\x80\x99ve been in my office have heard me say for a long time that this President is committed to doing something significant and serious about our long-term deficit and debt problem and this is an opportunity to address that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he did the fiscal commission; that\xe2\x80\x99s why he laid out his plan; and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he asked the Vice President to oversee these negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he really thinks that this is an opportunity for the President, for Republicans and Democrats, to come together, find some common ground, and do something about a problem that we all recognize, which is that we need to reduce our deficit and our long-term debt in order to ensure that we have the kind of economic vitality in the 21st century that will allow us to win the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s addressing AIPAC on Sunday, does that mean that the speech on Thursday will have less on the Mid-East peace process?\xc2\xa0 Would he be saving that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the major speech of the week is Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I would not expect a major policy speech on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 I think he looks forward to talking about the unshakeable bond between the Israelis and the Americans and the importance of that relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, anything else?\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 10:43 A.M.
