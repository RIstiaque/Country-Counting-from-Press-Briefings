EST</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Welcome aboard Air Force One for our trip to Chicago. \xc2\xa0We will only be there a few hours, and then we\'ll go somewhere much warmer, to Florida for the evening. \xc2\xa0I\'ll make some opening remarks and describe to you a little bit more about the President\'s event in Chicago today, and then we\'ll open it up to questions. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tToday, the President will visit Hyde Park Academy in the Woodlawn neighborhood in Chicago where he will deliver remarks to Hyde Park Academy students, faculty, and community leaders on the economic proposals from his State of the Union address designed to strengthen the middle class and those striving to get there.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWoodlawn is a community where there is a locally organized, all-hands-on-deck approach to provide educational support for students, improve housing, expand economic opportunity, and attract jobs. \xc2\xa0That effort makes Woodlawn an appropriate backdrop for the President\'s focus today on the importance of building ladders of opportunity into the middle class. \xc2\xa0That includes policies that ensure that every child gets a great education starting from their earliest years; that our young people grow up in strong communities; that there are clearer opportunities for good jobs for all Americans; and that we support financial security for working families.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThese policies would benefit middle-class families in every single congressional district in the country. \xc2\xa0So every member of Congress who agrees with the President that our nation is strong only when we have a thriving middle class should be strongly supportive of this effort.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, prior to his remarks, the President will participate in a private roundtable discussion with 16 students who are enrolled in a youth anti-violence program. \xc2\xa0This program is a school-based counseling, mentoring, violence prevention and educational enrichment program that promotes social, emotional and behavioral growth for at-risk young men. \xc2\xa0The group is a mix of students who have voluntarily joined the program and those who have been urged by their principal to join.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs the President has often said in the past, there are important steps we can take as a country to keep guns out of the wrong hands and get weapons of war off the street. \xc2\xa0And he will talk about that again today, as well. \xc2\xa0But we must also recognize that it\'s not enough to debate the role of government in reducing violence. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s up to parents, teachers, principals, neighbors and communities as a whole to make a difference in the lives of our young people and steer them away from a life of gang violence and toward the classroom. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo with that, we\'ll take some questions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will there be any sort of spray of that meeting? \xc2\xa0Will we go in at all? \xc2\xa0Or just --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There won\'t be. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot built in -- extra time in his schedule before and after. \xc2\xa0Is there any chance that he\'s going to meet with victims\' families of the shooting?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t at this point have any additional meetings to read out to you. \xc2\xa0The roundtable discussion that the President will participate in with the young men that I just mentioned will take up some time, and that is what a bulk of that time is devoted to.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple of questions on Hagel. \xc2\xa0Has the White House ever said why it thinks Senate Republicans are linking Hagel\'s confirmation to the events in Benghazi? \xc2\xa0I mean, why are they so insistent on linking the two?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0In some ways, that may be a question that\xe2\x80\x99s better posed to the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \xc2\xa0I mean, the thing I can do is I can certainly restate to you the efforts -- the lengths, frankly, that we\'ve gone to, to try to accommodate the requests for information that have been posed by some Republican senators.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAgain, we\xe2\x80\x99ve hosted 20 member and staff briefings on this topic; 10 different congressional hearings; six different witness interviews. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve responded to 40 different inquiries, totaling up to 10,000 pages of documents. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut one thing I would add is Senator McCain gave an interview on Fox News yesterday explaining why he was delaying \xc2\xa0-- why he supported the delay in this confirmation vote. \xc2\xa0And I just want to read the exact quote from what he said, because I think it\'s pretty enlightening. \xc2\xa0He begins saying, "To be honest with you, Neil" -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to journalism school, but I think if I were a journalism professor I would encourage journalists\' ears to perk up when an interview -- when a person answering a question says, "to be honest with you." \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo in this case Senator McCain says, "To be honest with you, Neil, it goes back to -- there\'s a lot of ill will towards Senator Hagel, because when he was a Republican, he attacked President Bush." \xc2\xa0Senator McCain goes on to say later in the interview that Senator Hagel was "very anti his own party and people. \xc2\xa0People don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that," Senator McCain said. \xc2\xa0He finished saying, "You can disagree, but if you\'re disagreeable, then people don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that." \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think this is ironic -- well, I think this is clarifying. \xc2\xa0Because this is one of the things -- one of the concerns that we expressed at the very beginning of this nomination process, was that we articulated our view that Republicans should not oppose Senator Hagel merely because he was critical of the war in Iraq. \xc2\xa0Ironically, the President -- one of the reasons that the President chose Senator Hagel is because -- is that he demonstrated the courage of his convictions in standing up to intense political opposition to articulate his concerns about the war in Iraq. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThis demonstrates somebody who is of strong character, but also somebody who has a lot of good insight into the proper use of our military might. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now that the nomination has been delayed -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to give opponents -- Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s opponents some more time to oppose him and beat the drum against him. \xc2\xa0Is the White House -- is there any sort of effort to counter that in these next 10 days or so until his nomination comes to the Senate again?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, you have asked me a question about whether or not the Republicans in the Senate are going to try to politically capitalize on this delay. \xc2\xa0I would actually make the case to you that this delay is a political tactic. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if there are additional politics that are injected into this circumstance. \xc2\xa0It is extremely unfortunate. \xc2\xa0I referred to the President choosing Senator Hagel because of the courage of his convictions -- of Senator Hagel -- because of Senator Hagel demonstrating the courage of his convictions and the insight that he has demonstrated into foreign policy. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the kind of insight and exactly the kind of courage that our men and women -- 66,000 of whom are serving in Afghanistan right now -- need in their Secretary of Defense.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNext weekend, there will be a meeting of our NATO allies in Brussels where defense ministers from those allies will be participating in discussions about our drawdown in Iraq -- I mean, in Afghanistan -- will be participating in discussions about our drawdown in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0Our new Secretary of Defense, who will be responsible for coordinating those efforts, won\xe2\x80\x99t be there.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate there are Republicans in this case who are choosing to play politics as opposed to doing the right thing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I think the question, though, was, is the White House prepared with some sort of ready response team to counter the attacks that are sure to surface on former Senator Hagel during this 10-day period. \xc2\xa0And do you guys have your fax machine warmed up, ready to --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Our fax machine, huh? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That was funny.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The opponents have just bought themselves 10 days to muddy the waters. \xc2\xa0Are you guys ready to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that people are choosing to play politics with such an important issue at such a critically important time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI should say we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that Senator Hagel is going to be confirmed. \xc2\xa0We are challenging Republicans to drop their opposition -- or at least drop their delay. \xc2\xa0I mean, this is the other -- I guess this is the other point that I should make. \xc2\xa0This is unprecedented. \xc2\xa0Senator McCain, ironically enough, in a previous interview with Fox News, actually pointed out and acknowledged the unprecedented nature of filibustering the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to be Secretary of Defense. \xc2\xa0At that point, you\xe2\x80\x99d think that might be ancient history. \xc2\xa0That was five days ago that Senator McCain said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t support doing that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President spoken yet to Senator McCain or to Senator Graham?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to read out to you at this point.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask -- I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more thing about Hagel. \xc2\xa0Are you going to provide any more information to them to try to satisfy their concerns?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You mean in addition to the 20 member and staff briefings, the 10 congressional hearings, the 6 witness interviews, the 40 inquiries we\xe2\x80\x99ve responded to totaling 10,000 pages of documents, and the letter that was sent to Senate Republicans yesterday by the White House Counsel? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything else to telegraph to you that we might send to them via fax machine or any other modality.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President spoken to Senator Hagel in the last couple of days?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations to read out to you at this point.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, after the President leaves Chicago, we know he\xe2\x80\x99s going to Florida for what\xe2\x80\x99s been described as a guy\xe2\x80\x99s weekend. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve read some reports in other publications about some of the details but haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the full low-down from the White House. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s just do it for the record if we can. \xc2\xa0Can you describe -- is he playing golf? \xc2\xa0Is it at the Floridian? \xc2\xa0Is he getting a lesson from Tiger Woods\xe2\x80\x99s former coach, Butch Harmon? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple more, but --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have all those details handy, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t we talk on the way to Florida and I can get you some more details on this. \xc2\xa0But as I mentioned yesterday, the President is looking forward to spending President\xe2\x80\x99s Day weekend with some friends in Florida, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll take advantage of the opportunity to play some golf.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell us what access the press will have to the President during this weekend?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all the logistics are for this weekend. \xc2\xa0The truth is I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get through our event in Chicago, but that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something we can talk about before we arrive in Florida.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And will you release the list of the friends that he\xe2\x80\x99s playing with and staying with this weekend?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll work on getting that done. \xc2\xa0Again, I really just haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to look at it yet, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, too, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be working to try to do my best to get you the information that you need to do your job while you\xe2\x80\x99re there.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And is Ben Rhodes -- I\xe2\x80\x99m curious to know why he\xe2\x80\x99s on the trip. \xc2\xa0Is there -- I mean, is this also a working weekend for him? \xc2\xa0Is there something that can be read into this, or is he an avid golfer? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not been on the golf course with Ben before. \xc2\xa0Typically, when the President travels overnight, away from the White House, he\xe2\x80\x99ll often bring a member of his national security team just to be there to brief him and keep him updated as necessary on world events. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that Ben is coming. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that Ben brought his golf clubs.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a question on Benghazi. \xc2\xa0So Senator Graham was on Fox News recently and he said that DNI Clapper made the President aware of the two IED attacks on the consulate in April and June. \xc2\xa0Now, did the President take any action then?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have to refer you to my -- for that kind of a detailed, tick-tock question, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the National Security Staff, who can get you -- who can try to get you some more details on this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that information in front of me. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0North Korea is telling China that they may set off two more nuclear tests this year. \xc2\xa0Is there anything you can do to stop them? \xc2\xa0Or what\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports that apparently originated with some Chinese sources, I believe, about those conversations. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the content of those conversations. \xc2\xa0Suffice it to say, we have warned North Korea about the damaging consequences, or at least the -- I should say, the further isolation that\xe2\x80\x99s caused by their failure to live up to their international obligations. \xc2\xa0Each time we see one of these nuclear tests, it further isolates the country of North Korea, which has a terrible impact on the people of North Korea. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve their interests.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we encourage the North Koreans to live up to their international obligations, abandon their nuclear program, and work with the rest of the international community to become a responsible member of the international community.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was a report, shortly before we took off, that various world powers are signaling to Iran that they may ease gold sanctions in exchange for shutting down the Fordow plant. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about -- what can you confirm about that and what the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s role in this is?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on those reports. \xc2\xa0I do know that the United States and other members of the P5-plus-1 are looking forward to the talks that will take place in a couple of weeks in Kazakhstan. \xc2\xa0But in terms of those -- what kinds of things might be litigated at that meeting, or what kinds of negotiations may be underway in advance of that meeting, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that for you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Since Rhodes is on the plane, is that something that maybe you can get back to us on?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll look into it. \xc2\xa0If we have something on it, I can get it to you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s also a report that Mrs. Obama and her daughters are -- have a separate vacation plan for this weekend. \xc2\xa0Can you just confirm that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Those of you who have been covering the White House know that the First Lady and her two daughters, on a pretty annual basis around this time, will go on a ski trip out west with some family friends, and they\xe2\x80\x99re doing that again this year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like skiing? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President is looking forward to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Colorado is a swing state. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President is looking forward to a couple rounds of golf this weekend.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has General John Allen told the President he does not want to be nominated as NATO Supreme Commander?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked that question. \xc2\xa0I know that Secretary Panetta talked about this just a little bit yesterday. \xc2\xa0The President has appreciated the service of General Allen in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s coming off a 19-month tenure of service there, in a really pressure-packed situation. \xc2\xa0This was not -- a stressful role that he played. \xc2\xa0The President has relied on him quite a bit over the last 19 months as we\xe2\x80\x99ve navigated some very complicated issues, and again, initiated this drawdown of our men and women out of Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tGeneral Allen has said that, as he considers his next assignment, that he wanted to spend some time talking to his family about what he\xe2\x80\x99d like to do next. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that is understandable given what he\xe2\x80\x99s been up to the last 19 months. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to give him the opportunity to consider what he would like to do next.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut suffice it to say, the President has a ton of confidence in General Allen, not just because of the great work that he did over the last 19 months in Afghanistan, but because of the wisdom and advice that he shared with the President on a range of issues before that. \xc2\xa0So certainly, we\'d like to look for an opportunity for General Allen to continue his service to his country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President meet with General Allen to talk about his future?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\'s no meeting that I\'m aware of right now that\'s on the schedule. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\'s unclear whether he\'s going to take this NATO job or something else?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\'s something that he said that he would like the opportunity to discuss with his family. \xc2\xa0And we\'re certainly comfortable with his --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s on pause -- it\xe2\x80\x99s on hold until we hear more?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What is your sense of how much of the President\'s remarks today will be devoted to guns and gun violence and homicide in Chicago, et cetera?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I mentioned, the focus of the President\'s remarks today will be on the priority of building ladders of opportunity for those Americans who are scratching and clawing, trying to get into the middle class. \xc2\xa0So he\'ll talk about some of the initiatives that he discussed in the State of the Union and even some of the initiatives that he\'s talked about over the last couple of days. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHe\'ll talk about the difference that it would make to raise the minimum wage up to $9 an hour. \xc2\xa0This would literally mean the difference between a family of four whose head of household has a full-time, minimum wage job. \xc2\xa0Currently, the head of a household of four who has a full-time, minimum wage job is actually raising his family below the poverty line -- his or her family below the poverty line. \xc2\xa0So giving a raise to $9 an hour would have a real impact on the standard of living for families like that. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThis is why the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important to invest in high-quality early childhood education programs. \xc2\xa0We\'ve seen that investments like this for every dollar that we invest in these kinds of programs, we can save seven taxpayer dollars because of the impact it has on educational achievement down the road, because of the impact it has on things like teen pregnancy rates and even on violent crime rates.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President will talk primarily about some of these issues. \xc2\xa0But the other thing that\'s true -- and Secretary Duncan speaks about this very eloquently -- that our kids are not going to be successful in the classroom if they\'re scared of violence in their school. \xc2\xa0So the President is going to talk about -- in addition to these other policies that are critical to expanding economic opportunity, he\'s also going to talk about making our community safer. \xc2\xa0And one of the things that he\'ll also talk about are \xe2\x80\x9cpromise zones.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Promise zones are an idea where we can coordinate and integrate federal assistance to communities that are struggling both economically and otherwise.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo what we can do is we can devote resources from the Department of Justice to fund law enforcement programs. \xc2\xa0We can dedicate funding from HUD to expand housing options in these communities. \xc2\xa0We can dedicate money from the Department of Education to improve schools and to expand educational programs. \xc2\xa0Integrating all these programs is critical to offering a ladder of opportunity to the families that live there.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President really will be making an effort to focus on the economy, but trying to separate that completely from gun violence is impractical. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnybody else? \xc2\xa0Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t1:44 P.M. EST</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
