Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for an answer to a question (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.</p>\n<p>\n\t*The so-called \'doc fix\' is accounted for both in the President\'s proposal to the supercommittee and in his FY2012 budget but was not included in the American Jobs Act.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:52 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to the White House for your daily briefing on this chilly but glorious day outside.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou should have, if you check your inboxes, a statement from me on European Union actions targeting Iran and Syria.\xc2\xa0 We welcome today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by the European Union of new economic sanctions and other measures against both Iran and Syria.\xc2\xa0 The United States recently increased our own sanctions, as you know, on Iran, and today announced additional sanctions against Syrian officials and entities.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will not read the entire statement, but I encourage you to do so at your leisure.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will go to questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben Feller of The Associated Press.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple points on the debate in Congress.\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans are moving to include unemployment insurance, the extension, as part of their payroll tax bill, and of course that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President has been pushing for.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to the fact that they seem amenable to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly supports the extension of unemployment insurance benefits.\xc2\xa0 As you know, those additional benefits would not only help families very much in need of help, but that kind of assistance is judged by independent economists to be the most effective means of giving a boost to the economy, because folks who are unemployed are much more likely to spend the assistance that they get and inject it right back into the economy.\xc2\xa0 So, broadly speaking, the President, as you know, does support that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the overall Senate Republican proposal, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that they fall short, substantially, of what the President has put forward and what Senate Democrats have put forward on the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 The President has called for not just an extension of the existing 2 percent tax cut, but an expansion to 3.1 percent, which would give an average American family, working family next year, a $1,550 tax cut.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of money that can help Americans across the country make ends meet, put groceries on the table and in the refrigerator, make a car payment, a mortgage payment, help with school supplies and tuition payments.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xc2\xa0 They call for simply an extension of the existing 2 percent tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, the President has called for extending the payroll tax cut to small business.\xc2\xa0 Six million small businesses, nearly, would be helped by the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, which was also put forward by the Senate Democrats.\xc2\xa0 There is no assistance in the Senate Republican proposal for small businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the Senate Democratic bill does is ask that -- and this is supported, as you know, by broad majorities of the American people -- is ask that the wealthiest Americans, the wealthiest among us, pay a little bit more.</p>\n<p>\n\tApproximately 300,000 taxpayers, the most fortunate among us, 300,000, would be asked to pay a little bit more so that 160 million Americans would get a tax cut.\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do; Democrats think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And Congress -- Americans of all types think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 We urge Republicans in the Senate to vote accordingly when that bill comes to the floor either today or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the White House reaction to how the Republicans in their proposal yesterday would pay for the payroll tax?\xc2\xa0 They had several provisions; one of them was asking for the wealthy to simply donate money to draw down the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House thinks we can do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, I just want to note again that their proposal is not -- this is not an issue where they both put forward the same payroll tax cut the President has put forward, the Democrats have put forward.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something much more substantial for middle-class Americans and for small businesses.\xc2\xa0 Again, the Republicans offer no assistance to small businesses, no tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And we pay for it in a way that is broadly supported by the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would urge you not to be distracted by window dressing in the proposals that have come forward, in terms of pay-fors, by the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, is it\xe2\x80\x99s an unbalanced approach that would not and will not garner the same kind of support from the American people that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal has garnered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick question on Europe.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the White House yet react -- unless I missed it -- to one of the big ideas being talked about, which is a fiscal union of the countries so that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t only have united currency, but they would actually tie together their budgeting and spending policy -- obviously a big deal.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House supports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the White House comment on it and you won\xe2\x80\x99t today, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not an idea that I have heard discussed here in meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps you might address that question to the Treasury Secretary.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not something ever discussed here.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Reuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, are you -- is the White House, at least, encouraged by what the Republicans have been saying over the last two days on the payroll tax cut?\xc2\xa0 Boehner said today that he thinks that extending it would help the economy.\xc2\xa0 And even though you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with their pay-fors, they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a plan on that, and there seems to be an interest in extending it.\xc2\xa0 Are you finding there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there has been some progress, some movement.\xc2\xa0 Because as you heard over the weekend, one of the top Senate Republicans said he did not support an extension, just a simple extension of the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the Senate Majority Leader -- Minority Leader, rather, only a few days ago, said it would have no positive economic benefit.\xc2\xa0 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s saying it would.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not just because we\xe2\x80\x99re saying it.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not just because the President is saying it and the administration is saying it, but because they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing it from the American people.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re hearing it from businesses who would be helped not just by the President\xe2\x80\x99s small business tax cut, but by the expanded tax cut to 160 million Americans who would then use that money to pay bills, to make purchases, and thereby boost the economy, and cause it to grow and cause businesses to hire.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear that they are still not proposing -- setting aside pay-fors -- they are still not proposing what the President believes is the right remedy for the economy, the right medicine, if you will, which is not just to extend the tax cut but to expand it, make it bigger.\xc2\xa0 This year, 160 million Americans got on average an extra $1,000 in their paychecks because of that tax cut that the President and Republicans agreed to and the President signed into law a year ago.\xc2\xa0 That will expire, resulting in taxes going up if nothing is done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this year now, the President believes for 2012 that tax cut ought to be expanded, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the surest way we can assist the economy, help it grow, and help it create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And then, of course, he\xe2\x80\x99s added something that Republicans apparently do not support, which is -- even though numerous leading Republicans said in the past that they would support a payroll tax cut for small businesses, they have not included that in their proposals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you seeing a basis for compromise?\xc2\xa0 You say it falls short, but do you see a basis for compromise?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s been progress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on a vote that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take place either today or tomorrow in the Senate on a bill that we believe is the right medicine, that we believe gives the kind of support to American taxpayers that they deserve as we continue to emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 We urge Republicans to vote for it, to hear the voices of their constituents who support it and who support the way it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for as proposed by Democrats and as supported by the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf and when that vote comes to pass and does not clear the bar established by opposition, we can discuss what other means there are to getting to the solution which is necessary, which is the assistance through tax cuts that the American people deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic quickly:\xc2\xa0 Was the White House or the President informed ahead of time about the central bank action to stem the European crisis?\xc2\xa0 And what does the President think about that action?\xc2\xa0 Is he consulting closely with the Federal Reserve on these actions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t talk much about the Fed from the podium here.\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Department might have a statement.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if Secretary Geithner or the Treasury Department put out a statement on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything further for you on it from the podium.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President doing to make anything come through either this evening or tomorrow, when this vote is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re clearly succeeding in that there\xe2\x80\x99s progress, Ann, that Republicans have gone in a few short days from opposing an extension and arguing that it would have no positive economic impact, against the assembled evidence of independent economists everywhere, to grudgingly agreeing that this is the right thing to do, to give tax cuts to middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 So we must be doing something right, or at the very least our arguments are being echoed by average Americans across the country who want this assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President continues to consult with his team, continues to have his team have conversations with relevant members and staff on the Hill as we push this forward; obviously, working with Senator Reid in the Senate to move the Senate Democratic proposal forward.\xc2\xa0 And we hope and expect that, in the end, we will get the kind of tax relief for middle-class Americans that they deserve in this economic situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq, where Vice President Biden was today, Camp Victory shuts down tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Would President Obama consider ever sending back into Iraq trainers or others to help the Iraqi government -- the Iraqi --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, Ann, as you know, that we expect to have a relationship, and a full one, with Iraq going forward; the kind of relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s built on economic ties, diplomatic ties, as well as security ties, that we have with sovereign nations elsewhere in the region and around the globe.\xc2\xa0 What form that would take, or might take, is going to be a matter of discussion and agreement between the Iraqi government and the United States government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what is happening now, as has been noted in the stories coming out of Iraq, is that we are now witnessing the fulfillment of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to end the war in Iraq responsibly, to keep his commitment -- and the commitment of the previous president -- to draw down all U.S. forces by the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 That is happening.\xc2\xa0 I believe we\xe2\x80\x99re down to something like 15,000 now, and they will be out by December 31st.\xc2\xa0 And that is a very important commitment for the American people as well as this President.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move to the back.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, House Republicans have been working on a series of regulatory reform bills over the last few weeks, and more votes ahead.\xc2\xa0 Is it time -- and these are supported by the U.S. Chamber and others, businesses, that they say would help create jobs -- is it time for a regulatory reform bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically which bills you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 This President\xe2\x80\x99s record on regulatory reform is quite significant.\xc2\xa0 The look-back that he instituted to ensure that the regulations that are on the books are as efficient as possible, and the ones that are no longer useful or effective are removed -- I can cite the studies that have been made that demonstrate that there actually have been fewer and less costly regulations put in place by this administration in its first two and a half years than in the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 So we work very aggressively to ensure that we take the necessary action to protect our air and water and that we also issue regulations and reform regulations in a way that makes them as efficient as possible.<br/>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republican -- Senate Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 plan has a component to pay for it through means testing for millionaires.\xc2\xa0 And are they on to something here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was referring to as sort of a little -- to pick your metaphor -- window dressing or gorilla dust.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fraction, as they admit, of what their pay-fors are, what the foundation of their pay-for is basically a violation of the very agreement they made just a few short months ago.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of stuff that drives Americans crazy about Washington, where you sign a deal, you have an agreement -- bipartisan agreement, then you change your mind a few months later, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with the sequester or with non-defense discretionary spending -- which, I would remind you, through the Budget Control Act, in the agreement reached in a bipartisan fashion and signed by this President into law, brings non-defense discretionary spending down to its lowest levels since Eisenhower was President.\xc2\xa0 And we all like Ike.\xc2\xa0 And that is a deal that has been signed and should be adhered to.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis, and then Jessica.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Senator McConnell asserted yesterday that the country needs the extension of the payroll tax, and perhaps the UI extension, because Obama\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies have failed.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the idea that these extensions or expansions are needed because his policies have failed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What my reaction is, is that the policies that got us to the worst recession since the Great Depression obviously preceded this President coming into office; in fact, the economy was in a dramatic freefall when this President was sworn in.\xc2\xa0 As you well know, and as every American with a brain in his head knows, this economy was in collapse when President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that he took, working with Congress, saved us from a depression, saved the auto industry in this country from collapse and the loss of another million-plus jobs in addition to the 8 million that were lost as a result of the recession.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actions that he took we firmly believe have set this economy back in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 It has been growing steadily now for a number of quarters and it has been creating private sector jobs, over 2.5 million.\xc2\xa0 Not enough when the hole is as deep as this recession caused, but the direction is the right direction.\xc2\xa0 The direction that we had when we got here was very dramatically the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Bill.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, wait, I did say Jessica, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration apologized to Pakistan for the NATO airstrikes that killed about two dozen soldiers.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Let me say, we expressed our condolences to Pakistan about the regrettable loss of life.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an issue between a headline and a story that I think needs to be clarified.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you tease out why that distinction is important?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things.\xc2\xa0 One --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the distinction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of fact that I, speaking for the White House and the President, offered condolences on behalf of him, the administration, the American people, for the tragic loss of life -- and it was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have launched an investigation through CENTCOM, as well as ISAF, to find out exactly what transpired.\xc2\xa0 But -- maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m preempting what your question was, but there was obviously no apology and there was an expression of condolences.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is it important that no one from this podium and from this White House issue an apology?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are in the middle of an investigation -- actually, at the early stages of an investigation -- into what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the expression of condolences for tragic loss of life conveys a sincere sentiment about our feelings, the President\xe2\x80\x99s feelings and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and it goes to the importance of the relationship that we have with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 But we have to be clear about what -- the premise of your question is established as we move on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question was going to be, why was the apology -- as I was going to phrase it -- was from Secretary of State Clinton, not the President.\xc2\xa0 But let me just cut to it, cut through this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I spoke -- I said very clearly from here that -- on behalf of the President and the entire administration, that the expression of condolences was forthcoming.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we all know what the subtext of a lot of this is.\xc2\xa0 And there was a report this morning that there may be domestic politics in play.\xc2\xa0 So can you just address that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is utter nonsense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s what --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I can just tell you that the problem with the story that you reference is that somebody wrote a headline that had no bearing on the actual story.\xc2\xa0 The story discussed the decision to express our condolences, which is not what\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the headline.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just follow, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did say -- oh, no, Bill.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the President accused the Republicans of playing politics with the payroll tax issue, but how is it that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing the same thing and that you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing the same thing from this podium?\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a plan that Democrats have, which is not likely to make it through the Senate in the end, and neither is theirs likely to make it anywhere.\xc2\xa0 So there must be politics involved here, because --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s Washington, so obviously this is a political process when you have members of both parties in Congress having differing opinions about what the right course of action is here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what the President has put forward and Senate Democrats have put forward is what he and they believe is the right course of action, and it happens to be very much in sync with what the American people believe is the right course of action.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I have certainly allowed for the fact that that measure may not pass, and that if it does not pass we will move forward and try to find a way to reach an agreement that ensures that the American people, 160 million of them, get the kind of tax relief that this President firmly believes they deserve and need next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we will get to that point, if it so comes to pass.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously believe and hope that Republicans -- and there has been some signs of movement among a handful of Republicans on this issue -- that Republicans will, if you will, come to their senses, hear the voices of their constituents, and say, on balance, it is worth giving 160 million American taxpayers a tax cut of $1,500 by asking 300,000 taxpayers to pay a little extra.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s agreed.\xc2\xa0 My question is how can he accuse them of playing politics --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s not even --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can he with a straight face accuse them of playing politics, granted you both want the same thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say is the President has been utterly consistent in his support for this proposal and his argument about why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been an important component of the American Jobs Act since the day he laid it on the table, and he has argued for it ever since.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have heard in just a few days is a lot of different points of view not just from Republicans, but sometimes from the very same Republican in a matter of hours or days about whether or not they even support giving tax cuts to the middle class here in America.\xc2\xa0 So I think that consistency on one side, fluctuation and variation on the other, you tell me where the politics is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we care most about is not how they get there or why, but that in the end the majority -- or rather 60 percent -- of Senate Republicans agree to give the kind of tax relief to the American people that they deserve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why not go at them with a plan that you know they\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to accept --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because the fact of the matter is if the President had not put this in the American Jobs Act and had not fought for it every day and every week, sometimes to the consternation of people who have been hearing the same message so frequently, we might not even be debating this.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, given that the number-two Senate Republican said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even for it just four days ago, if the President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t put it on the table, you think the Republicans would have?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they would have.\xc2\xa0 So it is because of the leadership of the President, because of the agreement of Senate Democrats and the consistency of our message that we are where we are and we believe we will get a payroll tax cut for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, we will get a payroll tax cut for small businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s how this town works, as you know even better than I, Bill, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering it longer than I did.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s called leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not likely to come out of the hides of the millionaires, as the President and you keep suggesting.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the American people suggest is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Henry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Housing Secretary is on the Hill today, talking about the crisis; it\xe2\x80\x99s still obviously very difficult for a lot of Americans.\xc2\xa0 In February \xe2\x80\x9809, the President promised that his housing plan would help refinance between 7 and 9 million homes to prevent foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 I checked with the officials today who oversee this.\xc2\xa0 They say 894,000 people have refinanced under that program.\xc2\xa0 What happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the size of the problem is significant, as you know.\xc2\xa0 The housing bubble burst and caused a situation where a vast number of American homeowners saw their mortgages go underwater, the values of their home go lower than the cost of their mortgage.\xc2\xa0 And this President has taken actions steadily since he took office to help those homeowners get into a better financial system with regards to their mortgages -- financial situation, rather.\xc2\xa0 And there have been a number of steps taken, including those this year, this summer and fall, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep looking for ways to improve it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, is the situation a problem and is it -- is the problem quite large, the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this President has been so focused on taking every step he can -- small, medium and large -- to try to assist homeowners who, with a little help, either through refinancing or other measures, can meet their payments and keep their homes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of those actions he took:\xc2\xa0 October 24th, he went to Nevada, and he said, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to move forward with executive -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wait for Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I checked with the housing officials as well, and they say, this morning that actually today, December 1st, is the first day you can apply for that program the President talked about October 24th.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in fairness, you can\xe2\x80\x99t really get any statistics on how many people have refinanced.\xc2\xa0 But my question would be, how can the President go out on October 24th and say, we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move, and here we are on December 1st and the officials are saying that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because he launched --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it won\xe2\x80\x99t have an impact until the first quarter of 2012.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He made an executive action on October 24th, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the day -- my mother\xe2\x80\x99s birthday -- (laughter) -- hi, mom -- (laughter) -- I hope I called her.\xc2\xa0 I hope I called.\xc2\xa0 The President took that action, it was an executive action, and he launched a process that results, any day now -- December -- if it is today, I believe you may be right -- that will now allow homeowners to take advantage of this executive action.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it would -- these things take a little time.\xc2\xa0 But five weeks is a pretty short period of time for something like this to get up and running and to be ready, as I believe it is now, or almost is, for homeowners to find out whether or not they qualify.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s, again, small actions, medium actions, large actions -- whatever it takes, within his authority, working with Congress or just using his executive authority to assist homeowners deal with this very difficult situation that persists.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 February 2009 as well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember on Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s fine network, the President told Matt Lauer -- Republicans bring this up a lot -- that the President said, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the economy turned around in three years, this is going to be a one-term proposition.\xc2\xa0 Last night, at one of the fundraisers in New York, he was saying, look, these problems are so large, you might need more than one term; you might need another -- down the road, it might need more than one presidency.\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to buy more time to get the economy turned around when he says that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to buy time for somebody beyond 2016, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President believes that the actions that he and other leaders in Washington took in the face of the worst economic crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had since the 1930s did reverse the freefall, did begin a process where the economy is growing again, did begin a process where it\xe2\x80\x99s been steadily creating private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is much more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And he is eager to do that work -- with Congress, without Congress, whatever it takes to get it done.\xc2\xa0 But it is a big job -- 8 million jobs lost is a substantial number and it requires the focus and diligence of the President, of members of Congress, of other leaders in Washington and around the country to tackle because it is so big.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s completely up for the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tLesley.\xc2\xa0 And then Mara, and then Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 On Saturday --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- you, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And your fine network.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Saturday, it will mark two years since the American contractor Alan Gross has been held in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 His wife has been rather vocally critical of the administration in recent days as it comes up to the anniversary.\xc2\xa0 She said that the President has sort of -- the administration has kept its hands off it.\xc2\xa0 Can you address that, and does the President intend to mark it at any occasion on Saturday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I apologize, if you had given me a heads-up I would have looked into this before I got here, but I would have to check on that.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat order did I say?\xc2\xa0 Mara.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer talking about -- fighting about whether the payroll tax should be extended, we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting about whether it should be expanded and how to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 Could you clarify when you said the means testing of federal benefits was window dressing -- is the President against means testing, or just because it\xe2\x80\x99s a violation of the (inaudible) agreement?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, the pay-fors they put forward will require a change in the caps, a reduction in the caps agreed to in the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the violation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the means testing aspect of it is.\xc2\xa0 What I do know is that it\xe2\x80\x99s window dressing because it\xe2\x80\x99s a very small portion of what their pay-fors would be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not saying he\xe2\x80\x99s against means testing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The majority of -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- no, he\xe2\x80\x99s not saying that.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not saying he\xe2\x80\x99s for this proposal because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really had a chance to look at it that much.\xc2\xa0 What is important, though, is that it is window dressing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But the second question about the pay-fors -- I mean, I know you want this fight to go on and on and on --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No!\xc2\xa0 No!\xc2\xa0 We want it to pass tonight or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, but one of the other pay-fors that they suggest, in addition to the millionaires can donate their money to the deficit, is they want to extend the President\xe2\x80\x99s own federal hiring and pay freeze.\xc2\xa0 Are you for that?\xc2\xa0 Are you open to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there was an agreement, as you guys covered very closely this summer, called the Budget Control Act, that set caps in discretionary spending -- non-defense and defense -- that required very significant cuts, reductions in non-defense discretionary spending that bring us down to the lowest level relative to the size of the economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this would violate that, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This would violate that.\xc2\xa0 And it would result in -- because their proposal says you would have to lower the caps.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t violate it, it just increases it, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It means that you prevent -- yes, it lowers the caps more so that you cut energy, you cut education, you cut Head Start -- you cut all the things -- so, in other words, rather than ask 300,000 American taxpayers, millionaires and billionaires, to pay a little bit extra, you stick it to the very people you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help through the payroll tax cut -- by violating the Budget Control Act that you voted for and agreed to just a few short months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question to follow up on Jessica\xe2\x80\x99s mischievous inquiry about the apology.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Are you ruling out an apology, or are you just saying it\xe2\x80\x99s premature because you haven\xe2\x80\x99t finished the investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that there is an investigation that has just been launched by CENTCOM and that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- we need to find the results of this investigation.\xc2\xa0 We have offered our condolences.\xc2\xa0 We have called it what it is, a tragic loss of life.\xc2\xa0 And we anticipate results of the investigation to come when they\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\xc2\xa0 And for now --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the question of whether we should apologize or not is too early, is premature?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge actions we might take -- what we might say in the future.\xc2\xa0 I think the whole issue that you raise was brought up through a faulty headline that is not even reflected in the story.\xc2\xa0 The whole discussion here was about the expression of condolences.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe Laura is next, then Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Did you have one?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did.\xc2\xa0 My question is about the confirmation of Richard Cordray, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could tell me what the administration is doing right now to try to make that happen, including --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Fighting tooth and nail to make it happen, because the -- we need that consumer watchdog in place to fully implement the Wall Street reforms that this President fought so hard working with members of Congress to get passed in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.\xc2\xa0 And we call on Congress to pass, and not try to stall that confirmation, or reject that confirmation, of a man who is unbelievably qualified and supported by Republicans, but yet, apparently, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see, not so much that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to vote for him because they want to water down the kind of Wall Street reform that this President fought for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as you well know, in order to get something through the Senate, you need Republican support.\xc2\xa0 So what are you doing -- what is the White House doing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been lobbying like crazy to get Republican support for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what does that lobbying look like?\xc2\xa0 Are you having one-on-one meetings with the Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Are you doing direct outreach to individuals?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, this has been going on, as you know, far too long.\xc2\xa0 He should have been confirmed --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now?\xc2\xa0 As I understand it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if anybody is on the phone right now, but we have been working very -- we have folks who go up to the Hill, we have folks who call key staffers and key senators, and we hope that they would vote to confirm Mr. Cordray because he\xe2\x80\x99s the right man for the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the White House is doing direct, specific outreach to individual members?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at this moment or what\xe2\x80\x99s happened today, but there has been direct outreach, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not really -- I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play lawyer here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not really talking about like this moment or today, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about at this moment --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, has there been an effort, a direct contact with senators, urging them to vote for and explaining why they should vote for Richard Cordray, the answer is yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With Republicans, as well as Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You called their proposal to pay for it unbalanced.\xc2\xa0 What makes it unbalanced?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the solution of cutting education and energy, and the kind of programs that often, in large measure, help the very people that are supposed to be assisted by a middle-class tax cut for 160 million working Americans makes it unbalanced.\xc2\xa0 The reason why the American people support the approach the President takes, the approach -- which is similar to the approach, and supported by the President, and similar to the approach that Senate Democrats take -- is because they look at the 300,000 wealthiest taxpayers in America and say, they should be asked to pay a little more, pay their fair share to help give 160 million Americans a tax cut -- 160 million Americans, on average, for the American family, $1,550 in tax cuts; nearly 6 million small businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you know what happens when you give small businesses a break like that?\xc2\xa0 If passed, I think this would be the 18th tax cut, or tax relief, form of tax relief, that this President would have made law.\xc2\xa0 And it encourages businesses to hire people, to grow, to invest.\xc2\xa0 And that causes economic growth and causes job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some Republicans, though, that say a balanced approach is a little bit of what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do with the millionaires, but also offering a lot more cuts.\xc2\xa0 So why not offer them some more cuts to actually try to sort of breach this divide?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear -- let\xe2\x80\x99s have the vote.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear what we think is the right approach.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Democrats have made clear what they think is the right approach, and we support that.\xc2\xa0 And we support it because it is balanced -- because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rob Peter to pay Paul.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think it\xe2\x80\x99s balanced, they don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s balanced.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, and I\xe2\x80\x99m comforted by the millions of people behind me and us, the President, who support it, in the form of the majority of the American people who support our balanced approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you\xe2\x80\x99re right that thus far in this process, in the debates over the American Jobs Act in whole and its provisions, that Republicans have, Senate Republicans have unfortunately staked out a position that is at odds with the vast majority of the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to fight for those provisions.\xc2\xa0 We got one through.\xc2\xa0 We hope to get the payroll cut tax -- payroll tax cut, and extension and expansion through.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep fighting for the other provisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the President going to be playing a more personal role in this now next week, when this thing fails?\xc2\xa0 Is that fair to say?\xc2\xa0 In the Senate -- when the Senate --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran and Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.\xc2\xa0 And then -- yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck sort of stole my thunder.\xc2\xa0 I had a domestic and a foreign policy question.\xc2\xa0 But following up on that, what I wanted to ask is, is the President going to engage personally, not on the stump, but in terms of the negotiations?\xc2\xa0 Or was the lesson from the summer of the debt ceiling sort of, this is a nightmare, don\xe2\x80\x99t get involved, let Congress do it?\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask my foreign policy question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He might.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He might what?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Engage personally.\xc2\xa0 I think he -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- look, the President does have conversations with leaders and members of Congress, and he will continue to have those.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate he will have some such conversations in the coming days and weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on that note, we have been talking about the end of the year, but is there a date at which everyone\xe2\x80\x99s paychecks get screwed up?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the date?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would ask Treasury, but I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s January 1st that the payroll tax cut expires at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Taxes begin -- you get hit right away.\xc2\xa0 Taxes go up the next time you get a paycheck.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just -- this is not the right time to do that to hardworking middle-class and working-class Americans, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is still a fragile time in our economy.\xc2\xa0 Outside independent economists have said very clearly that payroll tax cut extension and expansion has a very positive impact on economic growth and on job creation, as does the extension of it to small businesses.\xc2\xa0 So we cannot let this process result in a vote that raises taxes on middle-class Americans because a section of Congress not supported by the majority of the American people wants to protect the tax benefits of 300,000 Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Turkey, the Vice President is there.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama believe that Turkey is doing enough with regard to Iran?\xc2\xa0 I know with Syria, they\xe2\x80\x99ve come forward this week in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s been really helpful to the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s policy.\xc2\xa0 But is President Obama and is Vice President Biden asking Turkey to take additional steps on Iran?\xc2\xa0 And what do they need to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would maybe take part of your question in terms of what specifically the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations will be like in Turkey or the messages that he\xe2\x80\x99s carrying.\xc2\xa0 I mean, broadly, on Iran we have been very focused on and pleased by the international consensus that has been developed over these several years to sanction Iran, to pressure and isolate Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that continues today, as I announced at the top of the briefing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran and Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think I said you.\xc2\xa0 Tell me your name again?\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tejinder Singh.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you please confirm -- following up on Jessica\xe2\x80\x99s question -- that the White House received an advice from the American diplomats in Pakistan asking for an apology?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would encourage you to read that story, because although the headline said one thing, the story said something else.\xc2\xa0 There was a suggestion from our embassy in Pakistan that a message of expressing condolences be taped.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, but I personally got up here and expressed condolences on behalf of the President and the American people.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Panetta has done the same thing.\xc2\xa0 So that message has been delivered.\xc2\xa0 But, again, the headline is at odds with the story.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you expect Pakistan --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect Pakistan to reopen the border soon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, we certainly are working with Pakistan on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We urge them to attend the conference in Bonn, and are working with them on our overall relationship.\xc2\xa0 We understand that this is complicated by events, as has been the case at various times this year.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s an important relationship that we continue to work on, because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the American people and our national security that we continue to work on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Carrie, and then, yes, Connie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about the President\xe2\x80\x99s AIDS speech this morning.\xc2\xa0 He said he was going to refocus the fight on AIDS domestically, given how great is the constant over the last decade.\xc2\xa0 Is that an indication that his predecessor, Bush, who focused a lot on the AIDS fight internationally, didn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough domestically?\xc2\xa0 And does he -- will he -- and in addition to that, does he plan to reach beyond what Bush did, at some point, internationally, in terms of fighting --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you may be reading too much into this.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the positive things about today\xe2\x80\x99s event was how bipartisan it was.\xc2\xa0 President Bush participated; President Obama obviously did.\xc2\xa0 The announcements that he made build on the work that President Bush did on this very important issue.\xc2\xa0 And I would not take the steps that he\xe2\x80\x99s announcing, in terms of domestic tackling of this problem, as criticism, but just simply the right step to take at the right time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to go beyond what President Bush did internationally?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to anticipate what he may or may not do in the future.\xc2\xa0 I just want to celebrate what he announced today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he talk with President Bush today?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe President Bush was speaking from a remote location.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I do not know that they spoke.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Connie, and then --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pakistan and then Iraq, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go real fast.\xc2\xa0 How many more billions does the U.S. plan to give to Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have a program of assistance to Pakistan that is reviewed all the time, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no plan -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure I understand the question.\xc2\xa0 But the -- we work with Pakistan; it\xe2\x80\x99s an important, sometimes complicated relationship, and it\xe2\x80\x99s, as I just mentioned, vital to our national security that we continue to have that kind of cooperative relationship, especially in the fight against terror.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq, why does the U.S. need 16,000 diplomats in Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a vital -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s 16,000, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant civilian presence -- it will be -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s an important relationship in an important region of the world that requires the kind of contacts at the economic, scientific, education, diplomatic level that a significant embassy presence and consulate presence demonstrates and represents.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s an important relationship.\xc2\xa0 It is now a relationship that is changing, because we have, as the President promised, ended the war responsibly in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re bringing home the last of our men and women in uniform, and we are moving forward with a comprehensive relationship with Iraq that we hope will lead to significant cooperation in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Iran and the British, do you have any comment on the rupture of diplomatic relations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing more.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the AIDS day issue --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, and then you.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the AIDS day issue, did this White House look at any chance, any ways of working with HHS in trying to push more anti-retrovirals out for more AIDS patients and HIV patients?\xc2\xa0 Is that something you\xe2\x80\x99re still looking at?\xc2\xa0 Did you look at it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 And I think we put out a significant paper on this, very detailed, that may go to the issue you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer from here in terms of the specifics and the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.\xc2\xa0 So I would just either point you to HHS or I would start with the paper that we put out and then go to HHS for more details.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect something beyond today, since the President really emphasized that the numbers are climbing here versus in other places around the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s why he directed $50 million in funding for domestic HIV/AIDS treatment and care using existing funds, but an additional $50 million for treatment and care of HIV and AIDS patients.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToshi.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Tell me your name again.\xc2\xa0 I know we spoke.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Richard.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Richard, okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Next week, the Kenyan Prime Minister will be in town to sign a new comprehensive border security deal.\xc2\xa0 Nine months negotiation, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty fast these days.\xc2\xa0 Is there any new terrorist threat that would justify such a fast signing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would urge you to come back to me with that question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that visit next week.\xc2\xa0 But maybe our folks at the National Security Council can help you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToshi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just this week an international organization called OECD in Paris predicted that the eurozone economy is now entering a recession now.\xc2\xa0 And do you have any concern that a European recession could drag the U.S. economy down to a recession again?\xc2\xa0 And given the context, are you satisfied with the European response to the crisis?\xc2\xa0 There was a meeting on Monday, but are you satisfied and confident on the process?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, we believe that the Europeans have it within their capacity to deal with this problem and that they need to do so conclusively and quickly.\xc2\xa0 They have taken some positive steps.\xc2\xa0 They obviously need to take some more steps.\xc2\xa0 And we are advising and consulting with them given our significant experience on matters similar to this.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding your question about the OECD and the economic headwinds created by Europe, they are a concern, as this President has said and Secretary Geithner and others, Dr. Krueger who was here with me just a few days ago, which only reinforces why we need to act so aggressively on the things that we can control directly, like cutting taxes for 160 million Americans here at home, expanding that tax cut in 2012, expanding it for individuals and expanding it to small businesses.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kind of steps we can take that will help our economy grow, will help it create jobs and will insulate us from potential future shocks whether they come from Europe, or as they did earlier this year from Japan, or the Middle East.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we need to take the action that we can take.\xc2\xa0 And obviously this President believes that we should be doing more than just extending and expanding the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 We should be passing other elements of the American Jobs Act, like the assistance to states to hire back teachers who have been laid off.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you get a -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a double positive impact.\xc2\xa0 You put teachers back to work, and having them back in the classroom helps our kids prepare for a future in the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo additional measures include infrastructure funding to put construction workers back to work rebuilding our infrastructure, which also has a long-term positive impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 So we need to do the things we can that we can control to help us grow, to help us create jobs, and to insulate us from the kinds of economic shocks that we know happen because that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of global economy we live in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Julia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Among the pieces of legislation that are set to expire at the end of the year, one of them is the doc fix that would -- calls doctors if you paid less, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s 27 percent less for Medicare reimbursements.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House has pushed members of Congress to pass, or are they less concerned about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe that they fixed the doc fix, the SGR, we had a comprehensive fix to that -- and check me on this -- but in the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 Now, obviously this is something that in a bipartisan fashion has been addressed in the past and needs to be addressed going forward.*</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So now -- the time is coming up, the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- are people making phone calls on it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you as concerned about that not being fixed as you would be something like unemployment insurance and payroll tax cuts?\xc2\xa0 Is it getting the same amount of attention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the bill that\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the floor in the Senate that if all were right in the world, or at least in this country, would be passed overwhelmingly with votes from members of both parties so that we can provide that vital tax cut to the American people and to small businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t have just one priority, and fixing that is a concern and a priority that we have shared I think in a bipartisan way since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:40 P.M.
