EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Miami, where tomorrow, the President will visit the National Hurricane Center to receive the annual hurricane briefing and tour the center.\xc2\xa0 The meeting will showcase mapping tools developed by federal agencies that better inform and involve the public in preparedness and response activities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will also take the opportunity to speak on how climate change will mean more intense hurricanes, and rising sea levels will result in more flooding and damage from the storms.\xc2\xa0 He will also address how he is committed to combatting climate change both here at home and leading abroad, and assisting our communities in preparing for these storms.</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the clean water rules that were finalized and announced today, the House has already passed a bill to block those rules from taking effect and the Senate is considering doing the same thing.\xc2\xa0 Would the President veto that if it cleared Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on legislation that it\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely clear that it will pass.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that we believe the rule today is a win-win, both for the economy and for public health.\xc2\xa0 This is a rule that will protect streams and wetlands that form the foundation of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s water resources.\xc2\xa0 They feed the rivers, lakes, bays and coastal waters that our health and economy depend on.</p>\n<p>I think, as many of you have reported, protection for about 60 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s streams and millions of acres of wetlands has been confusing and complex as a result of several recent Supreme Court decisions.\xc2\xa0 And so the rule we announced today protects the streams and wetlands that are scientifically shown to have the greatest impact on downstream water quality and form the foundation of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s water resources.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of farmers and others, businesses and others are complaining about the cost that would be imposed on them by this.\xc2\xa0 What cost estimates does the administration have for the financial cost that they would bear?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Zero.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that this rule has no direct cost to a community, business or individual.\xc2\xa0 It only applies if someone is going to pollute or destroy a body of water and needs a permit.\xc2\xa0 So money and time will actually be saved by all involved because we will not have to deal with long, drawn-out, case-by-case basis for those determinations.\xc2\xa0 Any cost would come from applying for permits and complying with the rule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s immigration ruling -- we got the White House reaction to it, but can you give us a sense of what your plans are now going forward based on that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, as I think many of you have noted, there\xe2\x80\x99s an important hearing scheduled for July 6th at which the Department of Justice is preparing its arguments on the legal merits of the executive actions that the President announced last fall.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice remains focused on that argument, and that hearing is proceeding on an expedited basis.</p>\n<p>In terms of the ruling from yesterday, I can tell you that Department of Justice lawyers continue to review that ruling, as do lawyers here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any next steps to announce for you at this time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a totally separate issue, can you give us your reaction to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s action today on FIFA or the Soccer Federation?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have much of a reaction from the White House for you on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, those decisions are made by career prosecutors at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, this has been an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s been in the works for some time.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Attorney General answered a host of questions earlier today on this, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add from the White House on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is a big sports fan.\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to him about it?\xc2\xa0 What does he think about it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He is a big sports fan, but I have not had a chance to ask him about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House looped in at all on this investigation before it was announced?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I know that sometimes we do get a heads-up on high-profile cases like this, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that happened this time or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Monday is the deadline for when the travel restrictions are lifted on the five Taliban detainees that were exchanged for Bowe Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have concerns that they will again be able to travel freely?\xc2\xa0 And what are you doing to address them?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do remain in close contact with our partners to mitigate the threat that might be posed by former detainees.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a general rule that we operate by.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific conversations to read out to you in regards to the folks that you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing, but I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we and our partners remain vigilant and in close contact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on FIFA, did the President know about the investigation?\xc2\xa0 Was he briefed on the investigation by Loretta Lynch?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can I ask you about the fundraisers today?\xc2\xa0 Is this trip primarily a fundraising trip, or what is the primary reason for actually going down to Miami and actually getting the hurricane briefing in person?\xc2\xa0 Is that just sort of tacked on to what looks like more of a fundraising event?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Toluse, you are so cynical.\xc2\xa0 The hurricane briefing is actually an annual briefing that the President gets</p>\n<p>-- has gotten every year in office.\xc2\xa0 We thought that this year it would be appropriate to go down to the Hurricane Center in person, take a look at a lot of the new technologies they\xe2\x80\x99ve been employing, both that\xe2\x80\x99s available to them but also that has been released to the public in terms of the new data sets, new levels -- new sets of transparency that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place down there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that a lot of communities are already feeling the effects of climate change, and the President tomorrow is going to be talking about the steps that both the federal government and local communities have taken to prepare.\xc2\xa0 For example, over the next five years, Miami Beach will spend over $400 million to complete neighborhood drainage projects that will alleviate chronic street-level flooding and reduce public property flooding concerns.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot happening both at the local level and also at the national level to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is going to be the fifth and sixth fundraising event of the month after doing none in April and only a couple earlier in the year.\xc2\xa0 Is the President ramping up his fundraising, and should we expect to see many more fundraisers in the next couple of months?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Toluse, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pace to me that sounds consistent with past years.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President is also head of the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 He takes that responsibility seriously to make sure that candidates and campaigns have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about Greece?\xc2\xa0 With the G7 coming up, how big of an issue in terms of potential drag on the U.S. economy is the situation in Greece, and what is the White House planning to do about that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Toluse, this is a situation that we do watch very closely.\xc2\xa0 Principally, the Treasury Secretary is our point person within the administration who watches this and engages on it.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to read out to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President made any specific calls, or has he engaged personally?\xc2\xa0 Or is it mostly Secretary Lew that\xe2\x80\x99s doing the work?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President is absolutely kept up to date.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any international calls to read out to you, but you might want to check with the Treasury Department on their latest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you able to get any more of a readout from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting between the President and the NATO Secretary General?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Jeff -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what we were able to release yesterday in terms of what the two of them discussed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which was minimal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s your take, then yes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To go back to the Hurricane Center tomorrow for a second -- will this be his first visit there to the National Hurricane Center?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so all of his other briefings have been in Washington or the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And, Darlene, the Hurricane Center is located on the Florida International Campus, a university that is part of the Florida Climate Institute.\xc2\xa0 This institute is a multi-disciplinary network of all the major research universities in Florida -- international research and public organizations, scientists, and individuals concerned with achieving a better understanding of climate variability and change.\xc2\xa0 So it seems very worthwhile for the President to travel down there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, there\xe2\x80\x99s a hearing on the House lawsuit dealing with the White House\xe2\x80\x99s actions on the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House watching this lawsuit at all, have any concerns about this lawsuit?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a House hearing, or a court hearing?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Court hearing.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have made very clear that we believe the -- let me start again.\xc2\xa0 One of the President\xe2\x80\x99s main pledges when running as a candidate in 2007 and 2008 was to expand health care for all Americans, and to make sure that affordable, quality health care was affordable for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 That process of building that legislation was not always a pretty one, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that ended up with a piece of legislation that the President is very proud of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Over 16 million people now have health care.\xc2\xa0 Women are no longer discriminated against.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no longer discrimination for preexisting conditions.\xc2\xa0 Young adults can stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plan.\xc2\xa0 So we are very proud of the Affordable Care Act, notwithstanding Republican partisan attempts to dismantle it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the USA Freedom Act, is there any movement on that?\xc2\xa0 Has there been any interactions between the White House and Capitol Hill leaders to fix what the President has said is a national security threat?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right, the President did have a chance yesterday to share with you his sense of urgency around this issue.\xc2\xa0 Clearly the path forward is for the Senate to go ahead and pass the USA Freedom Act.\xc2\xa0 This was a piece of legislation, mind you, that garnered 338 votes in the House of Representatives from both Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 As students of Washington, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree with me that not a lot of things get 338 votes across bipartisan lines in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 So we feel strongly this is something that the Senate should take up very quickly and pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one question quickly on Ramadi.\xc2\xa0 There was news about continued suicide attacks, as well as the news about the Iraqi counteroffensive.\xc2\xa0 Do you have an update on sort of where the battle stands there?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 For any detailed assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on on the ground, I would refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 I can say that we are encouraged by Iraqi forces mobilizing at the order of the Prime Minister and are now beginning to push back to retake parts of Anbar Province in coordination with the Popular Mobilization Forces and local Sunni fighters.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Iraqis have suffered setbacks before but were able to retake territory from ISIL such as in Baghdadi and in Western Anbar last February.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we have said all along that there will be ebbs and flows on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And while we understand the serious nature of what happened in Ramadi, setbacks like this will occur.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since we are going to Florida, is there any update on negotiations between the administration and Governor Rick Scott over expanding Medicaid?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on that, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 I would check with the Department of Health and Human Services.\xc2\xa0 But I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth reminding all of us of Governor Scott\xe2\x80\x99s original position which was when he supported Medicaid expansion which would have allowed over 700,000 more Floridians to gain health coverage.</p>\n<p>We once again urge him to follow the lead of both Republican and Democratic governors in urging Medicaid expansion.\xc2\xa0 As you know, 28 states and Washington D.C. have decided to expand Medicaid to date.\xc2\xa0 As a result of this, millions have gained coverage, and millions more would gain coverage if the remaining states like Florida follow suit.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:26 P.M.
