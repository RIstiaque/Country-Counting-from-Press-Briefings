EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Shortly, the Senate is going to consider Senator Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s amendment to weaken the President\xe2\x80\x99s and Senator Dodd\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for strong consumer protection in the financial regulatory bill.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement, and here to talk about that is Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin.</p>\n<p>Neal.</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 The financial crisis has demonstrated beyond any question that our current approach to consumer financial protection has failed.\xc2\xa0 In the run-up to this crisis, millions of Americans were sold mortgages and other financial products that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand and could not afford.\xc2\xa0 Unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the consumer finance market have left Americans facing foreclosure and debts they cannot bear.\xc2\xa0 It left responsible community banks to compete with non-banks and other non-bank institutions in an unlevel playing field, often irresponsible and often unregulated competitors.</p>\n<p>Through the market for mortgage-backed securities, bad practices in the consumer financial market put our entire system at risk.\xc2\xa0 And why is that?\xc2\xa0 Because the current system puts bank regulators in charge of protecting consumers.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no likelihood that it could work.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no focus, no accountability.</p>\n<p>Today seven different regulators have some responsibility for consumer financial protection, but none is focused on consumer protection as their priority.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that there is any focus on consumer protection, the focus is overwhelmingly on banks, not on many, many other thousands of non-bank financial operations -- payday lenders, check cashers, auto lenders, money transmitters, mortgage brokers, et cetera.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This unaccountable fragmented system allows for bad practices to take place in the shadows of the marketplace and we have to put an end to this.</p>\n<p>The President has been very clear about what real reform means in this area.\xc2\xa0 It means independence.\xc2\xa0 It means accountability.\xc2\xa0 It means the ability to write rules across the consumer financial marketplace, and it makes ensuring that banks and non-banks alike are held to the same consistent standard.</p>\n<p>The Dodd legislation pending in the Senate right now does all of that.\xc2\xa0 The Republican alternative does none of it.\xc2\xa0 The Dodd bill creates a fully independent, fully accountable bureau.\xc2\xa0 The Republican alternative just picks an existing consumer office from one banking regulator and drops it into another bank regulator that would be totally subordinate to bank regulators.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked; it will not work.</p>\n<p>The bureau in the Dodd bill has an independent ability to set clear rules of the road across the marketplace.\xc2\xa0 The Republican alternative leaves the bank regulators in charge of the consumer laws -- the same regulators who have shown none or little interest in implementing these laws properly over the last series of years.</p>\n<p>The Dodd bill creates for the first time effective federal authority to adopt rules banning unfair or deceptive practices wherever they may occur.\xc2\xa0 The Republican alternative keeps in place huge legal obstacles that make it nearly impossible to ban unfair or deceptive practices by non-banks like mortgage brokers, payday lenders, auto lenders, et cetera, perpetuating an unfair advantage that these banks have over community banks, for example.</p>\n<p>The Dodd bill creates a bureau that can ensure consistent enforcement of rules across all of this marketplace.\xc2\xa0 It can directly enforce against bigger banks, against mortgage companies, against payday lenders, against auto lenders, and other firms.\xc2\xa0 The Republican alternative gives the so-called consumer office virtually no enforcement authority.</p>\n<p>I think in the end, and to sum it up, the Shelby amendment is actually worse than the status quo.\xc2\xa0 It keeps all of the flaws of today\xe2\x80\x99s system.\xc2\xa0 It keeps banks regulators completely in charge of protecting American families.\xc2\xa0 It keeps a huge loophole for payday lenders, for auto lenders, for mortgage brokers, for check cashers, and for all the other lenders and financial businesses that compete with banks but don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to be called banks.\xc2\xa0 And it actually undermines existing rules.</p>\n<p>Let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 The Republican argument for leaving the bank regulators in charge of protecting consumers is that there is some conflict between consumer protection and the health of financial institutions.\xc2\xa0 We reject that argument out of hand.\xc2\xa0 There is no real conflict between safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions on the one hand, and transparency and fairness for consumers on the other.\xc2\xa0 Strong protections are actually good for the banking system.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve just learned that when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have strong consumer protections, the banking system is very much at risk.</p>\n<p>We saw yesterday that the Republicans have decided to join with the Democrats in the Senate in a constructive way on some issues.\xc2\xa0 But on consumer protection, which really is the issue that arguably sits at the heart of what everyday Americans care about and how they are dealt with by the financial system, the Republicans have continued to oppose serious efforts at reform.\xc2\xa0 I think two years after this financial crisis began, a crisis that was exacerbated by a lack of transparency, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to ensure that we have comprehensive reform that includes these fundamental improvements in consumer protection that the President has put forward and that the Dodd bill in the Senate contains.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the Sanders amendment and what you guys are doing to try to change it or possibly kill it on Fed audit?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say, John, at the start, we oppose the Sanders amendment in its current form.\xc2\xa0 We think that, as Senator Sanders does, that transparency of the Fed is critically important, but we also believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the Federal Reserve Board have independence.\xc2\xa0 We think that independence has served this country very well over a long period of time.\xc2\xa0 We think that countries that have had either the reality or the perception of political influence in their central banks have had real problems -- problems with respect to inflation, with respect to the cost and availability of credit, including to consumers and to small businesses.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked out well where the question about whether the congress or the executive branch of various countries have interfered with or had the perception of interfering with their central bank.</p>\n<p>So we will continue to work with Senator Sanders, Senator Dodd and others to make sure that we have appropriate transparency of the Fed.\xc2\xa0 We think that is important, but also that we make sure that we do not encroach on the independence of the central bank.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you veto -- would the President veto this bill if the Sanders amendment is in there?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 As I said, John, we are continuing to work with Senator Sanders, Senator Dodd and others to make sure we can accomplish these twin objectives.\xc2\xa0 We think that we\xe2\x80\x99ll move forward in those discussions before we get to any discussion about vetoes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Julianna.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President veto the bill if the Shelby amendment was in it?\xc2\xa0 And also where -- is there any room for the President when it comes to the CFPA?\xc2\xa0 Are there elements that he would accept, for example, it being housed in the FDIC as Shelby has proposed?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has expressed his support for the Dodd approach; it very closely mirrors his own.\xc2\xa0 I think -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that the Shelby amendment will pass.\xc2\xa0 We think that there are enough senators who, like the President, are committed to making sure that this incredibly important piece of reform is appropriately addressed.\xc2\xa0 And so I think the question of veto is something that\xe2\x80\x99s premature.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the elements to it that the Dodd -- if the CFPA, as Dodd has proposed, is amended, are there elements that Shelby has proposed that the President would accept?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what others put forward.\xc2\xa0 As I just tried to outline, I think the elements of the Shelby approach, the Republican alternative in the Senate, are things that really gut the strength of this piece of this important legislation with respect to independence, with respect to accountability, effective rule-writing, and then obviously the need for enforcement across this marketplace.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Wolin, you said something very interesting.\xc2\xa0 You said --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just one thing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not think the Shelby amendment will pass,\xe2\x80\x9d and yet all day today I\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting e-mails like from Americans United for Change, all these grassroot Democratic organizations, and you\xe2\x80\x99re out here today making a big deal about a Shelby amendment that you don\xe2\x80\x99t think will pass.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, why is that?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the centrality of the consumer provisions in this legislation.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear from the beginning that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s enormously important; that\xe2\x80\x99s really at the core of what caused the problems we got ourselves into.\xc2\xa0 And the solutions are really at the core of making -- providing rules of the road going forward that will work and be protective not just of consumers but ultimately, as I mentioned earlier, of the broader financial system.</p>\n<p>So we want to make sure that we say clearly and loudly that the Republican amendment will not work on all of the various dimensions that I described.\xc2\xa0 And while it\xe2\x80\x99s pending in front of the Senate, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to express our view.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 The President said that this -- he will not let amendments like this one, written by Wall Street lobbyists, pass for reform.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, if it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the bill, will he veto it?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 I think, Jake, the same answer I gave before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t give an answer.\xc2\xa0 Is it a veto threat or not?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to talk about veto threats, Jake.\xc2\xa0 As I say, we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect this amendment to succeed, and if it comes to that we\xe2\x80\x99ll deal with it when that happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then in terms of the Sanders amendment, Sanders says that -- and the amendment says that nothing shall be construed as interfering with monetary policy.\xc2\xa0 What they want to know is, who received the $2 trillion in Wall Street bailout funds?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration oppose letting the American people know and see who received every dime of the $2 trillion in bailout funds?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we are for transparency.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly important principle and one that, frankly, is well embedded in the Dodd approach and in the approach that the President has put forward.</p>\n<p>What we want to make sure at the same time, though, is that the provision doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, in sort of an unintended way or whatever, get in the -- into the area of monetary policy that encroaches on the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s independence or has the perception of that.\xc2\xa0 Where that has happened in various places, it\xe2\x80\x99s not been a pretty picture.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sanders said that that charge, that it would interfere with monetary policy, he called it bogus.</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think having a multiplicity of voices, Jake, being able to comment on the conduct of monetary policy already creates a bit of an issue.\xc2\xa0 The legislation does take down some barriers that have existed for some time now with respect to the GAO not getting into the middle of monetary policy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support Senator Blanche Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s provision that would effectively force banks to spin off their swaps desks, or does he think that the Volcker rule is enough in that particular area?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with Chairman Lincoln and Chairman Dodd on a very strong package of reforms in the derivatives area -- strong regulation of derivatives dealers, central clearing, transparency through exchange trading, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 We have not taken a position on this precise element.\xc2\xa0 But as the Secretary -- as Secretary Geithner has said, we do want to make sure that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- there isn\xe2\x80\x99t the unintended consequence of taking activities and pushing them off into the shadows.\xc2\xa0 That was an important part of what got us into this set of troubles and we want to make sure that we learn that lesson and don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat it.</p>\n<p>I think the last thing I would say is, in that regard, Sheila Bair has obviously written a strong letter raising some concerns.\xc2\xa0 We are very committed to strong derivatives provisions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with Senator Lincoln and with Senator Dodd all along the way and we will continue to do so to make sure that that framework stays robust.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are you not taking a position on that particular proposal?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, there are lots of different pieces of this and they -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to sort of extract one in isolation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is a big one.\xc2\xa0 I mean, does the President support the idea of banks having to spin off their swaps desks or not?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is a binary question.\xc2\xa0 I think we want to make sure that we accomplish the goals that we set forward, which is to make sure that the dealers in these instruments are well regulated, well capitalized, well looked after, but also that there is transparency through exchange trading and so forth.\xc2\xa0 We also, though, want to make sure, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said now a number of times, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t through what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here create a problem somewhere else.</p>\n<p>And so as the various pieces come together, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we will continue to be attentive to.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Chip and then --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that this bill with this amendment was written by Wall Street lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 What evidence is there that they actually wrote this?\xc2\xa0 The Republicans say that it\xe2\x80\x99s the small business trade associations that are pushing hardest for this amendment.</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, Chip, I would say that there\xe2\x80\x99s been an enormous amount of lobbying activity on these provisions.\xc2\xa0 I refer you to some of the things I said to the Chamber of Commerce a few weeks back.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been I think a broad set of assertions made by big banks in particular, the Chamber of Commerce in addition, with respect to things in the consumer provisions of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal and the Dodd language.\xc2\xa0 I think lobbyists have been chipping away, frankly, all the way through.\xc2\xa0 And this alternative, I think, reflects a lot of the themes that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from them, from their trade associations, from the chamber and so forth.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 How big a threat to the bill is the Republican demand for the strict preemption of state consumer laws?\xc2\xa0 And how confident are you of getting Senator Carper to share your view?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work through that issue with Senator Carper and others.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the national banks, with respect to matters that really interfere with their ability to do their business, ought to realize some preemption.\xc2\xa0 But we also think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for there to be strong consumer protections; that there be a strong set of federal rules with respect to consumer protection that would affect banks and non-banks.\xc2\xa0 And we think that if states want to protect their citizens against the kinds of consumer practices that have really caused an important piece of this crisis, they ought to be free to do so.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 David, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go back a little bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, another amendment question.\xc2\xa0 What about the Brown-Kaufman amendment to cap the size of banks and put on hard leverage placements?\xc2\xa0 Is the administration supporting that or not?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we share Senator Brown and Senator Kaufman\xe2\x80\x99s -- frankly other senators\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about the riskiness of certain institutions.\xc2\xa0 I guess I would say that from our perspective, what\xe2\x80\x99s really key about this is that the institutions be less risky, that they not pose threats to the broader system.\xc2\xa0 Size is one attribute with respect to risk, but there are other attributes.\xc2\xa0 The Dodd bill, as it stands, has important provisions that limit the size of financial institutions, that give regulators the capacity to break them apart when they see things that create risk to the entire system, but also contain a number of other provisions with respect to capital and leverage and so forth that are all in the aggregate meant to make sure that no institution can pose an outsize risk to the broader financial system.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, is the approach that we have been working on and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue work with them on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not supporting that amendment, per se?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to them about the size constraints that we have in the bill that is pending now in the Senate and some of these other issues that I just discussed.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue along that vein.\xc2\xa0 But I think from our perspective, just size -- I mean there are a number of institutions that weren\xe2\x80\x99t so big that caused an awful lot of damage to the financial system.\xc2\xa0 So Bear Stearns, the financial products division of AIG -- neither of them very big, Long-Term Capital Management -- size is not, I think, the single attribute that we feel should be focused on.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Overall, are you optimistic or pessimistic you\xe2\x80\x99ll get overall legislation?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a developing momentum, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to move forward as we have.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday was a good day in terms of the resolution authority piece.\xc2\xa0 I think we will continue to move forward as that momentum continues to develop.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neal, before you go, could you just say what your -- I know Fannie and Freddie aren\xe2\x80\x99t in this, but what are your plans for Fannie and Freddie?</p>\n<p>DEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 The Secretary has said a number of times now that this is an important issue, one that we will turn to and work our way through over the next year.\xc2\xa0 We have outlined -- he has outlined publicly in testimony on the Hill a series of principles that will guide our work in this area.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully important to make sure that the housing markets are stabilized, first and foremost, that we get financial reform as it\xe2\x80\x99s currently pending in the Senate next.\xc2\xa0 And then obviously this is a very important critical set of issues that we will turn to with focus and seriousness and work through over the period ahead.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on the Times Square case.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan-Pakistan meeting earlier today, how much did Shahzad\xe2\x80\x99s possible contacts in Pakistan come up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Without getting into specifics, I will just simply say that John Brennan and others used the opportunity to discuss where we were with the President and those in the room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the Pakistani Taliban come up at all in the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings today and the past on Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 And has the administration\xe2\x80\x99s information shown that this is a group that might be capable of an attack on the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will just say that in the hour and 15 minutes the President spent in that room it was a comprehensive discussion of all of our issues dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 The President heard from Ambassador Eikenberry in getting an update on governance.\xc2\xa0 We spent more than -- probably about 20 or 25 minutes hearing from General McChrystal about the shaping that is going on right now as it relates to Kandahar.\xc2\xa0 So just suffice to say it was a comprehensive meeting on a whole host of those issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one of the big holes in this case right now is still the idea, was Shahzad a lone wolf in this or was he connected to a foreign plot?\xc2\xa0 And the last real statement we had from the administration was Secretary Napolitano over the weekend saying that we thought he was a one-off.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on the investigation is it a -- this is a rapidly developing ongoing investigation, and if there are developments that need to be made public they\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be done so through the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But have you moved away from the idea of him being a one-off?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into parsing where we are on -- and the Department of Justice is on an active investigation.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the administration pleased or satisfied with Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation on this investigation so far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question.\xc2\xa0 The President said --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just -- can we just -- let me make sure -- I want to -- one of the things I think if you look back over the course of 15 or 16 months of our administration, we have dramatically increased our partnership with Pakistan -- intense security cooperation, supporting Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s largest offensive against terrorism within borders -- within its borders in years, an offensive that was -- is focused not just on al Qaeda, but on the Pakistani Taliban as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching topics, the President said a couple weeks ago to business leaders that once financial regulation was passed, that the administration would be shifting to climate change.\xc2\xa0 Then the Arizona law and immigration came up.\xc2\xa0 Last night he spoke about immigration at the Cinco de Mayo party and said he wanted to begin work on immigration this year.\xc2\xa0 Is the next big push after fin reg still going to be climate change?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there are a whole host of things that the administration will work on.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make progress on creating an environment for job creation, right?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I think the House is likely to take up the home retrofitting, the Home Star legislation today, and we believe we\xe2\x80\x99ll pass that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a whole host of those issues -- the small business lending initiative also that has to be worked on.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that the Senate will soon move to, as has been discussed, comprehensive energy legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think what the President has said over the past several weeks on immigration is, as he said last night, we have to begin work on this.\xc2\xa0 But as I said here yesterday and as the President has said before, this is not going to pass without Republican support.\xc2\xa0 This is not going to pass without the people that have been involved in this effort in the years past pledging and showing their support right now.</p>\n<p>So while we begin this effort to shape bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation, its passage is going to be dependent upon whether or not we can find Republicans that are -- that have shared this viewpoint in the past are ready, willing and able to work on this legislation in the present.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it right to draw any connection between what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying and what the President said about immigration and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly analogous.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And so in that sense I would draw a largely direct connection.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The end of my question is, \xe2\x80\x9cand climate change?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a signal that climate change in fact will be a bigger priority -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly something --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that\xe2\x80\x99s derailed Lindsey Graham\xe2\x80\x99s support for it.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that while each is a priority, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m -- this is an earth-shattering comment to believe that the energy legislation is farther ahead of immigration legislation.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s simply a look at where we are in the construction -- legislative construction process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that sense, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s true or not, of a priority is something that has affected Lindsey Graham\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xc2\xa0 So is that something that you\xe2\x80\x99re addressing right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this about Senator Graham\xe2\x80\x99s support.\xc2\xa0 We have worked with Senator Graham I think pretty well in this administration.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been here a number of times to discuss a whole host of issues.\xc2\xa0 All we\xe2\x80\x99ve done on Senator Graham -- with Senator Graham on energy and immigration reform is each and every thing he asked to do, right?\xc2\xa0 He came to the Oval Office, met with the President, and asked that the President, with Senator Schumer, support an outline that they were working for comprehensive immigration reform and asked that we seek additional Republican support through calling five senators.\xc2\xa0 We did each of those things.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve done -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, I think there was an energy meeting and an immigration meeting -- one on a Monday, one on a Tuesday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for where Senator Graham is today.\xc2\xa0 I can simply speak for what he asked the President to do and what the President did to keep his word and his commitment.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of progress that has been made on energy legislation and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody -- Democrat, Republican, or independent, in Joe Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s case -- want to see that work and that commitment walked away from.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up on that, the President has said that he wants it to be a bipartisan bill -- immigration reform.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just be clear.\xc2\xa0 Again, in order to get through, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a math problem, not a perception problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats have been shopping around an immigration reform proposal in the absence of Lindsey Graham being partners with Schumer on this.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to find a Republican yet the last time I checked to join them.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Therein lies the problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is it to the President that the bill itself be one that can attract Republicans even if there are no Republican sponsors?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see what I\xe2\x80\x99m driving at?\xc2\xa0 I mean, because there are some Republicans who say that the Democratic leadership in the Senate is just looking to use this as an issue to gin up and galvanize Democratic voters for the fall.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is trying to do.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement on this issue has been consistent throughout the years.\xc2\xa0 I would say -- whether or not you could get people to vote for something but not be a direct sponsor, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that might be a tougher --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how do you make that equation though?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you look at the 2007 legislation as a template?\xc2\xa0 Do you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there are certainly aspects of the legislation that was done throughout the period of \xe2\x80\x9805 through \xe2\x80\x9807.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look specifically at -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve not evaluated specifically what is in one and isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the other sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I would simply reiterate, Jake, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a luxury in needing Republican support and sponsors -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a necessity.\xc2\xa0 And unless or until we get to that point, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to enact overall comprehensive reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on a couple other things, Neal Wolin talked about Fannie and Freddie reform being something that the President wants to do.\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline for that?\xc2\xa0 Is there any pressing need?\xc2\xa0 Obviously there was some news from Freddie yesterday that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been heartening to the President.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think something we -- that was largely believed to be expected.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t add much, since he\xe2\x80\x99s the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, to what Neal said and what Secretary Geithner have over the past few months outlined.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated to the economic team on either Monday or Tuesday -- I forget exactly which day we were in the Oval -- that this was something that had to be pursued as part of the full panoply of financial reform, even as we ensure, as Neal said, stability in the housing market.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, Senators Lieberman and Scott Brown, as well as Congressmen Altmire and Dent, introduced a law today that would allow the State Department to designate anyone who the State Department believes is providing material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, to strip that person of their citizenship if they are a U.S. citizen.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a position on this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard anybody inside the administration that\xe2\x80\x99s been supportive of that idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the administration opposes it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard anybody that supports it at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want the press release?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I got Google, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the last Afghan -- AfPak meeting, there was a sense from the White House of optimism, that a lot of progress was being made on the ground.\xc2\xa0 What was the tone today in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the phrase that General McChrystal specifically used was that progress has been slow but steady.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that that is likely what we\xe2\x80\x99ll see for the remainder of the year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A couple of -- as we do in all of these meetings, they went through where we are in building an Afghan national security force, both -- which is comprised of an Afghan national army and an Afghan national police -- both of which were ever so slightly ahead of the goals, and that the force flow of our additional troops moving into Afghanistan was on pace, which is obviously something that has been of great concern to the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of -- in the wake of the attempted bombing at Times Square, has intelligence picked up any additional increased activity from various terrorist groups?\xc2\xa0 Are they seeing anything more?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going get into what intelligence officials are picking up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 British elections -- will the White House be paying close attention to that tonight?\xc2\xa0 And any thought given to how that could impact the special relationship that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the outcome will impact any measure of the special relationship.\xc2\xa0 (Interruption.)\xc2\xa0 Is that just in my head or do you all hear that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just in your head.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Happens to me all the time, Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Instructions from outer space.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right when I just can\xe2\x80\x99t quite get the station locked in.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that will impact at all that special relationship.\xc2\xa0 I think we will certainly be watching what happens and I anticipate that the President will at an appropriate time reach out to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The winner.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- reach out to the British government, how about that?\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all sort of watching the -- what might be an interesting result.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that General McChrystal said progress is slow but steady.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the pace of progress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thus far, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did not express any frustration or impatience at how things are going?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President was under no illusions that what we have been involved in for many, many years in Afghanistan is going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of issues -- not just military -- but issues surrounding governance that we\xe2\x80\x99re working through, so I think slow and steady is largely to be what\xe2\x80\x99s expected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that they are still on pace to keep -- to start bringing troops out as he has scheduled?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes -- nothing that was discussed that would change what the President outlined in December.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a fairly alarming piece by Ahmed Rashid -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw it, an op-ed piece in the Post a couple of days ago where he said that North Waziristan now, of all the provinces in western Pakistan, that\xe2\x80\x99s the one that\xe2\x80\x99s the least touched by Pakistani forces and U.S. forces and that it is now such a hotbed of terrorist activity and terrorist training that it is worse than Afghanistan was before 9/11.\xc2\xa0 And Ahmed Rashid is a very respected writer, author --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that discussed in the meeting today?\xc2\xa0 And is that something that people in this administration agree with?\xc2\xa0 Is it that bad?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it was not -- the specific region was not, as I recall, brought up in great detail today.\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say that many regions in Pakistan have been the focus of our cooperative work with Pakistan, the government of Pakistan for the length of our administration, understanding that we have a threat that continues from that region of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know this is probably pointless but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it anyway -- Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Supreme Court -- all right, I was waiting.\xc2\xa0 How many questions did that take?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, anything?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You go about 16 blocks and you hang a right, and you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t go in the front?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is tomorrow a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Every day is a possibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today is a possibility?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have to change your frequency.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say -- that was good.\xc2\xa0 I would say less today given the time that\xe2\x80\x99s elapsed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The weekend?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The weekend?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling it out?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Every day is a possibility.\xc2\xa0 I hear the static coming back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You won\xe2\x80\x99t rule out this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rule out -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rule out anything.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It could be happening right now, for all we know.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xc2\xa0 That would be quite the diversion, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s attendance mandatory at the announcement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the administration consider --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It would still be a big deal.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of deal?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A very big deal.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How loud is the static?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would be a big deal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nice try.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the administration consider reinstating what was at the time an emergency provision to stop for secondary screening people from 14 countries?\xc2\xa0 I know that you sent a note in the briefing that addressed why you think these new measures are superior.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 More comprehensive and, quite frankly, superior given the best information that we have from counterterrorism officials.\xc2\xa0 As I talked about yesterday, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a degraded command and control structure -- upper command and control structure in al Qaeda that has moved them to less sophisticated planning around different events.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t -- they fit a whole host of different profiles that geography alone may not alert you to.\xc2\xa0 So the development of what was announced post the 14 specific countries takes into account the evolving geographic nature of the threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the case of Shahzad are you confident that these new measures would have stopped him for secondary screening?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the administration going to name a new TSA administrator?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you consider it a priority?\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a permanent TSA administrator since January of 2009.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely -- it is.\xc2\xa0 And our improvements in airline safety have -- and in screening are important to our overall increase in domestic defense against a possible terror attack.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it take on great urgency given the events of the last week --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- I think every day it\xe2\x80\x99s an important position.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New job numbers coming out tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- I expect the President will have something to say about that.\xc2\xa0 Going to Buffalo on Thursday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like -- does the President feel like his message on jobs and on economic focus is getting through, or that it\xe2\x80\x99s just being swamped by oil spills and terrorism and everything else that keeps cropping up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we did a little of this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, I think the American people -- as you heard Neal say -- most of the American people\xe2\x80\x99s intersection with this financial crisis has been through aspects that would be better regulated with a consumer -- something that looks after the consumer -- the protection of consumers financially.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I think what\xe2\x80\x99s going on on the floor now is very emblematic of an economic agenda.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think those are -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s different than something else.</p>\n<p>As I said earlier, the House is likely to take up and pass an aspect of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal even as both houses work on a small business lending issue.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting new jobs numbers tomorrow, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to evaluate where we are on the road to further economic recovery.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Jonathan, you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President has to be able to walk, chew gum, juggle and ride a unicycle all at the same time.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of just doing -- or focusing on one thing, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has had to do, quite frankly, throughout the whole of his administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I just follow up?\xc2\xa0 Apparently the Dow is dropping 1,000; the European markets have stopped lending.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I -- first I\xe2\x80\x99ve --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s news to you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 First I\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- my producer did not hand me a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, mine did, and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- no, I understand, I will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk more generally about the crisis in Greece?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 All I want to say is obviously the President has heard regularly from his economic team -- from Secretary Geithner, from Director Summers; been in frequent communications, as they have been, with European counterparts.\xc2\xa0 The Treasury is monitoring the situation closely.\xc2\xa0 The reforms that are needed to be enacted in Greece are important and will take some time.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to monitor that.\xc2\xa0 I will see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything specific as it relates to that when I get back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could, the leaders of the House Republican Conference have objected to U.S. participation in the IMF loan for Greece.\xc2\xa0 I presume the President supports it.\xc2\xa0 Tell me why he feels it\xe2\x80\x99s needed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me get something more specific on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I have not seen the House conferences --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They sent a letter to Geithner basically characterizing it as a taxpayer bailout of Greece, though the U.S., of course, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide all the funds for the IMF loan.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me find something else out for you guys on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we now say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s interviews with candidates for the High Court are over?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been told that, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 On his remarks yesterday in the Rose Garden, does he object as strongly to the modified Arizona immigration law as he did to the original one?\xc2\xa0 It sounded yesterday like he was talking about the original law and changes, modifications have been made in it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with those folks here and at Justice, but I know of no change in our belief as originally stated by the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding is under the modified law, police just can\xe2\x80\x99t go up to somebody they suspect of being an illegal immigrant, but they can only ask about it if they\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped that individual for a different -- for a legal purpose.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sneaking a stoplight or something like that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which that changes things, to be 100 percent honest with you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Julianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President having separate briefings on the Greek debt crisis?\xc2\xa0 Or is it part of the daily economic briefing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Generally has been -- I will double-check on this, but generally the updates that he has gotten have been a part of the economic daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there have been a couple of calls -- one on Sunday to the Greeks, and one, I believe it was the last week with Chancellor Merkel, that obviously involved some separate meetings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he talk directly to Greek leaders?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, what was the Sunday call?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That -- yes, I believe there was a -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the readout.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he was updated this morning in his daily --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the 10:00 a.m. meeting, but I will -- I presume that it came up.\xc2\xa0 It had come up in earlier staff meetings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then also just more broadly when it comes to regulatory reform, the President publicly and advisors even in private meetings have told the big banks to call off their lobbyists, wanting them to stop watering down provisions of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense that that message has gotten through at all?\xc2\xa0 Or do you see the big banks cooperating any more?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there have been some banks that have stated their support for financial reform.\xc2\xa0 There are others that continue to -- through both their personal actions and the actions of their exceedingly large group of well-paid lobbyists that continue, as you heard Neal talk about, continue to try to water down reform on behalf of the American people.</p>\n<p>The President has been very clear about the principles that he sees that are tremendously important in ensuring strong rules of the road going forward to make sure nothing happens like this again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you like to say who those other banks are that have been --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think many of them know who they are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with Chancellor Merkel that dealing with the -- the future of Europe really is at stake in dealing with the Greek crisis that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard the President talk about that specifically.\xc2\xa0 As I said here earlier, several weeks ago in the beginning of this, this was an important thing for the Europeans to work through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a little further on this.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden spoke to the European parliament this morning but spent very little time on the economic crisis.\xc2\xa0 Why has the White House seemed to be so reluctant to speak out more forcefully about what Europe should be doing about Greece and with Portugal and Spain and Ireland waiting in the wings?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would point you to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything that those in Europe have sought Secretary Geithner and others, including the President, to do on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just another subject, today\xe2\x80\x99s AfPak meeting, how much time was spent on President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s visit next week and who weighed in on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We talked a little bit about that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see -- look, a whole host of -- as many of you would expect, Secretary of State Clinton, General Jones, General Lute, Ambassador Eikenberry -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to go through the room now -- Ambassador Holbrooke -- I would say those are some that talked about the -- President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming visit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, could you address the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view of the extent to which the United States is vulnerable to a debt contagion spinning out from the European Union?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get somebody from Treasury who will have a more technical answer.\xc2\xa0 The viewpoint that I have heard in many of these meetings is that anything that we believe has the ability to affect the global economic recovery is and should be a concern to this country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why, as I said a minute ago, the President and officials here have done all that\xe2\x80\x99s been asked of them in responding.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the AfPak meeting as well, was there any discussion at all of Iraq and its efforts, ongoing efforts to put a government together that would allow the United States forces to draw down?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not specifically this morning in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 Let me get back and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- if there was an Iraq meeting over the past few days.*</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I ask you, on the oil spill and the economic impact of it, I realize it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be reflected in the jobs numbers tomorrow but is there a concern that in the subsequent months that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a quantifiable impact from the loss of business there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The discussions that I saw on Sunday, the briefing with Thad Allen, with the President, at that point -- and again, I caution that -- I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s Thursday and that was Sunday -- was that they believed that they had a manageable plan for how to deal with the potential impact on shipping lanes in particular.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously I think you all understand that the SBA administrator I think today outlined -- well, I know today -- outlined a program for providing assistance to those that -- largely fishermen that as a result of the spill and the closures that have been involved that have -- that it will greatly impact their business at an important time for their livelihood.</p>\n<p>I have not heard or seen a larger report on, as you said, what that may mean weeks and months down the road.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the last few seconds while you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking, the Dow really dipped down below 10,000 for a second.\xc2\xa0 Is the President -- is there anything he can tell Americans to not worry that the overall economy isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be shaken by the situation in Greece or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, let me -- give me the -- let me go find out -- you guys have -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start bringing my computer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- right there.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, these little things just say \xe2\x80\x9cThe White House\xe2\x80\x9d and you click on them and they go to a blank screen and then it goes back to \xe2\x80\x9cThe White House.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is -- no, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much did it cost?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do a thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You need Bloomberg, you need a Bloomberg --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s rather dramatic.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not doubting it is, you just have to understand that I -- while they appear to be television screens, they\xe2\x80\x99re largely unhelpful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think the President will address this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, let me go find out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have two questions, one to follow up on Scott\xe2\x80\x99s question about AfPak and Karzai coming.\xc2\xa0 The last time the President met with him, he kind of read him the riot act.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the -- going to be the tone of this meeting or is it any different than last time?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, look, I think that I would broadly define the role that each of these two individuals is going to be play is we are -- we have a partnership with Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We have -- the President has tripled our forces in that country to deal with al Qaeda and its extremist allies.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai in his inaugural and then later at the London conference outlined a series of reforms that he believe and that we believe are necessary.\xc2\xa0 We will laud him for the actions that he takes that are positive steps in implementing the reforms that he\xe2\x80\x99s outlined, and we will work with them to ensure they make progress on those that are harder to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like anything has changed since the last -- in your estimation since the last time they met.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think there have been very positive developments in the elections commission, particularly in the one or two days right after the visit, that demonstrate that reform progress has and is being made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on immigration, you were saying before, and obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s true as a practical matter, this thing can\xe2\x80\x99t go forward without Republican support that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have right now.\xc2\xa0 A lot of immigration activists are asking, why not treat this like financial reform?\xc2\xa0 You guys went ahead -- you went through two or three I think cloture votes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in other words, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop you when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Republicans aboard for financial reform.\xc2\xa0 You went ahead anyway.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t immigration reform similar?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough support to move forward, Mara.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just -- I mean, go back and look at the votes in 2006 and 2007, and go look at who voted in what way, and go ask those guys and gals where they are on this bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make many calls to figure out that the people on the Republican side that supported this proposal three or four years ago -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re supporting it, it\xe2\x80\x99s muted support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When immigration supporters say why isn\xe2\x80\x99t this like financial reform, the answer is because you actually like secret Republican support for financial reform and you just had to go through the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to tell you I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand the analogy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, because you called the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 bluff on that, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get them onboard before you brought it to the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I just -- I think that in order to get something -- I think it has been clear through four and five years of votes, Mara, that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a hefty number of Republicans, because we all know there are some that aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to support this on our side.\xc2\xa0 But the truth of this is there\xe2\x80\x99s not the support that there was in 2007 on the Republican side.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a math -- well, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a political thing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a math thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in his speech at the University of Michigan, the President talked about the need to tone down the rhetoric, something we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously heard him mention several times before.\xc2\xa0 How do you square that with his statement today on the Republican alternative, which, as Chip mentioned, accused Republicans of having lobbyists write their bill?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty harsh rhetoric itself, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you the clip from the Republicans calling the lobbyists up to Capitol Hill in order to kill the financial reform bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- if that was something that was embarrassing, I think that might have been embarrassing on their part a long time ago.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do much to find hefty examples of many individuals either asking for political contributions based on the legislation that the President and Senator Dodd have proposed, or in calling legions of lobbyists to offices on Capitol Hill in order to kill financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I think the votes are going to line up with those that want to see progress on behalf of the people of this country, and those who want to see reform installed on behalf of Wall Street and the big banks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Times Square attack for a moment, if there are suspects identified in Pakistan, would those people be brought to New York and tried?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would need to get some clarity on that.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the individual circumstances that might determine such a thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you say at the moment if there have been any direct links tied between people in Pakistan and this incident?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not anything I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get into at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could I just ask one other quick question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President looking at going to Israel any time this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the foreign travel with me, but I could certainly check.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Back on the AfPak meeting, is President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s meeting definitely going to happen next week, or is this still remotely in doubt?\xc2\xa0 And did any of the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 His visit is scheduled for next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And are any of the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What day?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- he\xe2\x80\x99s here a host of days.\xc2\xa0 I think the President meets on Wednesday, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 12th.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So were any of the advisors in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting advocating against that meeting going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the last time President Karzai was here he came out with the President but there was not an opportunity to ask him questions.\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether they intend to do joint questions and answers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is on a list to talk to folks about today, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many of us might be interested in asking him a question, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, I will check.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In Jonathan Alter\xe2\x80\x99s new book, the President is quoted as using a vulgar term to describe the Tea Party movement.\xc2\xa0 Is the quote accurate, and does the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- I barely have enough time to read my briefing books, and what I have -- I have -- no offense to Jonathan, but I have not read his book.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99d only have to read one word to answer his question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, you go buy me Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s book so that he gets the royalty --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Deal, deal.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- and I will be glad to read the word.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about this, though?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the answer then that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The answer is I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the book.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on one issue -- on two issues, one on the Gulf of Mexico situation.\xc2\xa0 Has anyone in this White House -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to a question that I originally asked you when you had that briefing with all the principals on it -- has anyone in the administration worked with any of the oil companies in trying to work on the prices that are expected to rise?\xc2\xa0 Also, has anyone within the administration talked to the fisheries, talked to many of the people who have produce or are dealing with produce down there and marine life that we eat on the table?\xc2\xa0 I mean, has anyone dealt with that, tried to keep the price down as this economy is still --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on -- this was a little bit of where Mark was heading, in a sense, on sort of the comprehensive environmental -- or economic impact.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the President met with local fishermen.\xc2\xa0 SBA is down there offering loans -- low-interest loans to small businesses that are affected by the spill.</p>\n<p>I will say that the way I understood it and the way it was described to me, this is a -- this is an exploratory well.\xc2\xa0 The BP Deepwater Horizon well was an exploratory rather than a production well, so the oil to be extracted from this was not planned on -- that was not planned to go online immediately.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if a series or amount of oil is being taken out of the planned production of BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But during that press conference -- and you were the one who said this -- that the President was advised that there would be oil that could possibly be in the way of shipping.\xc2\xa0 It would stand in the way of shipping.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I talked about that with Mark.\xc2\xa0 The Sunday briefing that we got from Admiral Allen, which I think that you guys probably saw the video, there was a projection screen with mapping that had, at that point, where the oil spill had spread to, and went through a whole host of -- there\xe2\x80\x99s many shipping lanes in that area -- to get into the port of New Orleans and ultimately up the Mississippi.\xc2\xa0 I will check again on the economics of shipping and seafood.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, on the issue of Haiti, everyone is dealing with emergent issues right now.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard this White House talk that much about Haiti.\xc2\xa0 We understand recently that the President signed into law a debt forgiveness for Haiti.\xc2\xa0 But is the President at all thinking still about going to Haiti, and is the President getting any kind of still a daily update on progress reports in Haiti and also the fact that military units are leaving Haiti?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President gets a daily update on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the First Lady was there not too recently.\xc2\xa0 We have -- obviously the footprint involved for the President of the United States to go, we believe, would hinder the -- have always believed that would hinder efforts at relief and recovery.\xc2\xa0 So there are not to my knowledge any plans to do so.</p>\n<p>Tom.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 But first, are you able to get an answer on Fred\xe2\x80\x99s question about the tea-bagger quote, if the President is aware that people are offended and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the book.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask the President that.\xc2\xa0 But I will entertain it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my first question is, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk lately about the lack of presidential news conferences, notwithstanding the nuclear summit.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Notwithstanding the last one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been suggested that rather than having formal news conferences, that the President maybe pick a day at random during the month to come down here and brief us the way you do.\xc2\xa0 What would you think about a plan like that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are about 10,000 answers beaming through my head, none of which I think would be -- I will -- again, I appreciate the notion that, except for the last time that the President did that -- I think the President -- I think the President has got a pretty remarkably busy schedule that he\xe2\x80\x99s working through right now.</p>\n<p>You had one more?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, one more.\xc2\xa0 The Neil Cavuto thing -- notwithstanding, again, the fact that what Michael Brown said was only slightly less crazy than what you said he said --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I will say this -- can I say this to Neil?\xc2\xa0 I was -- I apparently had the wrong FOX show.\xc2\xa0 There were two references on \xe2\x80\x9cFOX &amp; Friends\xe2\x80\x9d to the deliberate nature of the spill being set.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Brown, it was somebody else?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes I get it all mixed up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Sam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve had your hand up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a 10-part question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, you talked to Jake about -- that you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard anyone inside the administration that\xe2\x80\x99s supportive of Senator Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to strip citizenship.\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they supportive?\xc2\xa0 Can you get into this a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I have not heard large enumerations on why, except that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would find that to be such an effective way.\xc2\xa0 I will try to get a better explanation as to why no one supports it.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed Democrats and Republicans alike express concern about the legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the second one is, Chuck Schumer has an interesting proposal to the state of Arizona to put their immigration law on hold for a year so that a federal law can be enacted.\xc2\xa0 What do you think of the idea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this, that I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, and I have said certainly in this room, that without a comprehensive federal law, Arizona and 49 other states could well enact a myriad of different proposals for an issue that can and should be dealt with at the federal level.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has begun the work that he has and hopes that we have Republican support to address this in a comprehensive way.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that -- it is something that, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t address this at the federal level, is simply going to create a 50-state patchwork of immigration laws.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to call for a momentary delay in implementation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- I saw a story on what Senator Schumer had -- I think I saw a copy of the letter.\xc2\xa0 I have not talked with immigration officials on that yet.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:14 P.M.
