b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>See below for an answer to a question(marked with an asterisk)posed in the briefing that required follow up.</p>\n<p>* The fund is administered by BP. How that fund is distributed, whether through a foundation, a charity or through Ken Feinberg is for them to decide.</p>\n<p><br/>\n3:00 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Take us away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the arrest yesterday of the suspected Russian spies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to leave this at -- I mean, obviously the President was fully and appropriately informed.\xc2\xa0 This was a law enforcement action, and law enforcement acted appropriately.\xc2\xa0 And he did not have a personal reaction that I know of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he aware of the possibility of these arrests before yesterday, or was yesterday the first time that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, he was -- he\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed on this a number of times.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back how far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get specific on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this comes, obviously, less than a week after the meetings here with Medvedev.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that this hurts the chances of resetting this relationship, given that there are allegations that the Russians were spying against us?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think that if you -- I do not believe that this will affect the reset of our relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We have made great progress in the past year and a half, working on issues of mutual concern from a New START treaty to working together on things like in the United Nations dealing with North Korea and Iran.\xc2\xa0 So I do not think that this will affect those relations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask about McChrystal quickly, has there been any decision made on whether he is going to be allowed to retire as a four-star?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, General McChrystal, I think, alerted the Pentagon yesterday that he would be leaving active duty.\xc2\xa0 As you also know, he has not been in the position, a four-star position long enough to retire as a four-star.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes -- and has talked with Secretary Gates about this -- and we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that he, somebody who has served the country as ably as he has, can retire at a four-star level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you will try to allow him to retire as a four-star?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the White House support removing the bank tax from the financial regulation bill in order to gain 60 votes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, obviously we are working with the conferees on removing any hurdles to passage of strong financial reform legislation, which we\xe2\x80\x99re on the cusp of doing.\xc2\xa0 So I would leave it at we\xe2\x80\x99re working with them to ensure that we have 60 votes to move this legislation forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see that tax as one of the hurdles that could be removed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a discussion that is going on amongst those on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if those on Capitol Hill went that way, is that something that you would support?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with them to look for any solution that might be needed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on climate change today, after the meeting the statement said that the President was open to other approaches aside from putting a price on carbon to get several different goals like reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 What other approaches would he be open to specifically?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to narrow or open up our legislative bidding from up here.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated his position that putting a price on carbon, he believes, is the right policy.\xc2\xa0 I think science has shown why that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 I do think that you had a bipartisan group of legislators here who understand the need to move this legislation forward and get something done this year.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President was hopeful after that meeting that we can find common ground on a lot of different subjects.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he think that the legislation can be passed this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Yes, Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tom Balanoff is a local labor leader in Chicago and in testimony today at the Blagojevich trial he talks about a phone call that he got from Barack Obama on Monday evening before the Tuesday election, at which he quotes Mr. Obama as saying that he thinks Valerie Jarrett should be a United States senator, that she fits the criteria; \xe2\x80\x9cI would prefer that she remain working for President Obama, but she does want to be Senator.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And Balanoff said he told the soon-to-be President, \xe2\x80\x9cI said, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reach out to Governor Blagojevich with that.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did the President make that phone call?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re telling me about this testimony.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into commenting on obviously an ongoing trial.\xc2\xa0 And I have had not had an opportunity to see that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve said before that the President did not get involved with the suggestions or the conversations with Blagojevich.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ann, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get into commenting on an ongoing trial.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Robert, when the President met with President Medvedev, did they discuss at all the Russian spy ring?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us anything more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech on Thursday on immigration?\xc2\xa0 What will be the main message and who will it be aimed at?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as you know, the President met with groups that believe, as he does, yesterday that a comprehensive solution to immigration has to be sought and passed.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President has worked on that for many years.\xc2\xa0 He has additional meetings on that topic today, and will reiterate again his desire to move forward on that comprehensive reform, that we can\xe2\x80\x99t have -- as we have seen, we cannot have immigration reform passed individually by each state through a patchwork of laws.</p>\n<p>So he will reiterate that, and, Dan, will certainly take the opportunity to reiterate that what in the past has been something that members of both parties have worked on, that one party alone cannot solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 Only with Republican support can -- and that Republican support has certainly been there in the past -- only with Republican support can we move forward on immigration.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On financial reform, how confident is the President that he is going to get the 60 votes?\xc2\xa0 And does he think he could have it on his desk by July 4th, as they had originally hoped?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we -- Chip, our hope is to get this done as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 I do think, whether or not it is done by the end of this week, obviously there are some logistical hurdles that are going to have to be met in order to do that.</p>\n<p>I will say that if you go back to January or even many of the months between January and now, there was always a question as to whether this was going to get done.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is a question now whether it will get done.\xc2\xa0 It will either get done more likely the week -- the next week that they\xe2\x80\x99re back than this week, but the President will very shortly sign comprehensive financial reform legislation that puts in place rules that prevent the type of activity and the type of effect that happened in September of 2008 from ever happening again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the President had -- reached out to or had any conversations with any of the Republicans who they hope to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see the last time he made -- has made calls.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could ask a quick question on -- there\xe2\x80\x99s confusion over the $100 million fund in the Gulf right now.\xc2\xa0 Ken Feinberg said yesterday that the White House and BP had agreed to give him jurisdiction over claims from individuals and businesses harmed by the six-month moratorium.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he said he was just finding out that that was the case.\xc2\xa0 Then we contacted him today about that and he put out a statement saying until it is determined who will hold the $100 million, it is unclear who will oversee and process the individual moratorium claims.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I was -- my understanding was that the first statement that he -- that was money that was to be dispersed by him was not the way I understood it.\xc2\xa0 But given the fact that there is confusion on that level, let me take that question and I will get an answer around in our transcript.*</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any confusion on the $20 billion?\xc2\xa0 Is it still the case that the $20 billion is not for people affected by the moratorium?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few follow-ups -- one, did the President know about this Russian spy deal before he met with Medvedev?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the hard one.\xc2\xa0 So he did know about it.\xc2\xa0 Second, on fin reg, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the bank fee, is this something you will continue to pursue further if it does not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a part of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President outlined in his State of the Union address earlier in the year the need to repay the taxpayers fully for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\xc2\xa0 So this does not close the door on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s not in here, you could --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t close the door on doing that at a later date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On energy, can you make an argument that you can price carbon without it looking like -- without it being a tax?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously there are a number of different ways that you can -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on all of the different proposals that are in front of the Senate right now in terms of how -- of how one -- each of the proposals and how they do it.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Chuck, we understand that -- and the President has met with a countless number of CEOs over the past many months that discussed the need for greater certainty in how they do business that have advocated this type of approach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So obviously there are a number of different ways to do it.\xc2\xa0 I think the President felt encouraged by the meeting in trying to move all of these proposals forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say definitively -- now on the oil spill -- can you say definitively that you guys are fulfilling every skimmer request that\xe2\x80\x99s been made by all four states that are affected right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we are -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are -- one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s happened most recently, there are for clean water -- for sites that are governed by the Clean Water Act, there are certain federal and state requirements to have response capabilities on hand in the event that something happens at a facility.\xc2\xa0 We have asked on an emergency basis that some of these rules be waived.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And have they been?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not waiting on a rule to be waived right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- look, obviously some of these are governed by individual rules at facilities.\xc2\xa0 We have begun to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve waived at a number of those places, and I can try to find the specific numbers in order to move greater skimming capability down to the Gulf, understanding that, Chuck, this is not -- these are vessels that are at a facility based on the requirements in the law that we have the capability at a facility to deal with any type of emergency.</p>\n<p>So we understand right now it is more imperative that they be in the Gulf, understanding that we are assuming some amount of risk in doing that now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is there are some boats that could be skimming that you\xe2\x80\x99re not sending over because you need to keep a minimum amount on hand?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is we are waiving those rules to move additional skimming capability to the Gulf, understanding that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve fulfilled every request for skimmers that every state has asked for?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on what the exact numbers are.\xc2\xa0 Also understand, too, Chuck, that as the -- very early on, we were asked sort of how does the -- this looks different or there\xe2\x80\x99s different characteristics than sort of something that happened in Alaska for the Valdez.\xc2\xa0 Because right now, and I think you can see this in news coverage, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure your reporters on the ground will tell you -- you guys probably saw this when we were down there -- there is not -- there isn\xe2\x80\x99t just one slick, right?\xc2\xa0 There are smaller slicks of oil identified by planes, radioed to boats, skimmers sent to intercept those pockets of oil.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point in which obviously different capabilities are called on based on the characteristics of the spill having changed some as well.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not one mass of oil; it\xe2\x80\x99s many, many --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are we hearing from local leaders that there are not enough skimmers, there are not enough skimmers?\xc2\xa0 Where do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s coming from?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s coming from the fact that this is an unprecedented emergency.\xc2\xa0 We have -- we worked early on to -- and many states -- I will say, many states updated their response plans after this happened, because -- for instance, the boom requirements.\xc2\xa0 Those are plans that are put in place by the states to what they think they need.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether skimmers are in those ACPs or not.\xc2\xa0 But obviously as the depth of the response -- I should say the length of the response has gone on, those plans have been augmented and we will continue to move as much -- as many additional skimming capabilities as we can down to that region.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ahead of the energy meeting today, the White House said that the goal was to find -- figure out where the common ground was on energy legislation.\xc2\xa0 Afterwards Senators Lieberman and Kerry said that there was consensus to do a price on carbon, though perhaps not economy-wide, but modified in some version.\xc2\xa0 Is that also the White House view of where the consensus was, and is that where you think this is headed now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, obviously Senator Reid is going to figure out the vehicle that moves in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t disagree, obviously, with what Senators Kerry and Lieberman said as some of their takeaway from that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, was that the takeaway from the White House\xe2\x80\x99s point of view that this is where the consensus is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- look, I think many people can take many different things away.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the things the President took away was the encouraging notion that we can move forward and get something done this year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you say how often Ben Bernanke briefs the President on a -- at an economic daily briefing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have all of that in front of me, Mark.\xc2\xa0 He has been over here on occasion.\xc2\xa0 He was over here today to speak about where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed in financial reform and where we are in the arc of our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it infrequent rather than frequent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the stats in front of me to the degree to which -- how many times the President has talked to him or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about the town meeting tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information a bit later today.\xc2\xa0 The focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks before the town hall meeting will be on the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Gulf, is the President and Vice President going to alternate visits to the Gulf?\xc2\xa0 Is that what today was about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, obviously the Vice President is in Louisiana and will go to Pensacola later in the day.\xc2\xa0 Obviously many in the Cabinet have been down there quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when the President\xe2\x80\x99s next trip would be, but, look, the Vice President felt it important to go down and both see and hear firsthand from state and local officials as well as Admiral Allen and those on the ground responding to this disaster to see where we are.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Napolitano and Carol Browner were in the region yesterday as -- wrapping up some meetings that staff were down there for throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Worried about the storm?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the -- I know Secretary Napolitano spoke with the governor of Texas today about upcoming preparations for the storm.\xc2\xa0 I think many of you all have talked to folks here and in the Gulf about preparations that have to be taken in the event that a storm more closely comes into the area.\xc2\xa0 And in preparation for the possibility of this a few days ago, obviously equipment was taken off of the Enterprise, which I think Thad Allen said yesterday would delay the next step in the containment, which is a helix device that will increase our capability off of the second line coming up from -- in addition to the top hat.</p>\n<p>So obviously preparations are being made.\xc2\xa0 A plan is in place in the event that vessels have to be moved, people have to be evacuated.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we continue on the long-term steps through the drilling of the two relief wells to ultimately get this well capped, which would be a permanent solution that we would not be dependent on Mother Nature -- or I should say Mother Nature wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dictate what our capabilities are on the surface.</p>\n<p>Hans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you just said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how frequently Bernanke is there for the morning eco briefing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty infrequent when the President makes a statement with Bernanke by his side.\xc2\xa0 Talk to us about the optics of that.\xc2\xa0 What was the message there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, Chairman Bernanke was here to talk of several things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President concluded some important meetings over the weekend on the international response to the economic crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all dealt with.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on the cusp of real and genuine financial reform.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing to move forward on steps like a small business lending facility that action was taken in the Senate today to move that proposal forward, on how we can continue to make progress in our economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see -- it\xe2\x80\x99s jobs week -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll see numbers at the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why do a statement with Bernanke by his side?\xc2\xa0 He rarely, if never, does that.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, does he want the gravitas of Ben Bernanke?\xc2\xa0 Does he want to calm markets?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard him talk about -- where we are on our economic recovery is something that the President talks about quite frequently, and having Chairman Bernanke here to discuss those other topics seemed appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was just random that Bernanke was there next to him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t random that he was there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he was obviously here to talk about the things that I just talked about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he was there for the public statement that the President gave to us.\xc2\xa0 Because if he\xe2\x80\x99s here frequently or infrequently --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So that Bloomberg could have exclusive access to the Chairman of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious question, you guys --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I mean, you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to give you a serious answer three times.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand why the President felt that he needed to give a statement on the economy, which he does nearly every week, with Bernanke by his side -- what we should read into that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you should read anything into it, despite my best efforts to describe otherwise.\xc2\xa0 Again, Chairman Bernanke obviously, as you know, plays an incredibly important role; has worked for the past 17 months to stabilize our financial system, to speed our recovery; was here to meet with the President and the economic team.\xc2\xa0 And I want the record to reflect this is the first time you guys have -- that Hans has complained about too much access.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not complaining.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- 30 seconds to -- no, I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arizona Governor Jan Brewer describes yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with federal officials about National Guard troops going to the border as \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very disappointing.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 She says they\xe2\x80\x99re only getting a fraction of the number they really need.\xc2\xa0 Are the people of Arizona being let down in this situation? <br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, the President has made a decision to move 1,200 National Guardsmen to the border, 524 of which will be deployed in Arizona.\xc2\xa0 There obviously is and continues to be extraordinary efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to secure our border as part of the beginnings of comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She said she needs at least 3,000 troops.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President has made a big commitment to securing the border and to Arizona.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arizona Senator Jon Kyl continues to insist, despite the White House\xe2\x80\x99s assurances it did not happen, that the President told him, if we secure the border, you people -- being -- meaning Republicans -- will not vote for comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, to be fair, this appears now to be an argument that the senator is having with himself, right?\xc2\xa0 A couple weeks ago he made a statement that we said wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.\xc2\xa0 Then I believe on Friday, the senator said that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.\xc2\xa0 Now I think he has made a statement saying what he said about it not being the case may not now be the case.</p>\n<p>So I refer you, Wendell, to his spokesperson saying at the beginning of this process that there were two people involved in this conversation.\xc2\xa0 It appears as if the problem is one of them has three recollections.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to, when Senator Kyl decides which of the three stories he thinks happened in that meeting, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy when he comes to some white smoke and concludes what his answer is on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you prepared for that question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you announce the new OMB Director with white smoke or black smoke?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Once more, can we ask you for a little bit more about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s town hall, other than --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that a little bit later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t even say who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be a friendly audience?\xc2\xa0 Have you guys chosen who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve never chosen any of the questioners at our town halls that I think, Anne, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been coming to for three years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little about Thursday, and why now?\xc2\xa0 Why is he giving -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about immigration repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be anything new?\xc2\xa0 And any news out of the Justice Department?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, for news out of the Justice Department I would direct you to them.\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- I think, look, this continues to be a very important national issue, and will reiterate, again, his support for doing this in a comprehensive way, but also in reiterating what he said to the Republicans when he visited the Senate caucus.\xc2\xa0 He cannot do this alone.\xc2\xa0 He worked in 2005 and in 2006 with senators from across the aisle in making comprehensive -- in trying to make comprehensive immigration reform the law of the land.\xc2\xa0 The only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that now is to do that working with the other side of the aisle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this will be a reiteration, largely.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Largely, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in the past when Russian spies have been caught in the United States, the United States has registered its displeasure with this in some diplomatic form or another.\xc2\xa0 When Robert Hanssen was arrested, the United States government kicked out 50 Russian diplomats.\xc2\xa0 Are you all contemplating anything like that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Department of State about the conversations that have taken place and continue to take place between State Department officials and Russian officials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you find this to be something that is offensive, or simply business as usual?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously this is something that was -- that is important and was treated as such yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, can you elaborate a little bit, though?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President did just invite the President of Russia here to visit with him -- brought him for burgers and the whole bit.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Peter, I really do not want to get into talking about active law enforcement investigations or intelligence matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also about the relationship between two countries, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t find it offensive that this other country you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build a new relationship with is still spying on you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said that -- I said earlier that I did not think that this would affect our moves to reset the relationship, and we believe that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they have license to do whatever they want without any consequences?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case, because there were multiple arrests that were made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stay on the same subject.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About -- about, yes, about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He had a feeling you might not ask about the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask about the economy, but next time if you give me the question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Take it up with Mark later, because he might seek to reclaim his time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, this one, this one, I want to stick with this subject.\xc2\xa0 The timing -- the timing.\xc2\xa0 Was the President completely satisfied by whoever organized the operation this week that this was the time that it needed to be done, right after the summit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of discussing the law enforcement or the intelligence portions of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand.\xc2\xa0 Let me finish my answer.\xc2\xa0 This was an action that was taken by law enforcement, handled that way, handled appropriately, and done in a timely manner.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Russians --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good luck trying to get -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I feel obliged, since I\xe2\x80\x99m the only Russian here, to raise the point -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Now I\xe2\x80\x99m like the straight man for a bunch of people standing on the side.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I am the only official Russian here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And as such, I want to raise the point that is being raised by my government officials who say this is a deliberate attempt to undermine, frankly, the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies, and some people even say the President himself.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President of Russia, I assume you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President of the United States and his policy of reset.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, well, I see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say it will not affect the policy of reset.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This will not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about an attempt to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to that.\xc2\xa0 There are -- again, I described this, I think accurately, as a law enforcement activity.\xc2\xa0 It was handled as such.\xc2\xa0 It was done correctly.\xc2\xa0 I do not -- again, I do not believe that this will have a great effect on our efforts to reset our relationship with Russia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, the President had absolutely no influence over the timing of the arrests, one way or the other?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is -- again, this is dictated by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that a yes or -- that was a no, he did not?\xc2\xa0 I want to be clear about it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was.\xc2\xa0 The timing of this was dictated by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert, just two questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, Lester -- Lester, Lester.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go to Mara and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Saudi visit, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President plans to ask the Saudis again for more gestures to Israel.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done that in the past -- hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a whole lot of results for it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in -- Mara, I was not in the statements that were just made.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the topic of Middle East peace, the topic of the Saudi support of the Arab Peace Initiative -- all of those topics -- again, I was not in there, but I know those did come up.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the President reiterated his desire to push for this comprehensive peace.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve got Prime Minister Netanyahu coming soon as well to continue to make progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should we assume that he still wants the Saudis to make the same -- the gestures he asked them to earlier in the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, again, I was not in there.\xc2\xa0 But the readout I got was that the Saudis reiterated their support for the Arab Peace Initiative, which is an important aspect of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President hold open the possibility for passage of immigration reform this year, given that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a single Republican co-sponsor and no legislative language in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are proposals that are being worked on.\xc2\xa0 Peter, that\xe2\x80\x99s a better question for Republicans that have believed this was an important issue when they were in power.\xc2\xa0 It is no less an important issue now that there is a Democrat in the White House.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to work with anybody that desires to work with he and others on a comprehensive solution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he actively making calls to Republicans to try to round up support?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He made calls -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the exact timing of this -- obviously reached out to I think half a dozen folks not too long ago on this topic.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 When the senators came out of the energy meeting today, I believe it was Senator Lieberman who talked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that this legislation should be the legislative vehicle for all of the -- for some of the BP stuff or all of the BP stuff.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify what oil -- what BP-related stuff would be on the energy bill and what you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to separate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I did not hear that portion of Senator Lieberman\xe2\x80\x99s thing, but let me find out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ask follow-up questions in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you at least tell us what the President said in that meeting about BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the meeting, but, again, I will clarify what part of -- whether energy legislation that will move through the Senate, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me is the vehicle for some of the changes that we have sent up and some changes obviously proposed by others in dealing with --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the effort to link it so that people feel obliged to vote for it, or are there some things you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to separate because they need to be passed --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, on a number of occasions there have been -- Senator Menendez has on a number of occasions brought up lifting the liability cap, which obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress on with the BP escrow account.\xc2\xa0 But there certainly have been attempts at doing this in a standalone way or doing this as an amendment to a piece of legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s being considered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounded like he was talking about -- like he knew something.\xc2\xa0 I just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear what --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with those guys.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Elena Kagan, could you give us a little tick-tock about the President watching her?\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a briefing yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I suppose he was probably watching some of the statements.\xc2\xa0 And today, was he watching?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him talk about watching.\xc2\xa0 I know he met with her briefly before going up to the Senate, wishing her luck in the hearings, and continues to believe that she is -- will be a very capable Supreme Court justice, believes that she will have the support that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to be confirmed.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at -- I think -- I have not talked to him about this, but I think certainly my view of the hearings is that she is providing full, open and forthcoming testimony about issues in the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think, despite efforts by others to create a pattern of fact that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist on military recruiting at Harvard, she has explained why news accounts, why documents that were released by the Pentagon, and why students that were at Harvard and are now serving this country overseas continue to believe, as she has said, that the military had full access to the campus at Harvard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you believe that those are legitimate concerns to be raised?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been raised.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been answered.\xc2\xa0 I think there are -- look, these are Supreme Court hearings.\xc2\xa0 There are no shortage of games that are being played.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, on another topic that I continue to ask -- the Black Farmers.\xc2\xa0 Today is June 29th, and the 30th --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The 29th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, okay, good, I\xe2\x80\x99m right.\xc2\xa0 All right, June 29th, tomorrow is the 30th.\xc2\xa0 The deadline, again, comes --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is part of legislation that continues to be blocked in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lieberman said it was Republicans, how are you going to get Republicans to come in?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work with them.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to make attempts to -- look, we were talking about the economy earlier.\xc2\xa0 Contained in the tax extenders bill are tax cuts for small businesses, tax cuts for research and development, unemployment benefits for those who as a result of this recession find themselves as part of the long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has on every one of those occasions weighed in for the importance of that legislation passing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the right economic climate for this to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which part?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Black Farmers, the $1.25 billion.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this does not depend on the economic climate, this is dependent upon a settlement that has been reached.</p>\n<p>Savannah.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Phil Gordon said today that President Obama said in this reset of the relationship with Russia there would be areas of agreement and disagreement and we should see this spying issue in that context.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Savannah, I\xe2\x80\x99d want to look at Phil\xe2\x80\x99s full remarks before I comment on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration considering any diplomatic consequence to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s spying?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I said, there are -- I will let the State Department read out the conversations that have been had on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is it being considered?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The State Department can give you that answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, House Minority Leader John Boehner today likened your approach to financial regulatory reform to \xe2\x80\x9ckilling an ant with a nuclear weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I understand the analogy correctly, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, Glenn, that we understand that he apparently believes that the financial crisis -- I think the ant in that is the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether opening one\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and removing most of the doubt that you\xe2\x80\x99re completely out of touch with America in thinking that a financial crisis that caused 8.5 million jobs to be lost, the savings of tens of millions of Americans wiped out in a financial crisis, to have lives altered forever, to make that type of analogy I think demonstrates -- well, I will say it demonstrates how out of touch you are currently and it demonstrates exactly the type of mindset that he would bring to leading the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s led him to oppose an economic recovery plan that has grown our economy and brought us back from the brink of a Great Depression.</p>\n<p>It has -- he has voted against strengthening the rules that govern Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 Maybe he thinks that the rules that we had in place that caused what happened in September of 2008 are just the type of regulation Wall Street needs.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that, and I think the majority of Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t think that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick -- Bill Clinton has apparently endorsed Andrew Romanoff in the Colorado Democratic primary.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to it?\xc2\xa0 Are you amused, dismayed, infuriated?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are your choices.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 D, none of the above.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing on that?\xc2\xa0 Did you guys get a heads up?\xc2\xa0 Did you know President Clinton was doing that, the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with the political department.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did not know this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somebody in the White House might have gotten --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it affect the reset with Bill Clinton?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- I want to -- I want to, Mark, I promise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come on, come on.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of infuriated, I wanted to return to your remarks on Senator Kyl.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the White House was angry at the way he reacted after that meeting?\xc2\xa0 And is it also fair to say he\xe2\x80\x99s not about to be invited back for any meetings soon?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, he\xe2\x80\x99s a member of the leadership of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll deal with him as a member of the leadership of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was anger.\xc2\xa0 It was just that what he said wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xc2\xa0 And then, if you -- don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it, take Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Jon Kyl word for it.</p>\n<p>Now, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to what\xe2\x80\x99s happened now -- between now and Friday.\xc2\xa0 But even in Toronto, I think -- I was in Toronto; I think many of you were in Toronto.\xc2\xa0 We read the story that he told an outlet that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly what he said.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to return to this topic if and when the senator from Arizona gets his story straight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to repeat a question that was asked earlier, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I heard the answer.\xc2\xa0 Did the President or White House staff give any guidance as to the timing of these arrests?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They weren\xe2\x80\x99t -- you weren\xe2\x80\x99t given any guidance?\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you give any guidance --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, oh, oh.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- obviously, yes.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- now that the -- obviously we were aware of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll come back?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously we did not -- I am not aware of any guidance that was given to change that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you were aware -- hang on a minute.\xc2\xa0 You were aware that these arrests were going to be made, you just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the timing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We were aware of the timing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Since eight members of the U.S. Senate -- just two questions -- since eight members of the U.S. Senate wrote the President strongly opposing the possibility of his using executive power to grant amnesty to more than 10 million illegal aliens in the U.S., is the President still planning to extend any such amnesty?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Through what means in that letter?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he could pardon -- he could pardon them, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But there are no pending 10 million pardon requests, Lester.\xc2\xa0 I can clear that up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It would be a heck of a fine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to the unanimous jury decision in the U.S. District Court for eastern Pennsylvania in support of the Boy Scouts and against the Philadelphia City Council who tried to bar them from their long-time headquarters?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to find this surprising, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the details of the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was widely reported.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It missed my desk.\xc2\xa0 It missed my desk.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t read very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say, Lester, you and I probably don\xe2\x80\x99t read the same things, yes.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was General McChrystal fired partly because of a very pessimistic briefing that he gave to NATO a few days before the Rolling Stone article?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 First of all, obviously the President accepted General McChrystal\xe2\x80\x99s resignation last week.\xc2\xa0 I think General McChrystal has always provided in the Situation Room the best information that he has available to him about developments in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That obviously played -- whatever was said in that briefing played no role in the actions that General McChrystal came in and provided his resignation to the President on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this very negative briefing that he gave to NATO did not play into it at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, it did not play into it at all.\xc2\xa0 I think it is safe that the President has heard both encouraging and discouraging news and hears that each and every day about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We have always said that this was going to be quite difficult.\xc2\xa0 So that obviously has played no role in anything that\xe2\x80\x99s happened here, and again, I would say to you, going back to the premise of your question, I think the events of last week played out I think quite clearly for the world to see -- General McChrystal came in and offered to the President, and the President accepted, his resignation as our commander in Afghanistan and ISAF\xe2\x80\x99s commander in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We sent General Petreaus -- we sent his name up.\xc2\xa0 His hearings are ongoing, and I believe he will be confirmed as both our -- the commander of our forces and ISAF forces, and will soon head to that region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned if General Petreaus wants to free up the troops to be able to use more force more liberally in Afghanistan that the ensuing possibility of civilian casualties might turn the Afghans against us?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that I\xe2\x80\x99d let General Petreaus\xe2\x80\x99s comments on the rules of engagement -- I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to what he said on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously anybody that is commanding troops is going to take into their thought process a lot of different aspects involving rules of engagement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 During the joint press session with President Medvedev on Thursday, the President made reference to the fact President Medvedev had opened a Twitter account, and as the President himself has one, that some day they would be tweeting and possibly replace the red phones that they\xe2\x80\x99re using.\xc2\xa0 Have they been in touch at all since the events that happened on Saturday either by Twitter or the phone?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was quite the lead, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure where the whole beginning of that was going.\xc2\xa0 I do not know the nature of how many times they might have spoken Sunday in Toronto.\xc2\xa0 They have not been in touch, that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, yesterday or today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any red phones in the White House?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I have found.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you aware of the timing -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to -- just to close up one loop.\xc2\xa0 Were you aware of the timing of this arrest before the Medvedev visit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I will consult everyone\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you were aware of the timing of the arrests before Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s visit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I will check his Twitter account.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:50 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
