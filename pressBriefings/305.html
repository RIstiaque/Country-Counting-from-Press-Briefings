Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy April Fools.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t come bearing any tricks today.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started let me just mention one quick item, which is I know many of you are closely following the ongoing negotiations out in Lausanne, Switzerland; we are, too.\xc2\xa0 As you saw, the President, prior to the conclusion of his day here at the White House yesterday, sat down with his national security team here in Washington and, via secure video teleconference, got an update from the negotiating team out in Switzerland about the latest on the talks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has already been briefed again this morning.\xc2\xa0 That briefing was required because the negotiating teams have been hard at work since early this morning Europe time.\xc2\xa0 I do not have with me any sort of update in terms of the status of those talks or a schedule for those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Updates along those lines are updates that you can expect from the team that\'s out in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>So with that preamble, and some might even consider it a warning, I\'ll go straight to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you were able to at least describe the talks in terms of making progress -- making enough progress to continue on past this March 31st deadline.\xc2\xa0 Are we in a place right now where that progress is continuing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The sense that we have is, yes, that the talks continue to be productive and that progress is being made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'ve observed several times over the last few weeks that we have been at this for more than a year now, and the time has come for the Iranian negotiators to begin to make the kinds of serious commitments that the international community, including the United States, will insist upon.\xc2\xa0 Those are commitments related to demonstrating that they have shut down every single path to a nuclear weapon and indicating a clear commitment to cooperating with an intrusive set of inspections.\xc2\xa0 And while the talks have been productive, we have not yet received the specific, tangible commitments that the international community seeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So yesterday when you described the productivity and the progress in the talks, you said as long as that continued you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to go into Wednesday, today.\xc2\xa0 If the progress continues today and there\xe2\x80\x99s no deal by the end of the day -- we\'re early evening in Switzerland right now -- are you willing to go into Thursday or later into this week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any update on the schedule simply because it still is in the evening in Switzerland and they\xe2\x80\x99re still working on this.\xc2\xa0 I would not -- I think our approach to these conversations hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, which is that as long as we are in a position of convening serious talks that are making progress, that we would not arbitrarily or abruptly end them.\xc2\xa0 But if we are in a situation where we sense that the talks have stalled, then, yes, the United States and the international community is prepared to walk away, because we\'ve been very clear about what kinds of commitments we expect and we\'ve been clear about those kinds of commitments for in excess of a year.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to oversimplify what we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with here.\xc2\xa0 This is a very complicated situation and we want to be sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re clear about the details; the details in the situation matter significantly.</p>\n<p>So those talks in Switzerland are ongoing and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to monitor them from here.\xc2\xa0 But for updates on the schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for those announcements to be made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I\'m getting it right, because it\'s just an important point.\xc2\xa0 If we get to the end of today and there is no agreement, but there is still progress, will it extend into tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, any type of schedule update like that would come from the negotiators.\xc2\xa0 And I am at this point reluctant to fast-forward to what would happen at the end of the day if an agreement is not reached, because they are still discussing an agreement right now as we speak.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of those ongoing negotiations.</p>\n<p>But I do think it\'s fair for you to assume that the approach that we demonstrated yesterday is one that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to demonstrate, which is placing a priority on the productive nature of the talks and trying to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s guidance or mandate was to Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz in the call yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you a lot of clarity about what the President provided to them simply because they had a pretty detailed, robust discussion about the ongoing negotiations with the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 And so to give you insight into what instructions the President had would be talking about some of the core elements of the negotiations, which I have gone to great lengths to avoid doing.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve avoided that for another year, so I\'m going to try to avoid that for another day today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And if I could just get you quickly to give us any White House reaction to Governor Hutchinson in Arkansas coming out today and calling for changes to his state\xe2\x80\x99s religious objections bill.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation.\xc2\xa0 We saw pretty strong criticism, including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas, expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably -- or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that certainly is not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to, and I think Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made pretty clear what our views are on that.</p>\n<p>Jeff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, was the U.S. threat to walk away from the Iran talks real, or is that a negotiation ploy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, all I can do is reiterate to you what our position has been, which is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear -- and when I say we, I mean the international community, the United States sitting at that table alongside our German, French, British, Russian and Chinese counterparts, making clear to the Iranians that they need to make some specific commitments.\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to make those commitments, then, yes, the international community would be in a position where we would be forced to consider alternatives to the approach that we have demonstrated so far.</p>\n<p>The President does continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Getting them to make commitments on their own to shut down every path to a nuclear weapon and to agree to a set of intrusive inspections is the most effective way for us to handle the situation.\xc2\xa0 But it requires the Iranians to make some serious commitments.\xc2\xa0 And they have -- those commitments at this point have not been finalized and agreed to yet.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re hard at work on, and as long as we continue to make progress in pursuit of those commitments and those agreements, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if diplomacy fails, what\xe2\x80\x99s the next step?\xc2\xa0 Sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is one of the reasons that the President has advocated pursuing diplomacy so aggressively in the first instance.\xc2\xa0 That is to say that if in the unfortunate event that diplomacy is not successful, we will continue to have a wide range of options on the table.\xc2\xa0 Those options include coordinating with the international community to put in place even tougher sanctions that would compel Iran to come back to the negotiating table, or to be more serious about the discussions.\xc2\xa0 There is, of course, a military option that\xe2\x80\x99s sitting on the table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is -- again, in the unfortunate circumstance that we could find ourselves in, which is that we\xe2\x80\x99re not able to reach an agreement, then the President will have to consider that range of options, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll do so in close consultations with our P5+1 partners.\xc2\xa0 The unity of the international community has been critical to the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made so far, but you certainly would also expect the President to consult members of Congress on this as well.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are some members of Congress who have floated the proposition that the Joint Plan of Action, the interim agreement that many Republicans initially criticized, could be one that could be extended.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a range of options that are available here.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of where we stand in the process right now, which is that talks are ongoing and we continue to make some progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There seems to be a little bit of discrepancy from the people involved in the talks about where the disagreements lie and to what extent there are still disagreements.\xc2\xa0 The Russian Foreign Minister said all key aspects have been agreed.\xc2\xa0 Others in the room are not saying that.\xc2\xa0 Can you clear that up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would observe is that if the agreement had been reached, we\xe2\x80\x99d be having a different kind of conversation right now.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a pretty clear indication, and one I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to admit to, which is that there are gaps that still remain in terms of trying to reach an agreement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the talks are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And as long as those talks continue to be productive, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and reach that diplomatic agreement.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Foreign Minister said that it was his understanding that there was going to be a text that\xe2\x80\x99s the product of this round, but that it would not have specifics in it.\xc2\xa0 Is that an acceptable outcome?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in general terms, whether you will be able to do something is really not specific.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in general terms, what I will say is that the President has already committed to discussing and sharing with Congress, with our allies, what sort of commitments Iran has made in the context of this political agreement.\xc2\xa0 And again, those are commitments that would verify that Iran had shut down every path they have to a nuclear weapon and that they would cooperate with a set of intrusive inspections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so those kinds of commitments, that kind of an agreement is one that we would be interested in sharing with others who are interested in the ongoing talks.\xc2\xa0 And that includes our allies, it includes our partners in the region.\xc2\xa0 That certainly includes members of Congress, and I think that includes all of you who seem to be particularly interested in this as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the work product would have to be specific and in writing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We would want to be as transparent as we could, and that means sharing a lot of details about what exactly Iran has committed to.\xc2\xa0 The international community has worked closely with the United States as we\xe2\x80\x99ve imposed the sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 And this is a very tough sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s compelled Iran to the negotiating table -- and that was the goal.</p>\n<p>The goal of putting in place these sanctions was to compel Iran to enter into the negotiations and reach a diplomatic agreement, so we have an obligation to discuss what sort of agreement is reached with the international community.\xc2\xa0 The same could be said of members of Congress who, on the front end, passed statutory sanctions that were then coordinated with the international community.\xc2\xa0 So members of Congress who have been involved in this effort would have a legitimate interest in understanding what sort of commitments Iran had made.\xc2\xa0 So we would want to -- and we will be, as the President has promised, sharing those commitments with Congress as well.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the ground in Switzerland, who has the authority to walk away?\xc2\xa0 Who has the authority to say, this is no longer productive?\xc2\xa0 Or does the call have to be made back to the United States to the President for the people in Switzerland to walk off away from the table?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is very close coordination that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing between the President, members of his national security team here at the White House, and the leaders of the negotiating team out in Switzerland that include obviously Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s very close coordination that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing, and the President has been apprised of where things stand in terms of the talks, and they\xe2\x80\x99re working together as they plot the path forward here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President obviously isn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xc2\xa0 Does Secretary of State Kerry have the power or the ability on the ground to say the President has given me the authority at this point to walk away, this is not productive?\xc2\xa0 Or does it have to be a break, and call back to the White House before that happens?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of talking in hypotheticals at this point, because right now you could characterize the talks as making some progress.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that if we were to reach the unfortunate point in this process where the United States had to make a decision to leave the negotiating table because Iran was not being serious, we of course would do that in coordination with the international community.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President would be involved in making a decision like that.</p>\n<p>But, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a hypothetical because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached that stage, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, separate from what may or may not happen in the next few hours, I want you to address something that Dennis Ross, who you know well, has just written in Politico, talking about his belief that what you\xe2\x80\x99re currently negotiating -- and these are his words -- \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not reflect the objective we had hoped to achieve for much of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s first term.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 By that, he means no large nuclear infrastructure within Iran; limited enrichment capability -- very limited enrichment capability; an international fuel fund providing fissile fuel for Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What Dennis Ross now writes is that, \xe2\x80\x9cAt some point, the Obama administration changed its objective from one of transforming the Iranian nuclear program to one of ensuring that it would not have a breakout time for a nuclear weapon of less than one year.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair assessment of the way this administration has changed its own self-defiant benchmarks for what constitutes success in dealing with this question and the Iranians?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as far as I can remember -- and obviously Mr. Ross was involved in a lot of these conversations in a more detailed fashion than I was -- but it has been the clear principle of the United States since President Obama took office that Iran, while President Obama is in office, will not obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And it has always been our belief that the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through diplomacy, where Iran voluntarily -- essentially on their own accord -- made some specific commitments that would make it clear to the international community that they\xe2\x80\x99re not able to obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that has been our policy from the beginning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would also readily acknowledge that the success of that policy will be judged based on what sort of an agreement is reached.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s the reason I would hesitate to get too far out in front here, because everybody, including Mr. Ross, will have an opportunity to evaluate what kind of progress we have made in fulfilling that goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to doubt that he\xe2\x80\x99s being accurate in his interpretation of what the early goals were?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think -- I haven\'t read the op-ed that he has published, and there may be people -- maybe we can follow up with you if there are specific aspects of the op-ed that don\'t reflect the recollection of others who work here.\xc2\xa0 But I do think as a general matter, what is true is that our policy when President Obama took office was to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and that the best way for us to accomplish that goal is through diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what we\'re seeking to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But that being said, there is a qualitative argument here as to what remains within Iran and the separate question of obtaining a nuclear weapon, because a lot of infrastructure remains.\xc2\xa0 The potential there is greater technologically, and the speed with which it can ultimately achieve that is less.\xc2\xa0 And what I read from Dennis Ross, is saying the original objective was to essentially make that question far less pressing by transforming what Iran had and making it far less technically possible to achieve that possession of a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So in that sense, what he\xe2\x80\x99s arguing is, in some ways the Iranians have already won at the negotiating table, achieved far more from their perspective than this administration would have originally been comfortable with.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would vigorously disagree with that conclusion, only because our principal goal, again, was to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that the most effective way for us to do that was at the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And everyone will have an opportunity once an agreement is reached, if an agreement is reached, to evaluate whether or not we\'ve accomplished that goal.</p>\n<p>But if we\'re able to get the kinds of commitments that we would like to see from the Iranians -- to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon and to see their compliance with a set of intrusive inspections measures -- that would be accomplishing the goal that we set out to achieve from the very beginning in a way that is clearly within the best interest of national security interests of the United States but also in the best interest of our closest ally in the region, Israel, and our other partners that are important to our national security in the region, including Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to communicate with the country once a decision has been made that he has communicated to the Secretary of State about whether to continue with these negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are you asking if the President will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come out and talk to us --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- speak publicly after an agreement is reached?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- whenever he\xe2\x80\x99s decided about if an agreement is reached or if the Secretary of State to come home and reassemble the strategy to see what comes next.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would anticipate that in either eventuality that you would hear from the President about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that be today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it depends on where the talks go.\xc2\xa0 But that was a clever way to ask that question, though.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Josh, given the June 30th expiration of the agreement that\'s now in place, what is the drop-dead date for completing this phase of the talks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, we continue to be in a place where the international community has been negotiating with Iran for in excess of a year, and there are very serious commitments that we\'re seeking from Iran, and we have essentially reached the ends of those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And it is time for Iran to demonstrate whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to make those serious commitments.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to explore all of these issues in great detail; that\xe2\x80\x99s been done at very high levels.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Secretary of State has himself been personally involved.</p>\n<p>It\'s also been involved -- these discussions have also been conducted at a very technical level too.\xc2\xa0 We have Secretary Moniz who has been participating in these conversations for a number of weeks now.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Moniz is one of the foremost nuclear security -- or nuclear energy experts in the world.\xc2\xa0 He also happens to be the Secretary of Energy in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s well positioned to participate in these talks in a technical way.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve had ample opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are at a point where it\'s time for Iran to make these decisions that the international community is insisting upon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned a couple of options if, in fact, the talks don\xe2\x80\x99t succeed, if they fail.\xc2\xa0 One would be, more sanctions; one would be, a military option, which you say is still on the table.\xc2\xa0 If, in fact, you do have to walk away, how quickly would those sanctions be ratcheted up?\xc2\xa0 Before June 30th, I believe?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s hard to say for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is that the Joint Plan of Action, this interim agreement that was struck over a year ago, would remain in place through June 30th.\xc2\xa0 And so there would be a -- there already would be something -- an agreement between the international community and Iran that would have some limitations on their nuclear program already.\xc2\xa0 And then --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- need more stick between now and June 30th if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get them back to the table and avert a complete abrogation of the existing agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible, but again, it will depend on the circumstances of where things stand.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s hard to speculate about that now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, there was talk yesterday of perhaps a broader wording to an interim agreement that had been hoped for by many of the parties in terms of the specificity on things like the breakout time, the number of centrifuges, the amount of uranium, of the inspections, lifting of the sanctions, things of that nature.\xc2\xa0 Is it a concern of the U.S. and your partners that Iran is trying to get away from these talks with something that\xe2\x80\x99s broader, less specific, that would cause you problems here in Washington in a couple of weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the concern is that we have made -- we have been pretty insistent, in fact, about Iran making some serious commitments that would resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program in a way that would demonstrate that they\xe2\x80\x99re not able to obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>And what we envision for essentially this week that we\xe2\x80\x99re in now is Iran reaching a political agreement with the international community whereby they would make clear, sort of as a general matter, what sort of an agreement they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to participate in.\xc2\xa0 And that would provide a framework for a more detailed agreement that would have to be negotiated by the end of June.</p>\n<p>And we would expect out of this political agreement some clarity about what exactly they are prepared to do.\xc2\xa0 But I would not anticipate a scenario where each of these details has been locked down.\xc2\xa0 The negotiations are structured in such a way that we can essentially get this topline political agreement that would impose a framework on the next round of negotiations that would delve into the technical details.\xc2\xa0 And so it\'s that sort of overarching general framework that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But at this point, everyone will have an opportunity when a deal is reached, if a deal is reached, to evaluate what exactly the commitments that Iran is willing to make in terms of that topline framework.\xc2\xa0 But what I will -- I\xe2\x80\x99m confident be in a position of saying then, if an agreement is reached, is that the details of this are important and the guidelines that we\xe2\x80\x99ve set out make it pretty clear where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed in terms of an agreement, but that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to dig into the details and make sure that every I is dotted and every T is crossed, and every decimal is not just rounded up or rounded down, but actually closely examined in terms of what sort of impact it would have on their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And those will be painstaking detailed negotiations that I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a lot of time talking about it over the course of the spring.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to that as much as I am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m becoming an expert.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>James.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 With your indulgence and that of my colleagues, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to pursue a short series on Iran, a short series on Iraq, and then one question of pure politics.</p>\n<p>On Iran, forgive me for saying so, but I think that from this podium, both yesterday and today we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some divergent messages from you as to how long the administration and the P5+1 are willing to let these negotiations last.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you stated -- I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing, but faithfully -- as long as these conversations continue to be productive, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have them.\xc2\xa0 You also stated yesterday, however, that the U.S. and its partners would not wait until June 30 to walk away, if necessary. So right there are two divergent questions -- or two divergent statements, I should say.</p>\n<p>So is it the case that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have them as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re productive, or there is actually some sort of ticking clock here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would try to help you understand, James, in terms of our position is that we do not envision a scenario where we would abruptly and arbitrarily end the talks that are productive.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, these conversations are not open-ended.\xc2\xa0 We have been serious about the way that we believe it is most effective for us to structure these negotiations, and that is to structure these negotiations in a way that a framework agreement, essentially a political agreement, could be reached by the end of March, is what we said, and April 1st now, because we want to preserve ample time -- essentially, two or three months -- for the technical experts to then sit at the table and have a conversation about how the numbers are going to work inside this broader framework agreement.</p>\n<p>And we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important to leave ample time for those conversations.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been unwilling to set a definitive, though arbitrary, date -- but at the same time try to be clear about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re not operating in an open-ended environment here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you tell us -- and you said the same thing yesterday -- that it could be negotiated, the real fine, technical details, within a two- to three-month period, if that period is two months, that would give us room for another month of negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Can we expect that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to go do this for still the whole month of April?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said two or three months.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did, I did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s two months, that gives us the whole month of April.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have -- as I mentioned earlier, we have been at this for more than a year, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear what kinds of commitments we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking from Iran, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for them to make some decisions about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to make those commitments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last on this series.\xc2\xa0 Did you mean to suggest, as I think you did earlier in this briefing, that one of the options available to the U.S. and the international community here is for the JPOA to be extended beyond June 30?\xc2\xa0 Did you mean to suggest that that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I have suggested -- what I meant to suggest is that there are some Republicans who, when asked what they would -- these are Republicans who are on the record --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about this administration and its desires.\xc2\xa0 Is the JPOA being extended on the table, or not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The context in which I brought this up is the context of what would happen if diplomacy fails, if we\xe2\x80\x99re not able to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And what some Republicans -- I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee<br/>\n\t-- Senator Corker, a number of weeks back, indicated that one approach could be leaving the Joint Plan of Action in place -- this potential agreement.</p>\n<p>So that is an option that could be in place if negotiations do not succeed.\xc2\xa0 But right now, negotiations are underway in Switzerland and they\xe2\x80\x99re making progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tikrit, can you please share with us the assessment of the United States government as to the state of the battle there, who is running the city, and the success of military operations there designed to repel ISIS from there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My colleagues at the Department of Defense can certainly give you some more details about this, but it is our assessment that Iraqi forces, under the command of the Iraqi military and the Iraqi central government, have advanced into the heart of Tikrit; that they have succeeded in taking the city center and other significant areas of the city from ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of the fact that in these kinds of military operations there could be a little bit of a back-and-forth.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress, even in just the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 And this is notable progress because you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when this operation began, it did not include the support of coalition military airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 And after a few productive days, this operation essentially got stalled in the outskirts of the city, and remained stalled for a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>Five days ago, the Iraqi military made a specific request to the United States to back their efforts with military airstrikes. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the course of the last five days that the stalemate that has previously been in place for a couple of weeks had receded, and that Iraqi security forces that were multi-sectarian in nature -- these included Shia military; these included members of the popular mobilization force; these included some tribal fighters as well -- were able to advance into the city.</p>\n<p>And this is, if you take a look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happened over the last five days, I think a pretty compelling description of the successful implementation of our strategy.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that a multi-sectarian force that\xe2\x80\x99s being led by the Iraqi military and a unified Iraqi central government, that that force would be effective but would be made even more effective when backed by coalition military airstrikes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Shia militia.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And Shia militia.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last five days.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point out that the Shia militia, though, is under the command of the Iraqi military and of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s key.\xc2\xa0 There are some Shia military units or Shia militia fighters who I think were at least ambiguous about whether or not they were under the command of the Iraqi military.\xc2\xa0 And we saw that there were some Shia militia fighters who declined to participate in the operation once coalition military airpower was involved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, again, what the United States insisted on was an operation that was multi-sectarian and under the command of the Iraqi military.\xc2\xa0 And, again, based on what\xe2\x80\x99s happened over the last five days, I think this is a pretty clear piece of evidence that this strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out is one that has some potential in terms of driving back ISIL fighters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Mosul, too?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, each of these situations is different.\xc2\xa0 And there are certainly elements of this operation that could be useful in Mosul.\xc2\xa0 This idea of ensuring that this multi-sectarian force is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s carrying out the operation, making sure that every element of that multi-sectarian force is reporting to the military command and to the Iraqi central government, and that their capabilities are enhanced when they\xe2\x80\x99re backed up by coalition airpower.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that Mosul is a much larger city than Tikrit.\xc2\xa0 There are also, based on some reporting that we see on the ground, there are also a substantially larger number of civilians inside Mosul than there have been in Tikrit.\xc2\xa0 And that makes any sort of operation like this more complicated because we obviously go to great lengths to prevent innocent civilian deaths.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Final question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve all been very patient and I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 This is the politics question.\xc2\xa0 In his remarks at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute the other day, the President lamented that our politics today are not more purposeful and elevated, to use his words, and he also lamented that too often ideology gets in the way of basic respect.\xc2\xa0 And those remarks struck me because this week we saw my CNN colleague, Dana Bash, do an interview with the Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, in which she asked him about his decision in the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign to take to the Senate floor and accuse Mitt Romney of him not paying his taxes, and demanding that Mitt Romney, in fact, prove he paid his taxes.\xc2\xa0 And when Dana Bash asked him about this, she mentioned that some people considered it McCarthyite.\xc2\xa0 And of course, no evidence has ever been produced to show that Mitt Romney failed to pay his taxes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I wonder if President Obama, who has lamented this incivility in our politics, this disrespect in our politics, has any view of Harry Reid telling Dana Bash in response to this question, well, Romney didn\xe2\x80\x99t get elected, did he?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the opportunity to talk to the President about Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s interview.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Senator Reid is somebody who is going to decide for himself about what he says on the Senate floor and he obviously is a vocal supporter of the President and they have a partnership that will go down in history as a remarkably productive one.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Senator Reid to decide what he is going to say on the House floor.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of things that Senator Reid over the course of his career I think that he has said pretty proudly were independent of the views of anybody else, they represented only his own.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s choice and his spokesman\xe2\x80\x99s choice to call out conduct unbecoming of our highest elected officials when it is, in fact, unbecoming.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to take that opportunity now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not for something that\xe2\x80\x99s three years old.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just follow up on Tikrit very briefly.\xc2\xa0 You said that obviously Iraqi forces are effective but are more effective with airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting -- or are you suggesting that Tikrit could have been taken with those forces alone, without those precision airstrikes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a counterfactual; it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know at this point.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that we had seen an operation be mobilized by the Iraqi military with Iraqi security forces in conjunction with some other loosely affiliated Shia militias that had carried out an operation against Tikrit that essentially had stalled in the outskirts of the city, or at least on the outer edges of the city.\xc2\xa0 And that had been stalled out for a couple of weeks, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only in the last five days that coalition military airstrikes were carried out and that military forces under the command of the Iraqi military and the Iraqi central government did advance into the city.\xc2\xa0 And that did cause, apparently, ISIL fighters to withdraw.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, there can always be a little back-and-forth in these kinds of military operations, but what is clear is that over the last five days, this strategy of backing up Iraqi security forces that are multi-sectarian in nature with coalition military airstrikes is a pretty potent combination.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you really quickly about Iran.\xc2\xa0 And you said that the President wants to be clear, he wants to be able to share with Congress, with the American people, be able to essentially make his case for this deal, if there is a deal.\xc2\xa0 So would that suggest that whatever statement that might come out of this would have to have some specificity?\xc2\xa0 Understanding it\'s not going to be completely detailed, but would it have to have some specificity and be a written statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would expect -- again, I don\'t want to prejudge the outcome here, but we certainly would expect -- the whole point of this exercise has been for Iran to demonstrate their willingness to make serious commitments to the international community about their nuclear program and ensuring that they do not obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And so we would expect for those serious commitments to be made soon, because we\'ve been doing this for more than a year now, and the President expects to be in a position to talk publicly about what sort of commitments Iran has made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So in what form that takes, we\'ll have to see, if an agreement is reached, but that\'s what our expectation is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not necessarily a written statement that the Iranians sign off on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\'s hard to imagine the President going out and making the case that, well, this is just what the Iranians have told me they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do.\xc2\xa0 I think you can certainly expect that the President would expect a more serious commitment from the Iranians than that in order to move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 Jason Chaffetz, late yesterday, issued subpoenas commanding the testimony from those two Secret Service agents who were involved in this recent incident where a bomb scene -- an active bomb scene was breached.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration resist those subpoenas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately this will be a decision that will be made by the Department of Homeland Security and by the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 The fact that the Director of the Secret Service, over the last couple of weeks, has appeared before Congress at least three times I think is an indication of their willingness to cooperate with legitimate oversight.\xc2\xa0 That same Director has also referred this specific matter to the inspector general to ensure a genuinely independent investigation into what occurred that evening.</p>\n<p>So I think that indicates a pretty clear commitment on the part of the leadership of the Secret Service to both cooperating with legitimate congressional oversight and actually getting to the bottom of what happened that night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you know, part of the concern of some members of that committee has been that because the director said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to interfere with the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s investigation -- he did not have all the facts, he did not do the questioning, he did not speak to all the people involved.\xc2\xa0 So while he, indeed, as you have said, has gone before the committee, their argument is that they need to be able to speak to the people directly involved.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that it\'s not unprecedented for inspectors general to go before Congress and to talk about the results of their investigation.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, there is an independent inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security that\xe2\x80\x99s conducting this investigation.\xc2\xa0 So that independent inspector general will conduct this investigation and that person will have to decide whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to testify before Congress about their findings.</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask about a couple of subjects.\xc2\xa0 On Iran, can you explain the military option as the United States is still trying to find out the arsenal -- the weapons arsenal that Iran has?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I\'m not prepared to talk in great detail about what sort of specific military options the President would consider other than to say that a military option is among those that\xe2\x80\x99s on the table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One of the down sides, however, of the military option is that it would have less of an impact in terms of setting back Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program than the kind of diplomatic agreement that we currently envision.\xc2\xa0 We also know that the diplomatic agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reach is one that would include intrusive inspections that would give the international community great insight into the scope of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we know that a military action would have the opposite of that effect, right?\xc2\xa0 That if Iran were in a position where they were subject to military action it seems very likely that they would kick all the inspectors out of the country.\xc2\xa0 And that would, moving forward, have less insight into the size and scope of their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>So that is why the President makes aggressively the case, as I have, that the diplomatic path is the most effective way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hear what you\'re saying, but I\'m trying to marry the issue of potential -- what possibly could happen -- the military option is on the table, even though you say that it\'s not as effective as sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But then you have an issue that you don\'t have the intelligence that we would like on what kind of weapons they have.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t a military option, a potential military option just cancel all of that out, because we do not know what they have?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, right now we do have more insight into their nuclear program probably than we ever have because of this Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 This interim agreement, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, included wide-ranging inspections, and that has provided greater insight into the size and scope of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 That is, after all, the basis for a lot of these discussions, that as we sort of talk about what their nuclear program looks like now and what it would look like under a diplomatic agreement is rooted in the fact that we have some basic knowledge of their program.</p>\n<p>And what we would envision is a diplomatic agreement that would, again, cut off every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon, but also give intrusive access to international inspectors so that they can verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with that agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another subject, the commutation letter that was issued yesterday from the White House.\xc2\xa0 Many of those whose sentences were commuted, they were drug sentencing, drug convictions.\xc2\xa0 Is this part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s idea of bringing that disparity gap and sentencing -- particularly when it comes the crack cocaine versus power cocaine from 100 to 1 to 18 to 1<br/>\n\t-- is this part of that effort that he\xe2\x80\x99s employing trying to bridge the gap in sentencing disparity?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can say as a general matter, April, that the people who received commutations from the President yesterday were individuals who -- or at least the vast majority of them -- were individuals who would have faced a different sentence had their sentence been considered under current law.\xc2\xa0 And this is just one example of the kinds of disparities that exist in our criminal justice system, and it\'s why the President is working in bipartisan fashion on legislation that would resolve some of those inequities.\xc2\xa0 And this would have consequences not just for the just way in which our laws are applied, but also have some consequences for public safety and even for the finances of our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of reasons for Democrats and Republicans to be interested in this issue, and the President -- foremost in the mind of the President is making sure that our criminal justice system lives up to our own commitment as a country to being one that\'s both impartial and fair.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this one of those gaps the President is trying to close?\xc2\xa0 Like he said on the way to Selma when he talked to the black journalists on the flight down --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You were one of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I sure was.\xc2\xa0 And this is kind of going along with the question I asked and his answer.\xc2\xa0 He said that his job now is to basically bridge the gaps of the racial divide that\xe2\x80\x99s still going on in the country.\xc2\xa0 Is this one of those gaps he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to -- the racial gaps that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to close?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are certainly concerns, broadly, in our justice system about fairness, and some of them do relate to questions of race.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is the President believes -- and, fortunately, there are Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who also believe -- that there are some common-sense changes that we can make to our justice system that will make it more fair.\xc2\xa0 And the President is interested in having that conversation and trying to advance that goal.</p>\n<p>The tool of commutations is just one that the President can use to try to add some more fairness and justice to that system. But there are some legislative changes that could also be made that would have an even more profound effect on the system.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this business of the deadline -- and I understand that you\'re saying that while progress is being made why bring it to a halt, but can you just explain the logic of not putting an end to this phase?\xc2\xa0 Because there was a logic in making a deadline in the first place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not give them until this amount of time to show that they\xe2\x80\x99re serious about those commitments?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Michelle, the reason for that simply is that the -- we\'re at the end of the negotiations as it relates to trying to reach a political agreement, and it is time for Iran to demonstrate whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to make these serious commitments that the international community has been asking for.\xc2\xa0 And it is, in the mind of the President and the broader international community, that this is the best way for us to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon, but it\'s going to require Iran to make some serious commitments.\xc2\xa0 And after negotiating for more than a year, it\'s essentially time for Iran to make that decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re not serious enough to make that decision when we gave them an endpoint.\xc2\xa0 And it seems like we\'re giving them leeway here -- no?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think what we are insisting on is we are insisting on a good deal.\xc2\xa0 And if Iran is serious about fulfilling -- making these commitments and is serious about trying to reach an agreement with the international community around the negotiating table, the time has come for them to make that decision.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve heard from Iran publicly has been it wouldn\'t be the end of the world if no deal was reached.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of their stockpile, they say, well, no, no, no, we\'re not going to move our stockpile.\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying publicly is that there are certain points on which they\xe2\x80\x99re not that serious.\xc2\xa0 I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that what is said publicly is not the same as what goes on in negotiations.\xc2\xa0 But are we getting a lot of indication from Iran that they\xe2\x80\x99re just not that serious?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I think we\'ll be able to evaluate whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re serious based on what an agreement looks like, if we\'re able to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 I think that will be the best way for us all to judge.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully we\'ll have that opportunity relatively soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, quickly -- we heard from France this morning saying that Iran is not where they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be at this point.\xc2\xa0 They just sounded very pessimistic about the progress that has been made.\xc2\xa0 They said, yeah, there\xe2\x80\x99s progress, but not on those specific points.\xc2\xa0 So can you just tell us why, on the progress that has been made, you sound much more optimistic than some of the other partners sound?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s hard for me to account for exactly the comments that were made, presumably in French, by the French foreign minister.\xc2\xa0 What I\'ll say is what has contributed significantly to the leverage of the international community is our unity on this measure; that the international community broadly is united in insisting that Iran make serious commitments to resolve our concerns with their nuclear program and to verify that they will not obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And our negotiating position has been firm.</p>\n<p>And I know that there is some reporting that indicates that, well, maybe the fact that we\'re a day past the deadline is an indication that the international community is really eager for an agreement.\xc2\xa0 I actually would posit to you that the reason that we\'re a day past the deadline is because the international community is insisting on a good deal, and that we\'re going to drive a hard bargain and we\'re going to expect Iran to make serious commitments.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to give them the opportunity to do so, but if they don\'t, the international community alongside the United States is prepared to walk away and consider some alternatives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At this point, you\'re optimistic, even given where we are now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if I would go that far.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is that we have made progress in recent days, but the reason that there\xe2\x80\x99s not an agreement is because there continue to be differences on some important issues.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s only through resolving those differences that we\'ll be able to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And time will tell whether or not that is possible, but based on the amount of time that has already been expended and dedicated to these negotiations, that time is coming soon.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, one domestic question, and I want to follow up on what Michelle was asking you.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s explanation, or what explanation can you share for why the representatives from France, China and Russia departed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them about what sort of scheduling matters they had to deal with.\xc2\xa0 The one thing I will observe about the French foreign minister is that his flight to Lausanne is pretty brief, so it\'s much easier for him to go back and forth than it is for my American counterparts, who are doing yeomen\xe2\x80\x99s work over in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in no way does the President want us to believe that their departure signals a lack of progress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I would not interpret it that way.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be in touch with all of our intelligence partners even if they are not represented at the foreign minister level in these talks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are there any other conversations that the President has had with heads of state regarding the Iran talks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of today.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to give you greater insight into that we\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And one other follow-up on Iran, and I have a domestic question, and that is there was a lot of Twitter chatter last night that what today was going to be about was actually drafting.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to clarify that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s understanding about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Switzerland is negotiating or drafting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would only -- because I\'m reluctant to get into a lot of detail about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening behind closed doors in Switzerland, I think I would only point out that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a significant difference between those two verbs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s possible that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s possible to do both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To do both?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s possible to negotiate as you draft, or to draft as you negotiate, I suppose.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to know.\xc2\xa0 Domestic question -- the President is going to be visiting Kentucky and Utah, two nice states but not necessarily states that we\xe2\x80\x99d expect him to advance his news and agenda.\xc2\xa0 So can you lift the veil on what he hopes to achieve with his town halls in those two states?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details about these visits, but certainly the President is looking forward to the opportunity to drawing a pretty stark contrast between his middle-class economics approach to expanding opportunity for everybody, and the approach advocated by Republicans, which essentially is a top-down approach.\xc2\xa0 And I do think you can expect the President to repeat his concerns about at least one aspect of the Republican plan, which is the elimination of the estate tax.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Just a reminder to everybody, this is an estate tax provision that would essentially offer a tax break that\xe2\x80\x99s targeted only at estates worth in excess of $11 million.\xc2\xa0 And this is a tax loophole that Republicans are seeking to carve out that would actually cost $300 billion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that that is a fiscally responsible approach.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s particularly ironic that a day or two after Republicans proudly voted on a budget that they said balanced, that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to blow a hole in the deficit just so they could extend tax breaks to people worth more than $11 million.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is one way that the President could illustrate the difference in approach between Democrats and Republicans on economic issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s Kentucky?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will have an opportunity to make that point in both places, I believe.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question on Iran and also RFRA.\xc2\xa0 You said that if the talks fall apart you\xe2\x80\x99d consult with your allies about tougher sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I thought that the administration had argued in the past that if these talks fell apart, it would be hard to keep the international solidarity on sanctions together.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The concern that we have had was if the United States could be blamed for the talks falling apart, then it would be hard to preserve international unity around the implementation of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But in this scenario, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that we\xe2\x80\x99ve given Iran every opportunity to make the kinds of serious commitments that the international community expects.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, if we\xe2\x80\x99re not able to reach an agreement, I think the international community would, understandably, hold Iran responsible for that shortcoming.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on RFRA.\xc2\xa0 In Arkansas, the governor sent the law back for a rewrite, basically, and then in Indiana, the governor has asked for clarification.\xc2\xa0 Does the President, as a constitutional lawyer, believe that it is possible to allow private businesses to not perform certain services for gay couples without it being discrimination?\xc2\xa0 In other words, is this a circle that can be squared, or not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him. I do think that in the mind of the President, the thought that we would have state legislatures in the 21st century in the United States of America passing laws that would use religion to try to justify discriminating against people because of who they love is unthinkable.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an outcry -- again not just from Democrats.\xc2\xa0 This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a partisan or even a particularly political dispute.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s business interests; it\xe2\x80\x99s other Republicans, it\xe2\x80\x99s other leaders in the faith community who have stepped forward and said -- particularly in the case of Indiana -- that this law is a terrible idea.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not good for our state, it\'s not consistent with our values.\xc2\xa0 And I think that outcry is what has prompted Governor Pence to reevaluate the wisdom of signing this bill into law, something he did just a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s also what has made Governor Hutchinson so reluctant to sign this bill and to actually send it back to the legislature so they could do some additional work on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t see this in any way analogous to the kind of carve-out or opt-out you\xe2\x80\x99ve offered to religious institutions on contraception, for instance?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this matter is broadly different for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Toluse.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for that, Josh.\xc2\xa0 In the past, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how different people who have been looking at these negotiations have cherry-picked different parts of the negotiation as they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to oppose it.\xc2\xa0 If we do reach a deal, you mentioned it\'s going to be incredibly complex.\xc2\xa0 How is the President or the administration going to get across the parts of the deal to the American public so that people understand it? And how will you counter the folks who are going to maybe cherry-pick the parts of the deal that people might not like?\xc2\xa0 How are you going to go about rolling this out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, some of that is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be counting on all of you to tell the truth about what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to spend some time talking to all of you about what the details are of the agreement and what consequences that would have for our national security.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing I guess I should clarify is that the agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reach right now is a political one, so essentially, it would be a generalized framework.\xc2\xa0 And while the issues that are at play here are complicated, what we\xe2\x80\x99re envisioning is a pretty general framework that somebody who spends some time looking at it should be able to understand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Down the line when we get to June and we start negotiating\xc2\xa0 -- or we, hopefully, end negotiating over the very technical details, that\xe2\x80\x99s when we\xe2\x80\x99re going to enter a phase where the scientific details are pretty complicated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The other thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out -- and this is I guess something else that you could be on the lookout for in the days ahead if an agreement is reached -- is that I would anticipate that we will make not just a public case to try to persuade you and the American people and members of Congress and our allies that this is clearly in the national security interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also have a scientific case to make that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make a pretty forceful case that, looking at the science, we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached an agreement that has effectively prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that will be part of the explanation and description that we\xe2\x80\x99ll offer to all of you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the deadline and sort of the decision to push the deadline past yesterday, is that in part a negotiating tactic that if this fails, you will, as you mentioned earlier, sort of be able to put it on Iran and not -- it won\xe2\x80\x99t be blamed on the U.S. having this hard arbitrary deadline?\xc2\xa0 Is that part of the tactic?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what is clear is that Iran, now and over the course of talks that have lasted over a year, has had every opportunity to make the kinds of commitments that the international community expects.\xc2\xa0 And, again, these are commitments that would shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon and comply with intrusive inspections that would ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re living up to the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve had every opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 And while talks continues to progress and while they continue to be productive, they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 But this is not an open-ended commitment to talking that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to make here; that the time has come for Iran to make some decisions.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick question on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 There were some talks yesterday between Cuba and the U.S. about human rights.\xc2\xa0 Did any progress come out of those talks?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the idea that Cuba is bringing up issues like police brutality and poverty and also Guantanamo as human rights shortfalls by the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a readout of those conversations, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if there\xe2\x80\x99s something that we can share with you on that regard.</p>\n<p>Pamela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive order today regarding the financial sanctions against hackers, was there any effort, or might there be any effort in the future, to bring in the international community to join in sanctions like that, given that the threat crosses borders, could involve multinational corporations and that kind of thing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the goal of this executive order that the President signed today is geared toward giving him an additional tool that can be used in response to significant acts of -- significant malicious acts in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 And the idea here is that we want to make sure that whatever sort of response to those kinds of acts when they\xe2\x80\x99re carried out is proportional. And this would be a set of tools that the President could use to respond to significant malicious acts in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is mindful of the threats that continue to exist in cyberspace, and these are threats that are related to cyber intrusions that occur in the private sector.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen health care companies and financial institutions be victims of these kinds of intrusions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are even some media outlets that have been victimized by some of these attacks.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously government networks that have also been subjected to some malicious activity in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of all of that, and we want to make sure that the U.S. government has the resources and the tools necessary to respond forcefully to those incidents.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea behind this executive order.</p>\n<p>And I guess to get directly to your question, this is the kind of thing that other countries are looking at, too, in terms of understanding that their countries, that their governments and companies that are located in their countries are similarly vulnerable to these kinds of actions and that a coordinated response across the international community is one that makes those responses more effective.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They also serve as a more effective deterrent as well, and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the goal here.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that when the President does meet with other heads of state, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for him to talk about cybersecurity, and I could certainly anticipate a scenario where he would discuss this proposed response as well.</p>\n<p>Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress appears prepared to act either way the talks conclude.\xc2\xa0 So is it fair to say that you guys would support sanctions legislation that the President has said he would veto in the past while the talks are ongoing?\xc2\xa0 And if there is, in fact, a deal, are you guys open and willing to work with Congress on shaping some kind of legislation that you can live with, either in the interim period from now until June 30th or after?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Carol, what we would encourage members of Congress to do is a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made this case pretty aggressively -- you alluded to it -- that we do not believe it is in the best interest of the talks for Congress to take action on additional sanctions while talks are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have been strongly opposed to some of the legislative proposals that have been floated so far.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be strongly opposed to those, again, for reasons that Mara sort of highlighted, which is that that would run contrary to the terms of the interim agreement, the so-called Joint Plan of Action that was reached more than a year ago.</p>\n<p>If we do reach an agreement, sort of this political agreement, we would encourage members of Congress to evaluate that agreement on its merits.\xc2\xa0 And I referred yesterday to this idea that it will require members of Congress to sort of set aside their partisan interest and try to keep the national interest at the front of their mind, and to evaluate whether or not the President has followed through on the commitment that he has made to use diplomacy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President has been clear to his negotiating team that we\xe2\x80\x99re only going to take a good deal, and one in which Iran makes the necessary serious commitments to resolve the concerns of the international community.\xc2\xa0 And so we will certainly have that conversation with members of Congress if a deal is reached when they return to Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If one is not, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll back the legislation -- some of the legislation that you currently oppose, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if a deal is not reached, there are a range of options on the table, including some options that Republicans -- well, or that members of Congress in both parties, frankly, have sought to put on the table now.\xc2\xa0 We have opposed many of those provisions because we\xe2\x80\x99ve said they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on the table while we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, yes, if those negotiations break down and the Iranians walk away without demonstrating the willingness to make some serious commitments, then that does bring some of those issues back into play.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate that when we come to it.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much, Josh.\xc2\xa0 In light of this tragic plane crash, would the President favor lifting privacy restrictions on pilots, train conductors, bus drivers, doctors, even White House press secretaries -- anybody who holds the public interest in their hands?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are obviously matters where it\xe2\x80\x99s important for independent regulators to balance a couple of competing interests.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, first and foremost in their mind is ensuring the interest of the traveling public.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the FAA, the NTSB and other agencies like that have in place regulations that are related to the health and well-being of train conductors and airline pilots.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, those individuals, just because they are in that business, don\xe2\x80\x99t give up all of their right to privacy.\xc2\xa0 And trying to strike that right balance is an important public policy question and certainly one that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the FAA spends a lot of time on.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the FAA, when it comes to airline pilots, does have regulations that requires pilots over the age of 40 to submit to a medical examination once every six months to ensure that they are fit to fly an aircraft that has members of the traveling public on it.\xc2\xa0 And those kinds of health care examinations include a component dedicated to their psychological health, as well.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate policy response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think this whole HIPAA system, this health care privacy system should be reevaluated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have made that kind of pronouncement.</p>\n<p>Dave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about military retirement pay.\xc2\xa0 The President sent a letter to the congressional leaders a couple days ago about the recommendations of an independent commission on military retirement pay, and said it was an important step forward to preserving the system, but he also wants the White House to work on refining some of the proposals.\xc2\xa0 Can you outline in any more specificity what areas of concern the White House has about those recommendations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Dave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess I\xe2\x80\x99m aware generally of this issue but not of the finer points of our position on this.\xc2\xa0 But let me have somebody follow up with you.\xc2\xa0 We can do that with you today.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good Wednesday.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:06 P.M.
