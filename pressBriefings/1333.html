GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do this in a little bit different order.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to start today with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey to announce a new round of Iran sanctions and designations.</p>\n<p>And for any of those that are interested, Stuart, and Bob Einhorn from the State Department, will be doing a pen and pad briefing on this later this afternoon at the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>Mr. Secretary.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Over the past year, President Obama has pursued a broad international strategy to address the world\xe2\x80\x99s concerns over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 A critical step in that strategy came last week when the United Nations Security Council adopted the toughest sanctions ever imposed on the Iranian government.</p>\n<p>Today, the United States is taking our first steps to implement and build on that resolution.\xc2\xa0 We are adding to our list of sanction entities a number of institutions and individuals who are helping Iran finance nuclear and missile programs and to evade international sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Our actions today are designed to deter other governments and foreign financial institutions from dealing with these entities and thereby supporting Iran\xe2\x80\x99s illicit activities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me briefly describe each of these actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First, we are designating Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Post Bank for its support of proliferation activities.\xc2\xa0 This brings the number of Iranian-owned banks on our list to 16.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Second, we are adding five front companies and more than 90 ship names that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s national maritime carrier has been using to try to evade sanctions.</p>\n<p>Third, we are adding two individuals and four entities that are part of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Revolutionary Guard, which as you know, plays a key role in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile programs and its support for terrorism.</p>\n<p>Fourth, we are adding two individuals and two entities that are actively involved in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear or missile programs.\xc2\xa0 And finally, we are identifying 22 petroleum, energy, and insurance companies, located inside and outside Iran, which are owned or controlled by the Iranian government.</p>\n<p>Now, shortly, Stuart Levey, who is Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, is going to walk you through the details of these actions.\xc2\xa0 Stuart Levey, as you know, has been the chief architect of our strategy to impose growing financial costs on Iran for its continued defiance, and he has played a major leadership role on this issue internationally.</p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, we will continue to increase the financial pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to target Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to focus on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Revolutionary Guard.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to expose Iran\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to evade international sanctions.</p>\n<p>Now, to be truly effective in ending Iran\xe2\x80\x99s proliferation activities and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorism, we need to have in place a concerted international approach.\xc2\xa0 This is not something the United States can do alone.\xc2\xa0 We need other countries to move with us.\xc2\xa0 So alongside our efforts in the U.N. to build international support for sanctions, we have been working behind the scenes building support among finance ministries for additional actions to prevent abuse of the global financial system by Iran.\xc2\xa0 We expect to see additional actions announced by other governments soon.</p>\n<p>The types of steps we are taking today have been remarkably effective.\xc2\xa0 When major financial institutions, companies around the world, discover they are actually working with Iranian companies that support Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear or missile programs, they realize it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth the risk; they cut off their business.\xc2\xa0 And over the years, these steps have made a major difference in limiting Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ability to use the global financial system to finance, to pursue illicit activities.</p>\n<p>We made important progress, but we cannot stop here.\xc2\xa0 Iran will never cease looking for ways to evade our sanctions, so our efforts must be ongoing and unrelenting.\xc2\xa0 And we will keep working on ways to intensify financial pressure on Iran.</p>\n<p>Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to give you Stuart.</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As Secretary Geithner said, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking a series of steps today to impose additional consequences on Iran for its continued failure to meet its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 First, we\xe2\x80\x99re sanctioning an additional Iranian bank, Post Bank.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At one time, Post Bank\xe2\x80\x99s business was conducted almost entirely within Iran.\xc2\xa0 But when some of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks were exposed for financing proliferation, Iran began to use Post Bank to facilitate international trade.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Post Bank stepped into the shoes of Bank Sepah, which is under United Nations sanctions, to carry out Bank Sepah\xe2\x80\x99s transactions and hide its identity.\xc2\xa0 International banks that would never deal with Bank Sepah have been handling these transactions that they think are really for Post Bank.</p>\n<p>Second, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking additional action today against Iran\xe2\x80\x99s national maritime carrier, or IRISL.\xc2\xa0 Since we first sanctioned IRISL in 2008, it has desperately attempted to evade those sanctions -- setting up new front companies, renaming and reflagging and even repainting its vessels to hide their true ownership.\xc2\xa0 Despite its deceptive maneuvers, IRISL has had to struggle to obtain insurance and other services that it needs.\xc2\xa0 It has also been caught violating U.N. Security Council sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Our actions today expose IRISL\xe2\x80\x99s deception and make it more difficult for IRISL to carry out illegal activities.</p>\n<p>Third, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking further action against the IRGC, or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\xc2\xa0 The IRGC, as the Secretary said, plays a key role in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile program and its support for terrorism, and it has also taken over broad portions of the Iranian economy to the detriment of the Iranian people.\xc2\xa0 With today\xe2\x80\x99s designations, we have now sanctions 26 entities and individuals connected to the IRGC, and we will continue to do so. No IRGC entity should have any place in the world\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate financial system.</p>\n<p>Fourth, we\xe2\x80\x99re sanctioning two individuals and two entities for proliferation, including a key Iranian broker used to procure a variety of nuclear-related equipment.</p>\n<p>And finally, we\xe2\x80\x99re identifying 22 petroleum, energy, and insurance companies that are owned and controlled by the government of Iran.\xc2\xa0 Many of them, though -- 17, in fact -- are located outside of Iran and may not be easily identifiable as being Iranian.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Americans have long been forbidden from doing business with Iranian entities, but increasingly companies around the world are deciding not to do business with the government of Iran because of its wide range of illicit conduct, and because, as President Obama said last week, it is a government that has brutally suppressed dissent and murdered the innocent.</p>\n<p>The United Nations has also highlighted proliferation concerns surrounding Iran\xe2\x80\x99s energy sector, and all companies must be conscious of the implications of any trade that they conduct with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s energy companies.</p>\n<p>We know that officials in Iran have been anxious about this new round of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 If the Iranian government holds true to form, it will scramble to identify work-arounds, hiding behind front companies, doctoring wire transfers, falsifying shipping documents.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to expose this deception, as we are today, and thereby reinforce the very reasons why the private sector around the world is increasingly shunning Iran.</p>\n<p>We will also work to ensure that international sanctions are enforced.\xc2\xa0 In this regard, the State Department has dedicated a senior official, Bob Einhorn, to ensure that we accomplish this in cooperation with our friends and partners around the world.\xc2\xa0 We are very fortunate to have someone of Bob\xe2\x80\x99s stature and experience working on this issue.</p>\n<p>The overall result of these efforts is that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s choice will be increasingly clear -- to choose the path offered by President Obama and the international community, or to remain on a course that leads to further isolation.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Stuart has got time for a couple of questions on Iran sanctions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sir, the general sense in some -- in terms of the government of Iran is that these sanctions are targeting the people.\xc2\xa0 What assurances can you give the people of Iran that what you\xe2\x80\x99re rolling out today and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done at the U.N. and other places is not targeting the people?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And secondly, the Iranians knew that this was probably coming -- they knew that the U.N. sanctions were coming, so they probably have taken steps.\xc2\xa0 What are you doing in response to those steps?\xc2\xa0 Does it make your job that much more difficult to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re targeting the people you want to target, as opposed to others?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 Excellent question.\xc2\xa0 In fact, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, we have no problem or dispute with the people of Iran.\xc2\xa0 Quite the contrary.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the government of Iran and the decisions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made that we have a problem with.\xc2\xa0 And we do try to focus our sanctions on the decision-makers.\xc2\xa0 We do this in two ways -- one by focusing on those engaged in the actual illicit activity, those -- part of the nuclear program, the missile program, support for terrorism.</p>\n<p>And secondly, our focus on the Revolutionary Guard I think is quite consistent with this.\xc2\xa0 The Revolutionary Guard, as you may know, not only is engaged in illicit activity, but it\xe2\x80\x99s taking economic opportunities from the people of Iran.\xc2\xa0 We think that by focusing attention on the Revolutionary Guard, as we did at the United Nations, and as we have both unilaterally and with our partners around the world, that we\xe2\x80\x99re sending exactly the right message.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going after the people who are oppressing the people of Iran, oppressing them politically and economically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question, they have obviously known that this was coming.</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, in fact, they undoubtedly did.\xc2\xa0 The whole world knew it was coming.\xc2\xa0 The beauty of the kinds of measures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking is that when Iran engages in evasive conduct and deceptive conduct, as they undoubtedly will, we use that our advantage by exposing the evasive conduct, the deceptive conduct, and then making that public for the whole world to see.</p>\n<p>When we do that, the private sector -- it reinforces this dynamic where the private sector already doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do business with Iran.\xc2\xa0 They then see that Iran is taking action that has a risk of bringing them into illicit activity and it reinforces this dynamic where they continue to shun Iran.\xc2\xa0 So by structuring the sanctions the way we have, we think we can use their countermeasures to our advantage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how -- the Europeans tomorrow are going to announce something a little more -- that goes beyond the U.N. Can you talk about how this relates to that, whether we\xe2\x80\x99re going to adopt some of the measures they\xe2\x80\x99re doing?\xc2\xa0 And to what degree does this push Iran closer to China, which has been a straggler in terms of sanctions?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment exactly on what the Europeans might do tomorrow, but you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right that they\xe2\x80\x99re also considering measures that they can take to implement and build upon the resolution.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re actually partnering with them quite closely.\xc2\xa0 And it was part of the overall effort from the beginning that we would use this Security Council resolution -- which as you know, already sits on top of three prior sanctions resolutions, so we have now four sanctions resolutions against Iran -- and with other countries around the world, we will take measures that build upon the resolution, that are consistent with the resolution, and that draw upon those provisions of the resolution which are specifically intended to give countries the authority to do this.</p>\n<p>In terms of China, as is obvious, China, of course, not only is a U.N. Security Council permanent member but also voted for this resolution.\xc2\xa0 And there are significant obligations placed on China in this resolution, which we have every reason to believe that they will faithfully execute.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stuart, as you know, Congress is talking about its own unilateral sanctions package that would target countries that do business with Iran.\xc2\xa0 How are you guys doing on getting them to sort of compromise on that so that there would be a waiver for countries like China and Russia that help us, for instance?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are working closely with the Congress.\xc2\xa0 We share the same goal as the Congress does, which is to have an effective set of tools to bring pressure on Iran for its illicit activities.\xc2\xa0 We are in close consultation with them the try to have a bill that will be as effective as possible.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still a work in progress, but it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'re in very close consultations with the Hill on a regular basis.]</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you are pushing on a waiver?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re working with them on the bill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One more here and then we\'ll let Stuart go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were two countries at the U.N. Security Council that voted against the resolution.\xc2\xa0 My question is has your administration talked to the Turkish administration and Brazil, and how much cooperation so far you have received?\xc2\xa0 Has the Turkish administration stated that they are going to comply with the sanctions package?</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as not only Security Council members but also members of the United Nations, this is a binding resolution.\xc2\xa0 We have every reason to believe that both Turkey and Brazil will, in spite of their vote on the resolution, will comply with the resolution faithfully.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, now we\'ve got more participants today.\xc2\xa0 I\'m bringing Admiral Allen and Carol Browner in -- come on up, guys, you\'re the next contestant -- to help us go through -- obviously Admiral Allen -- if you have operational questions about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 Carol was involved in the meetings that were had today, so she and I can answer questions about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, Mr. Feller, take us away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Some questions about the fund, oil spill fund.\xc2\xa0 Was BP ordered to do this?\xc2\xa0 Did they do this on its own?\xc2\xa0 How exactly did that come together?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 We reached an agreement with BP that they will establish an independent claims facility and an escrow account.\xc2\xa0 And it was in the course of discussions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to do all of this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it your feeling that the company would have done this on its own?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, okay, this is essentially a White House-ordered agreement?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 It was a White House-driven agreement.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re now -- they will agree to set up this facility where claims can be expeditiously reviewed and decisions made about how to proceed.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll set up an escrow account of $20 billion.\xc2\xa0 They will also provide assets, U.S. assets of $20 billion to back that up.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the White House and other agencies of the government have been working over the past several days, and you heard the President speak last night, about -- and others in the administration speak yesterday -- about directing them to set up, as Carol said, an escrow account that would be independently administered for speedy claims.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is BP the only company paying in?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what about the other companies that were involved in some way that may have an interest in the well or the rig -- are they liable at all?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, BP is the responsible party.\xc2\xa0 There may be other responsible parties.\xc2\xa0 Obviously BP will be working to -- with those companies in whatever way is appropriate to secure funds.\xc2\xa0 But what we have is an agreement for $20 billion in this fund.\xc2\xa0 It is not a floor, it is not a ceiling, but what this gives us is the assurances so that we can make sure that the people, the small businesses that have been impacted can get their claims paid in a timely manner.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It sets up a process.\xc2\xa0 There will be Mr. Feinberg and then a three-person review panel.\xc2\xa0 All of that can be done in an expedited manner.\xc2\xa0 At which point the individuals\xe2\x80\x99 claims have been met, if the individual is not happy at that point, they retain all of their legal rights.\xc2\xa0 BP, however, can only seek an appeal of Mr. Feinberg\xe2\x80\x99s determination if the claim is in excess of $500,000 that\xe2\x80\x99s been granted, or if Feinberg certifies a appeal is allowable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why $20 billion?\xc2\xa0 Is that the figure that the White House thinks is enough to cover all the damage?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a floor or a ceiling, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why the figure?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Because what we wanted to make sure that there were adequate resources there for people to know that they could have their claims met.\xc2\xa0 There were also claims -- the states, local governments may have claims, and so we wanted to start this with a fund that would be adequate to meet all of those expectations.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And just to reiterate, this does not in any way limit or cap the economic damages that BP may be responsible for.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Or natural resource damages.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or natural resource damages.\xc2\xa0 So it is not a floor, not a cap.\xc2\xa0 It does not limit in any way their responsibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear from Mr. Hayward outside.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have anything specifically to say to him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President spent 20 or so minutes at the very beginning of these meetings -- for several hours our group was in discussing the details of the framework agreement, and the President spent 25 minutes with the chair alone in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And I think you heard the President speak directly about that.</p>\n<p>The comments that he made at the opening of the meeting and to the chair were not directed at any one person but directed at the entire company, and underscore the responsibilities that they have as the responsible party for this disaster.</p>\n<p>Do you have anything you want to -- yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you bring us behind the scenes a little bit for the meeting?\xc2\xa0 It was supposed to last a short time; it lasted several hours longer than it was on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how it played out and whether the apology that was made was something that you suggested that they do.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 They actually began the meeting with the President in the Roosevelt Room with an apology from the chairman.\xc2\xa0 It was not something we asked for.\xc2\xa0 The meeting then turned to the President laying out the concerns we had, the things that we thought were very, very important to be addressed. We talked about the containment that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 He talked about the fact that every time he goes down to the Gulf he visits with these individuals, he visits with small businesses who are feeling the impacts, the need to get that addressed.\xc2\xa0 And the best way to move forward would be through a independent process, not run by the government, not run by BP, and an escrow account to ensure adequate funds to meet the needs.</p>\n<p>And again, if they\'re not adequate, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a floor, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a ceiling.\xc2\xa0 There will be -- BP remains liable.\xc2\xa0 They remain liable for everything they were liable from the beginning -- which is they remain liable for the cleanup costs, and now what we have is this fund to honor the economic costs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was the dividend something that you pressed them on?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, the President has said publicly, going back almost two weeks ago now, that he understood they might have legal obligations, but he didn\'t want to be in a situation where the people of the Gulf of Mexico weren\xe2\x80\x99t getting their needs and their claims honored and dividends were moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And so they agreed today not to proceed with the final dividends of this year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what was the atmosphere of the meeting?\xc2\xa0 What did it go on longer?\xc2\xa0 What were the things -- there must have been sticking points that --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 There were sticking points.\xc2\xa0 We did have to take breaks at times.\xc2\xa0 And we had a number of people.\xc2\xa0 They had\xc2\xa0 -- there were six people I think representing BP, and we had in the room maybe six or seven.\xc2\xa0 And there were -- at times, we needed to -- each side wanted to just talk among themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We did take a break at one point to inform the President of the state of discussions and to seek his counsel.\xc2\xa0 And I guess from the outside it seems like it was a long time.\xc2\xa0 It was a pretty busy time, but there were breaks -- not for lunch or anything like that, but for conversation among each of the parties alone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow-up -- did the President accept the apology?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume so, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us more about the sticking points?\xc2\xa0 What exactly were those sticking points?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to get into what was agreed to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell us what it is that you sort of bumped heads over?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reached an agreement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a really important agreement for the people of the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 It gives the individuals and it gives the small businesses some certainty that their claims are going to be handled in an expedited manner.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is a very positive step forward in what has been a very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The $100 million fund for unemployed -- $100 million, right?\xc2\xa0 Was that suggested by the White House, or something that they volunteered?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No, that was suggested by the White House.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned, and we welcome the fact that they are making a voluntary contribution, $100 million, to a foundation for unemployed rig workers as a result of the changes in the situation in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>And you should also know, we are continuing to pursue some legislative fixes that would allow individuals to apply for unemployment insurance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make our way our rounds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you -- just one more thing on sort of the tone of this meeting.\xc2\xa0 As these various things were being brought up -- the $100 million, the $20 billion -- what was the sense?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what were they doing?\xc2\xa0 Were they pushing back?\xc2\xa0 Did they -- can you give us some color as to how they were reacting?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Negotiations are negotiations.\xc2\xa0 People have ideas; they put them forward; they discuss them; they decide how to proceed.\xc2\xa0 But we were very clear from the beginning -- the President was clear from the beginning that what we needed was some sort of independent claims process; we needed an escrow account.\xc2\xa0 And we stayed focused on achieving the President\xe2\x80\x99s goals for the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one final thing.\xc2\xa0 The $20 billion fund, when was that agreed to?\xc2\xa0 Was that yesterday and then just finalized today?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 It was agreed to today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, it took a long time for this meeting to come to fruition.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President obviously almost waited two months before he saw Mr. Hayward face to face.\xc2\xa0 Going forward, do you expect to have continued meetings at this level?\xc2\xa0 Or is this it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President will meet at -- meet with whomever he needs to meet with, whenever.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen is in touch with BP, others are in touch with BP, and we have been throughout this process and we will continue to be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this level, I mean do you expect this to happen again, or is it not --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, if more meetings are needed, more meetings will be had.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to what the President said yesterday -- this is probably more for Admiral Allen -- the President said yesterday that if something isn\xe2\x80\x99t working, we want to hear about it; if there are problems on the ground, we will fix them.\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that local authorities have the ability to communicate to the federal government when there are problems?\xc2\xa0 Because we have been reporting for a good deal on the Gulf and it seems like a lot of local officials feel like they are having to take steps on their own and kind of deal with the problems as they come up, as opposed to waiting for the federal government.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, there\xe2\x80\x99s a conduit into our incident commanders.\xc2\xa0 But what we did do after the visit down there -- and I talked to the President about this yesterday -- we established specific deputies for the incident command post in Mobile for Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.\xc2\xa0 We also guaranteed Governor Crist we\xe2\x80\x99d put an incident management team -- this is a group of Coast Guard folks -- into their emergency operations center in Tallahassee.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do the same thing in Mississippi, in Biloxi.\xc2\xa0 So to the extent that they think there is a problem or there is a problem, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to us, we got to reduce the cycle time, our ability to respond.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that by putting leadership closer to the states, and the ability to make decisions out there and put assets on target as soon as we can, and quicker.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on I think it was Dan\xe2\x80\x99s question, on the $100 million, you had been saying before that the oil rig workers that are put out of work would basically be treated equally to other people.\xc2\xa0 It now sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re being put into a different category with a limited amount of money.\xc2\xa0 Are they now not going to be treated as well as they would have if they could have applied just like everybody else for the $20 billion?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I think there were some concerns about, under the law, their ability to participate in the other fund, and we wanted to make sure that there were mechanisms to address their needs.\xc2\xa0 And so the $100 million voluntary contribution by BP and the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Congress we think is a significant step towards meeting their needs.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would say this.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President\xc2\xa0 -- he said this in the Gulf probably more than a week ago and reiterated in his speech last night that he understands the economic impact of the deepwater drilling moratorium, understanding that we do not yet know what caused the accident.\xc2\xa0 And because of that, the President believed it was important to pause additional deepwater drilling, but has asked the national commission that will look into the regulatory framework that we must have going forward to ensure drilling is safe, that they can and should look at the framework around deepwater drilling first and report back to him as soon as they can.\xc2\xa0 They do not have to wait for any set period of time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re now kind of in a second-class here, having to rely on this separate fund.\xc2\xa0 And you say going to Congress -- well, that\xe2\x80\x99s taxpayer money.\xc2\xa0 So instead of -- so it sounds like taxpayers are going to be paying for some portion of this.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s for the unemployment insurance portion of it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re asking Congress.\xc2\xa0 Some of the workers apparently would qualify under existing law; some might not.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to make sure that all of them clarify -- and now there is this additional fund that has been created.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other area, Feinberg.\xc2\xa0 I mean, knowing him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll get up and move in quickly.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s got to set standards. I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bureaucracy and setting up an operation here.\xc2\xa0 How quickly will he actually start handing money out to people?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand people can continue to file claims.\xc2\xa0 This will be a seamless transition.\xc2\xa0 As Feinberg\xe2\x80\x99s operation comes up, they will be shifted over.\xc2\xa0 But there is a claims process today.\xc2\xa0 We all realize it\xe2\x80\x99s not working the way we want it to work.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of why we reached this agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People down there are saying that what they\xe2\x80\x99re getting is a drop in the bucket compared to what they --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, that\'s why --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we set this up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we did this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when will they be getting the bucket rather than the drop in the bucket?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked Ken to set this up as quickly as he can and humanly possible.\xc2\xa0 I think picking him, in somebody who has done this before, understands, as you said, the bureaucracy and the standards that have to take place.\xc2\xa0 I do think it is important to reiterate what Carol said, which is that if you were to file a claim yesterday or today, you still fall within a 90-day window to have that claim adjudicated.\xc2\xa0 That will continue to be the case.\xc2\xa0 We believe that this will be handed off in a seamless way and that we now have additional backstops to ensure that claims are not just heard independently, but the appeals process beyond Ken Feinberg to a three-judge panel and ultimately retaining their right under federal law if they\xe2\x80\x99re unsatisfied with even what the three-judge panel rules, that they can visit federal court.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said that these are people with mortgage payments, boat payments, families to feed.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t get this money in a week or two, they could be looking at food stamps.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we are moving as expeditiously and as quickly as we humanly can.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And there are claims being honored.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are claims, and we can get you the numbers; they\xe2\x80\x99re reported on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Should get them from -- I think BP did a claims call yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you guys were on that.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And we have the numbers, Nick has the numbers. So we can get you the numbers -- the number of claims that have been responded to.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s important, people should go into that process, if they have a claim to date.\xc2\xa0 They will be moved over as this system is stood up.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to understand that under -- if the federal government adjudicates the claims, that we make a one-time payment.\xc2\xa0 Under this, people will be able to apply over and over again as is necessary.\xc2\xa0 So it won\xe2\x80\x99t be just a one-time payment.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So in other words, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a fisherman in Grand Isle, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to estimate -- because, quite frankly, I\'m not sure anybody knows how long the Gulf is going to be closed.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to extrapolate 12 or 24 months in advance and come up with the paperwork and what have you.\xc2\xa0 You can file a claim now.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re still not able to fish sufficiently --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Two months from now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- right, two months from now.\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s still restrictions on fishing in certain parts of the Gulf, you can refile until you\xe2\x80\x99re made whole.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a different process than if the -- as Carol said, if the federal government ran it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a one-time deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if I\'m a fisherman and my boat payment is due in two or three weeks, am I going to get it, or is that just out of the question that it would move that quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You will have your claim heard under the current process and seamlessly moved over to a new independent process that we think gives the certainty of the funding, as well as the independence of a third party.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 This is the overall summary.\xc2\xa0 We can give you a more detailed breakdown if you wish.\xc2\xa0 But as of this morning, there were over 66,000 claims filed.\xc2\xa0 Disbursed was over $81 million; they\xe2\x80\x99ve already passed the $75 million threshold --</p>\n<p>MR. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s paid.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 -- claims.\xc2\xa0 And checks cut, 26,000.\xc2\xa0 So those are the overall order of magnitude numbers.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you define a \xe2\x80\x9cdissatisfied claimant\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Is that people that received money and then in hindsight feel like, you know what, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fair thing?\xc2\xa0 Could you just define \xe2\x80\x9cdissatisfied claimants\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do how the current system works and how it will work.\xc2\xa0 Right now, if you file a claim under the current system and you are dissatisfied with that claim, you have the right to go to the federal trust fund, the oil spill liability trust fund, or to go to court.\xc2\xa0 What this sets up is you can file a claim; Mr. Feinberg will determine whether or not your claim should be paid, how much should be paid.\xc2\xa0 If you -- at that moment, you can take it.\xc2\xa0 And if two months later, you\xe2\x80\x99re still not working, you can come back and file another claim.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And BP is legally bound to pay that.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re legally bound to pay it.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like what Mr. Feinberg decides, you can go to a three-person panel and have that reviewed.\xc2\xa0 At the end of that panel, you could take that.\xc2\xa0 If you still don\xe2\x80\x99t like that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you take -- if you\'re dissatisfied and take the money?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re dissatisfied, what you do -- if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like what Feinberg does, you go to the three-person panel.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like what the three-person panel does, you then have a choice.\xc2\xa0 You can go to the federal trust fund, the oil spill liability trust fund, or you can go into court.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t take the money and be dissatisfied?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t take the money and be dissatisfied.<br/>\n\tBut the big thing here is that you will get a much more -- you will get a quicker answer, and you can file over and over again, because that was a real short --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can file a lawsuit if you choose to --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 If you choose --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not to take the money?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to understand, the 90-day process, the three-person review panel is within the 90-day process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have to within --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 They all have to be done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the 90 days?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did you guys agree -- can you share with us the details of -- what is the procedure to go back to BP and say, you know what, $20 billion isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough?\xc2\xa0 Is there a specific procedure you guys agreed upon when you go back and say -- if you need -- you say it\xe2\x80\x99s not a floor, not a ceiling -- that you go back and say, we need more money, is there a specific procedure you guys agreed upon?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 BP retains all of its liability.\xc2\xa0 Nothing in that has changed.\xc2\xa0 So if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t money available, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, you can go right back -- okay, you could go straight to BP and say, I have this claim.\xc2\xa0 So all of the rights of the claimants have been preserved, right?\xc2\xa0 Right now, this new escrow account, this new claims facility, will stand in its place.\xc2\xa0 But if for some reason there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t money in that, you have all of your rights to go right back at BP and ask for the payment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the -- okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 The only people who have limited their rights here is BP.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s really, really important to understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you accept the money you have limited some of your rights.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Right, but that was true under the existing situation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve given you a better scenario now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech when the President talked about energy legislation, he did not specifically talk about pricing carbon, cap and trade, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Is it -- what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- does he -- will he accept a bill out of the U.S. Senate that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have this if he likes -- I mean, can you just walk us through that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President for three and half years now talk about his approach to comprehensive energy reform.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s been unclear.\xc2\xa0 He reiterated a call last night and said that the greatest price we pay is the price of inaction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This morning the President spoke with Senator Kerry and with Senator Lugar, each of whom have energy legislation that the Senate is likely to take up in the next several weeks.\xc2\xa0 We announced that next Wednesday we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bipartisan group of senators to the White House to discuss the process that the Senate will use moving forward.\xc2\xa0 I think it is safe to say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction on energy is very similar to the direction that is in the Kerry-Lieberman bill, and that the President feels strongly that including a component to deal with climate is important in comprehensive energy reform.</p>\n<p>Now, let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of proposals. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Senator Lugar and Senator Kerry both got calls.\xc2\xa0 There have been ideas about increasing energy-efficiency standards in buildings much as Carol has worked tirelessly to do with cars, light trucks and heavy duty trucks for the very first time.</p>\n<p>We met with -- the President met with business executives at the White House last week, which -- one of their questions was why more money isn\xe2\x80\x99t spent on R&amp;D when they\'re spending a ton of money on R&amp;D.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of ways to get to this.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to have a meeting next week here to work through that process going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are comparisons to the public option fair, where this was something -- the President supported the public option, but he got 90 percent of what he wanted and he\xe2\x80\x99d rather sign 90 percent --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I don\'t know why at this point it would be pertinent to get into hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President -- go back to what he said at Pittsburgh a week and a half ago.\xc2\xa0 Go back to what he said in 2006 as a U.S. senator.\xc2\xa0 I think his position on how to approach our energy policy comprehensively is fairly well known.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, what is BP getting as a result of this agreement?\xc2\xa0 Are they getting any agreement that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be found negligent at all?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, Ms. Browner, you had said that I guess BP would I guess fund the fund with U.S. assets, so is it not cash? Or is it --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No, they will make payments over a four-year period of $5 billion a year.\xc2\xa0 But they will provide assurance for those commitments by setting aside $20 billion in U.S. assets.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like an insurance policy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not 20 and 20.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to $20 [billion], but we will have -- I want to use the right legal word here -- that they will provide assurance by setting aside assets.\xc2\xa0 So as the fund grows up, as the fund grows in size, the assets could be reduced.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an insurance policy.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what did -- what is BP getting out of this agreement?\xc2\xa0 I mean what --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would ask BP.\xc2\xa0 They may have -- I think they\xe2\x80\x99d have a better way of reading out what they did and why they did this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s objectives in this was -- objectives were clear.\xc2\xa0 This provides certainty and peace of mind for those in the Gulf if there was any wonder or concern that they would not be made whole for the disaster they didn\'t cause. That assurance we have today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think -- Carol mentioned this briefly -- the story that the President spoke of with the chair at the end of their meeting in the Oval Office was that when -- the President asked the chair when when they\'re talking about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Gulf, when they\'re talking and discussing these parameters with the board and with other executives, it\xe2\x80\x99s the people that he\xe2\x80\x99s met in his four trips -- the people in Grand Isle, the people in Pensacola, the people in --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 On Dauphin Island.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dauphin Island -- who for four generations have fished on these waters to make a living, who have invested their hard-earned money and their sweat in building their business -- those are the people that the President has been focused on throughout this process and believes -- he believes that that\'s what BP should be focused on as they\'re discussing these.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on that point, is there a danger President Obama is over-promising when he says, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make you whole and make the Gulf Coast even better than it was before?\xc2\xa0 I mean, people\xe2\x80\x99s lives have been changed and it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get worse a long time before it gets better.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, and the responsible party has committed today through an escrow account that starts at $20 billion to make them whole.\xc2\xa0 Mark, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a fisherman or you\xe2\x80\x99re a shrimper and your livelihood has been changed because you\xe2\x80\x99re in what would traditionally be the heart of the season where you made almost all of your income, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be compensated for that.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve set out a process that is -- that provides independence from the company that caused that disaster with the assurance that the funding will be there.\xc2\xa0 That\'s important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of Gulf Coast restoration, the President was concerned about the region environmentally long before this disaster.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- whether it was manmade or a natural disaster -- Katrina coming to mind -- that has seen the wetlands and the marsh erode and become degraded for many, many years, this President believes that we have an obligation to return that valuable ecosystem and environment to a place better than it was before this accident happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>BP, as Carol said, is liable for the environmental degradation through natural resource damage assessments.\xc2\xa0 Those will be assessed and that bill will be provided to BP.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the basis of that will help restore the environmental vitality of that region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are we right in assuming, based on what President Obama said today, that no ass-kicking was required at today\xe2\x80\x99s sessions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President was clear about what he thought BP was responsible for and obligated to do.\xc2\xa0 We came with that in mind and left, importantly, with an agreement that is substantive, providing the assurance, providing the independence, providing the funding that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure people in the Gulf went to bed last night wondering whether that was going to be possible.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep tonight knowing that there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place to do this quickly, efficiently, transparently, and independently.\xc2\xa0 And I think they will -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep better because of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an ass-kicking, was there a tense tone? Were there raised voices?\xc2\xa0 Was it confrontational?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 It was a business meeting.\xc2\xa0 It was a focused business meeting.\xc2\xa0 We came to get something done.\xc2\xa0 We were successful in doing what we thought was important for the people of the Gulf.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- BP said that the President was frustrated.\xc2\xa0 He clearly said at the stakeout that the President was frustrated.\xc2\xa0 Could you explain why, give us some color about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why he was frustrated?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, what perpetuated the frustration --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The last 58 days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did he express it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, how did he express it?\xc2\xa0 What about tensions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, the parts of the meeting that I were in were as Carol described them.\xc2\xa0 I think when the President sat down in the beginning of the meeting, it is fair to say he outlined his viewpoint and the stories that he\xe2\x80\x99d heard and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen over the past eight-plus weeks -- the livelihoods of generations interrupted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you heard the President say, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this story a couple of times -- we were talking about Dauphin Island in Alabama, a place that was just beginning to recover after Katrina.\xc2\xa0 This was to be the first season, post-Katrina, where they thought the economy was getting better.\xc2\xa0 They had rebuilt after watching a hurricane -- one of the reasons you take that ferry is because that island doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s two islands now.</p>\n<p>So this was to be the season for tourism or for fishing that this region was going to get back up on its feet.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President opened the meeting by discussing those stories.\xc2\xa0 And he ended his time with the chair discussing those stories again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody from BP would walk away from the last 58 days or the meeting here not knowing that the President, all of those involved in the response and the recovery, have been frustrated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\'m asking is, again, I\'m going to try to go back and get something out to make you understand what I\'m saying.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there clenched-teeth moments?\xc2\xa0 Were there moments when he struck the table with his fist to show his frustration, anger --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think his frustration was exhibited in the stories that he told, the stories that he\xe2\x80\x99s heard from the Gulf and the stories that he took back to speak with the executives in the company that are going to make the decisions that resulted today in the knowledge that the people of the Gulf will indeed be made whole.</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry, Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I want to go to BP\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition, if you could shed a little light on that.\xc2\xa0 Its bonds were trading at distressed levels today, indicating a mounting concern whether it can pay debts.\xc2\xa0 And some people were saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s about a 40 percent chance of default in the next five years, based on its credit -- can you take us behind -- and what was said by the company or the White House\xe2\x80\x99s own financial analysis that says the company will not default?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, we did not discuss with BP today their financial -- what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the market.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have had analysts look at this situation.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the company has strong assets.\xc2\xa0 They have a lot of assets that they can -- they will continue to operate, continue to be a viable company, and that they will be able to honor the claims associated with this dreadful disaster.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they have any -- make any suggestions about debts at all?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you removed the possibility of punitive damages from this equation?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Nothing was taken off the table with respect to enforcement of the laws, whether it be the Oil Pollution Act, the Clean Water Act, and that was made clear.\xc2\xa0 Nothing has been taken --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of government --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 In terms of punitive --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- seeking punitive damages.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Nothing has been taken off the table in terms of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen, as I understand it, even if everything works optimally, 10 percent of the oil will still be leaking into the water at the end of July.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with that pace?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we hope by the end of July we will have a new capping system and a new production system that will give us up to 80,000 production capability a day, and at that point, we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty well assured there should be a minimal leakage around that wellhead.</p>\n<p>Obviously the ultimate solution is to drill the relief well, which we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the first two weeks of August.\xc2\xa0 But based on the proposal we got from BP last week and our second letter to them, they have come in with counterproposals that have increased the production capacity there that should have us, by the end of next week, up to about 28,000 barrels a day, and then by the end of June, 53,000 barrels.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to shift from the containment cap we have now and put a harder cap on with a device that will allow us to produce more oil that will get up to 80,000.\xc2\xa0 But the plan is to get us to 80,000 by end July.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s 90 percent containment -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the same thing?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be shifting from a containment device to an actual cap that will require us at some point to literally unbolt the flange on which that lower marine riser pipe was on that was cut and replace it with a new flange or -- there\xe2\x80\x99s three different options they have to do that.\xc2\xa0 That will -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do that to be able to jump from 53,000 to 80,000 barrels a day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will still be substantial oil offshore.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At this time, are any foreign-flagged skimmers headed to this country -- not just the skimming equipment we put on our own boats?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We have foreign-flagged vessels that are operating out there, they\xe2\x80\x99re on the way.\xc2\xa0 We will not turn down any offer that\xe2\x80\x99s viable that we can use the equipment for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding offers of these things were made early on and were turned down.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We have an exhaustive list of when it was received and how we acted upon with that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re glad to make that public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are foreign-flagged skimmers on the way?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Foreign-flagged vessels are operating out there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between skimmers and skimming equipment.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are foreign-flagged --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be specific.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand, but I want -- you guys have been focused on this now for several days and I just want you to hear what Admiral Allen said.\xc2\xa0 There are foreign vessels operating as we all speak in the Gulf right now.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got to a condition yet where they would need a Jones Act waiver to operate because they\xe2\x80\x99re operating outside of state waters.\xc2\xa0 BP has also gone out and purchased from Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Norway -- wherever they can find a source of supply, they are seeking it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 David, did you have a follow?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, to follow on the containment issue.\xc2\xa0 Was there any reason that the President or anyone else in the meeting today had to pressure BP to do anything else on the containment front?\xc2\xa0 Or are you completely satisfied with the course of action that they laid out in the letter as they\xe2\x80\x99re proceeding?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was that not part of the --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we briefed over the last couple of weeks, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a very significant iterative process.\xc2\xa0 We said, give us a plan; we said, not enough capacity, not enough redundancy, not soon enough -- and they came back, they gave us another plan.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to some pretty extraordinary lengths to bring in these shuttle tankers that are not normally used in the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 These are vessels that are dynamically positioned so they don\xe2\x80\x99t move, hooked to a flexible hose to the production platform that would allow us to ramp up between 53,000 and 80,000 barrels a day.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve given them the stretch goals.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve come in and told us how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it.\xc2\xa0 We need to monitor that now.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And what we did -- we should point out -- we did at the beginning of the meeting, after the President left the room, we did spend some time going through these containment plans, making sure that every single thing was being done to expedite.\xc2\xa0 They walked through the different production schedules, where different parts are coming from, where vessels are coming from.\xc2\xa0 And as the Admiral say -- said, we have to obviously</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Plans making sure that every single thing was being done to expedite.\xc2\xa0 They walked through the different production schedules where different parts are coming from, where vessels are coming from.\xc2\xa0 And as the Admiral said, we have to obviously remain vigilant to ensure that all those -- they\xe2\x80\x99re actually -- in the case of getting t something on the order of 50,000 barrels per day by the end of this month, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually manufacturing a riser.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not one in the world that would work for this particular application because it\xe2\x80\x99s never been done before.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s actually in a foundry being made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the $100 million fund, does that effectively limit BP\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for any worker moratorium layoffs?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we said, there were significant questions about whether or not those individuals would be eligible for -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the word I want to use -- under the Oil Pollution Act.\xc2\xa0 And so what we wanted to do -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we had already asked Congress to look at changing the unemployment compensation for a disaster situation.\xc2\xa0 And now BP has made a commitment of $100 million to a foundation to address the needs of these workers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as far as the government is concerned, that settles the issue of BP\xe2\x80\x99s liability for workers who were laid off?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 The point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make is there\xe2\x80\x99s a very significant legal question about their liability.\xc2\xa0 And so this was a way for us to address the needs of these workers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is going to administer that, and how?\xc2\xa0 And will it include people who are not just rig workers explicitly but also people who are part of that deepwater who are going to be just as affected but aren\xe2\x80\x99t literally rig workers?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that today we reached a very extensive framework.\xc2\xa0 We covered an awful lot of issues.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there were some details to be further fleshed out with lawyers, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So, for example, you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked a question about foundation; that\xe2\x80\x99s a detail to be fleshed out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it just rig workers explicitly, or is it people who are part of that larger economy that are affected by the moratorium?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s focused on oil rig workers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 During the campaign, the President made a big point of saying he would let science guide his decisions.\xc2\xa0 But a majority of the scientists consulted by Interior said they never signed off on a blanket deepwater drilling moratorium and actually say that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad way to go.\xc2\xa0 So why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President following their recommendations on that?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 At the time of the accident, the President asked Ken Salazar at the Department of Interior to undertake a 30-day review.\xc2\xa0 They reached out, they talked to a lot of experts, they got a lot of input.\xc2\xa0 Some of the people who provided input did not -- let me say it this way -- then policy decisions were made based on those recommendations.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Salazar made a decision to recommend a moratorium; that was a policy decision.\xc2\xa0 But the experts were providing their expert advice, but not the policy decisions that were obviously under the purview of the Secretary of Interior.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I will say this again -- I know the President said this last night -- we do not know what happened.\xc2\xa0 Thirty-three additional wells were being drilled at deepwater depths.\xc2\xa0 As we now know, the largest environmental disaster in our country was taking place.\xc2\xa0 The President did not think it made sense to continue those drilling activities as we were dealing with this without knowing what was going on.</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again, the President has told Governor Jindal and others, you can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here and tell me we can\xe2\x80\x99t trust BP to do anything, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take their word for it on the four permits that they had drilling in deep water, even as we were dealing with BP\xe2\x80\x99s disaster in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 The President just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t willing to take that chance.</p>\n<p>We had a long discussion about it because we understood and he understood that this was not a decision that didn\xe2\x80\x99t come without some displacement.\xc2\xa0 But that was superseded by not knowing what had happened and what could potentially happen if this happened again.</p>\n<p>I daresay the resources that would be necessary to deal with this happening a second time in that region would be hard to describe in words, and the President believed it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a chance that he wanted to take.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there\xe2\x80\x99s a criminal investigation going on; Justice is looking at the actions of some of the parties here.\xc2\xa0 BP executives were in a meeting at the White House today talking to the President.\xc2\xa0 Might the administration look at any claims they made, representations they made, things they said, with a view towards whether these might -- with respect to their own liability in this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 There was no discussion about any -- at any time in the meeting there was no discussion of any activities related to the Department of</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p><br/>\n\t\xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 There was no discussion about any -- at any time in the meeting, there was no discussion of any activities related to the Department of Justice investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they didn\'t ask for immunity?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a transcript of the conversation?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No, there was no request for immunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, a quick follow-up.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Nor would one have been granted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, a quick follow-up, if we could get a flavor of the meeting and how it went in the sense of -- the amount of money, for example, the $20 billion that was set aside, did BP want to put less into that fund?\xc2\xa0 Did they want the payments stretched out over more than four years?\xc2\xa0 Did they want to put nothing -- did they not want to create a fund at all?\xc2\xa0 Did the President threaten to use his legal authority in the 1990 act to go to court if necessary?\xc2\xa0 I mean can you give us some sense of this?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 As we said, it was a very focused, businesslike discussion.\xc2\xa0 The President had said what he wanted to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 We then worked -- a group of us worked with a group from BP, including the chairman, Mr. Hayward and others to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 And like any time there\xe2\x80\x99s a negotiation or discussion, there are sticking points and they get worked through.</p>\n<p>And what we have now is the product of that discussion.\xc2\xa0 And it is an incredibly important and historic agreement that we have achieved for the people of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d say this, Peter, the reason the President had this meeting was to come out with an agreement like this.\xc2\xa0 That -- his goal has been to do what we have to do to take care of the people of the Gulf that have been hurt environmentally and economically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Today, we come out with the assurance through funding and through an independent process that that will take place.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s driven his actions this entire time.\xc2\xa0 This is a tangible and substantive achievement that goes a long way to a big part of the speech that he talked about last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe Carol said at the beginning of the meeting, though, this is something BP was not going to do on its own.\xc2\xa0 I mean the President had to push --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s -- I think that is a push that\'s been happening over the past many days.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Right, right.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them when they came to some conclusion in their mind, we have had -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had folks looking at this for many days beyond yesterday and today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I apologize, Robert, I have to ask a question for a colleague too on General Petreus today played down the idea of a December review of progress in Afghanistan, saying too much should not be made of that review, can you give us a sense of the December review?\xc2\xa0 Do you still believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a key point for evaluating progress in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the December review is important, but without having seen either the question or General Petreus\xe2\x80\x99 exact answer, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if that review isn\xe2\x80\x99t ongoing on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look through the exact transcript, but I think for some reason to believe that that review process would not exist until December might be what he was pushing back on.</p>\n<p>Obviously, those theater commanders provide the President with written weekly updates that are quite thick.\xc2\xa0 This is both Afghanistan and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 As you know there are monthly Situation Room meetings with the Cabinet -- relevant Cabinet members, the President and the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 And this review is ongoing in nature.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two things.\xc2\xa0 Van Jones* says of disperse-ments -- disperse-ments, not disappearance, what happens to the disperse-ments now?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the capturing of the oil -- the President talked --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure -- dispersants, which is the liquid?</p>\n<p>Q*\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Disperants</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or a disbursement which is the payment?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry dispersants --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On top of the oil -- he says, the dispersants push the oil -- it\xe2\x80\x99s all about optics -- they push the oil from the surface down to the bottom of the ocean where it kills shrimp -- the marine life and things of that nature, so you\xe2\x80\x99re talking a capturing 90 percent of the oil, but what happens to the dispersant -- the oil that has been pushed down with the dispersants?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, do you want to do this?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 The purpose of dispersants is to separate the oil into smaller particles so they biodegrade quicker.\xc2\xa0 Oil will ultimately biodegrade at some weight -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a metabolic rate for absorbing oil into the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s oceans.\xc2\xa0 The dispersants accelerate that somewhat.\xc2\xa0 And we are applying -- have applied dispersants on the surface and are applying them subsea at the source of the leak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have because the extensive amount of dispersants that have been applied have limited --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tAnd are applying them subsea at the source of the leak.\xc2\xa0 We have, because of the extensive amounts of dispersants that have been applied, have limited to very particular situations the dispersants that are used on the surface, just because of the unknown factors associated with how much we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to use so far.\xc2\xa0 The most effective application of dispersants is at the leak site down at the bottom where they could be most effective in dispersing the oil.\xc2\xa0 *.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So but -- okay, with that, that is a poison that pushes the oil down.\xc2\xa0 What happens to that that?\xc2\xa0 You are pushing it down -- what happens?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 The oil ultimately biodegrades.\xc2\xa0 It is suspended for a while and then it biodegrades.\xc2\xa0 All oil will ultimately weather and biodegrade.\xc2\xa0 Dispersants accelerate that.\xc2\xa0 And we know there is some toxicity with dispersants, but it is far less than the toxicity of the oil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long is it going to take the biodegrading to happen?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I would -- we can check with NOAA and give the exact --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 * I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you a way to think about this maybe.\xc2\xa0 If you have a oily pan and you go to wash it, you squirt some Dawn in, right?\xc2\xa0 And what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 *</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Dawn.\xc2\xa0 And what happens?\xc2\xa0 It starts to -- Dawn, right.\xc2\xa0 Okay, Joy, but actually Dawn is the preferred.\xc2\xa0 And it starts -- that\xe2\x80\x99s how they wash the animals, in Dawn.\xc2\xa0 They actually use Dawn for the animals.\xc2\xa0 And it starts -- you know, so in your kitchen sink, you have the oil starting to break up and you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that biodegrading process right in front of you.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay and also --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t do dishes so I can\xe2\x80\x99t *</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooh!\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I bet he\xe2\x80\x99s doing some dishes tonight.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I reached* your home, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes -- or my sink, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 On another subject, and not to make light of this, but there is a preconception already about big oil versus average America.\xc2\xa0 And when the chairman of the board was at stakeout, and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure you heard it -- did you all hear the stakeout?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We were in my office getting ready.\xc2\xa0 I think we -- I heard parts of it, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you hear at the end when he said -- talked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s frustration, and then he said, you know, the President is concerned about the small people, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the small people</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tYou hear at the end when he said talked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s frustration, and then he said the President is concerned about the small people, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the small people.\xc2\xa0 Those words kind of rang very strong on television.\xc2\xa0 Talk to me, do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s just the wrong terminology?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that there was an arrogance?\xc2\xa0 I mean, because I\xe2\x80\x99m listening -- you guys said, we\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who had to push this forward, we had to push the $20 million, we had to push this, and it was all on the White House side.\xc2\xa0 And what did they offer?\xc2\xa0 Were they worried about the average American who are --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Carol talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as I said before, in meeting with both the chair and meeting with the group of executives, as the President came in, it\xe2\x80\x99s the people of the Gulf that the President has had in mind throughout this process as those that he\xe2\x80\x99s fighting for.</p>\n<p>Again, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a mom-and-pop restaurant that he visited on this trip, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a shrimper, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a mayor who represents constituents that earn their living on the water or through tourism or something like that,\xc2\xa0 that\xe2\x80\x99s -- those are the people that the President has had in mind throughout this entire time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wrong terminology, maybe --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And let me say -- I mean, again, we began in the Roosevelt Room, we began with the President, the Cabinet, and the BP representatives.\xc2\xa0 And when the chairman of the company spoke, he did begin with an apology.\xc2\xa0 So I think Robert\xe2\x80\x99s point is exactly right.\xc2\xa0 When the President spoke, he spoke about the people he\xe2\x80\x99s met.\xc2\xa0 He spoke about his trips to Louisiana and across Alabama and Mississippi and Florida.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wrong terminology on behalf of BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would assume so, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said before that -- and I just want you to clarify -- with regard to Kerry-Lieberman, you seem to indicate that that would be sort of the basis from which the President would move forward.\xc2\xa0 Is he committed to having that be the starting point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what I said was I think that the principles enlisted in Kerry-Lieberman are consistent with the principles that the President has outlined on countless occasions dating back -- I would say dating back to the campaign but likely dating back to his service in the U.S. Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, one of those occasions was last night, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention it explicitly.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of folks on the Hill interpreted the ambiguity that he left in terms of the legislation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99d focus on what the President said and has said on any number of occasions --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Robert, with all due respect, they have to pass this thing on the Hill, and there is a sense that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With all due respect, I understand the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen how a bill becomes a law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I could play it for you.\xc2\xa0 No, but there is a sense that the President\xe2\x80\x99s omission of Kerry-Lieberman has given --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I can be more clear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the President can be more clear than to look at what he said in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is he committed to having Kerry-Lieberman be the basis for this deal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is committed to exactly what he said in Pittsburgh and what he\xe2\x80\x99s said on countless occasions and what I said here today, that climate should be -- that climate has to be a component of a comprehensive energy plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t* he mention carbon caps in the speech if he\xe2\x80\x99s committed --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to play \xe2\x80\x9cseek a word\xe2\x80\x9d with you.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- I understand you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to write a story.\xc2\xa0 Go back and look at -- and I could email it to you, it would crash your computer -- all the times the President has talked about a comprehensive strategy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First, last week there were reports that BP was considering suspending one of their dividend payments and that they wanted to get * a cooling of the rhetoric from the White House.\xc2\xa0 And it looks like now today you got three dividend payments suspended.\xc2\xa0 Was there any giveback* -- was there any talk at all about cooling the anti-BP rhetoric in the meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I know of, no.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my second question, both -- Jon Stewart last week and this week has been very critical of the President.\xc2\xa0 Keith Olbermann last night really badly trashed the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 Is the President or the White House concerned at all about losing two such influential allies in the media?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Ken*.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, this is non-BP --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- can I say this?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before; I\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate it -- if the President had decided to run for President based on what the pundits were saying in December of 2006 and January of 2007, he\xe2\x80\x99d be in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 No, no, hold on.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the pulse -- the hand on the pulse of America by those that live on cable TV.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually think that\xe2\x80\x99s where all of real America lives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Non-BP-related.\xc2\xa0 Right before this, Dan Pfeiffer put out a statement urging the passage of the DISCLOSE Act.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that some of the good-government groups have complained about is this deal that was cut for the NRA in terms of moving around disclosure requirements.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk specifically whether/why* the President objects to that deal and why that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tim*, I have been -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out here while that must have gone up.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to go look at what was put out and give a sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s in that agreement.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t4:14 P.M.
