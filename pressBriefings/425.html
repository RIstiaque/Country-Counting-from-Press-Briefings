EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the weather, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and make it up to you here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes lead us off.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got about 10, 15 minutes.\xc2\xa0 He can handle sort of the nitty-gritty on the foreign policy pieces, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll flesh everything else out.</p>\n<p>Ben.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Let me just begin by giving you an update on the President\xe2\x80\x99s morning.\xc2\xa0 He was briefed again by National Security Advisor Susan Rice.\xc2\xa0 He did a phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a fuller readout of that call, as it just recently completed.\xc2\xa0 They obviously were focused on the ongoing efforts to get a sustainable cease-fire in place with respect to Gaza.</p>\n<p>With that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking in terms of using U.S. troops to do some kind of rescue mission at Sinjar Mountain?\xc2\xa0 And even though that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be combat troops on the ground in a traditional sense, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that put Americans at risk in a similar way?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, first of all, we have a very specific objective with respect to the humanitarian situation, and that is to get food, water and emergency supplies to the population on this mountain, and also, as necessary, to take airstrikes against ISIL as they threaten the people on that mountain.\xc2\xa0 And to date, I believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in the range of seven airstrikes associated with that mission.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there needs to be a lasting solution that gets that population to a safe space where they can receive more permanent assistance.\xc2\xa0 So what the President has done is authorized the deployment of 130, roughly, U.S. military personnel who will assess the situation on Sinjar Mountain and in northern Iraq.\xc2\xa0 They then, again, will make recommendations about how to follow through on an effort to get the people off that mountain into a safe place.\xc2\xa0 And you heard Prime Minister Cameron indicate today they\xe2\x80\x99re cooperating with us in those efforts as well.</p>\n<p>Again, these 130 personnel are not going to be in a combat role in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re there on a temporary basis to make assessments about how to get the population off that mountain.\xc2\xa0 This would be a humanitarian effort to get them to a safe space. There are a range of ways for doing that.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t made decisions about how to carry out that mission because we want to get the readout from this assessment team first.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given that it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty urgent situation, how quickly do you expect the President to get recommendations from this team?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think relatively quickly here -- in a matter of days.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable to just have permanent airdrops to this population on the mountain.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have been able to escape.\xc2\xa0 But again, we want to get options in place and move them to a safer place.\xc2\xa0 There are a range of ways for doing that.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be cooperating with Kurdish forces who are also operating in the region, other international partners.\xc2\xa0 And our goal here is to work with the Iraqis and with international partners so that these people can get off that mountain to a safer place.\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that involves U.S. troops reentering a combat role in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 It involves, frankly, a very difficult logistical challenge of moving folks who are in danger on that mountain to a safer position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there would be some danger to U.S. personnel that would be involved in a mission like that.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, if at any time you have -- I mean, even now, as we speak, we have pilots flying over Iraq; that always carries with it danger.\xc2\xa0 So in any effort, there are always dangers involved.\xc2\xa0 I think the key point here is that the U.S. forces -- the role of U.S. forces is not one of reentering combat on the ground, it\xe2\x80\x99s how to provide humanitarian assistance to this affected population.\xc2\xa0 And again, in terms of the kinetic actions that are being taken, those are in the form of airstrikes.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Ben, if they come under fire, if that kind of mission is launched and they come under fire, they would be in combat, would they not?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as a bottom line, force protection is always a mission for U.S. personnel in any country in the world.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already reinforced our embassy in Baghdad and our facility in Erbil with military personnel who are there for the express purpose of protecting those facilities.\xc2\xa0 So any U.S. military personnel anywhere in the world has the ability to protect themselves, but the purpose and the mission that they are going to Iraq for is not to engage in combat.\xc2\xa0 This is to make an assessment on a temporary basis about how we move that population off the mountain and into a safe place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you make of some of the assessments you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from some of your Republican critics in the last couple days that ISIS does pose a national security threat to the United States?\xc2\xa0 Is that also the opinion of the President, the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President has ordered this military action in Iraq because of the threat that they pose to our facility and our people in Erbil.\xc2\xa0 So, by definition, we absolutely believe that ISIL poses a threat to U.S. persons and U.S. personnel.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on dealing with that threat right now in Iraq so that the terrorists cannot advance on Erbil.\xc2\xa0 The airstrikes that we have launched have stopped those advances and given space for the Kurdish forces, the Peshmerga, to engage ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But we are always monitoring not just the security of our facilities and our people in places like Baghdad and Erbil -- also monitoring potential plots against the United States, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is one of the options under consideration is creating a safe corridor for the refugees to get off that mountain?<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there are a range of options.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of decisions that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been made yet.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to rely on what the teams report back in terms of their assessment.\xc2\xa0 But you look at corridors, you look at airlifts, you look at different ways to move people who are in a very dangerous place on that mountain to a safer position.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what our team is doing on the ground now in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President willing -- I know he said over and over again no ground troops in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But is he willing to consider the option of sending a certain number of troops in there for the purposes of establishing something like a force protection, like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, or a safe corridor for them to get out?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t made that decision at this point, Jon.\xc2\xa0 We want to see what the circumstances are, see what options are available for moving those people who are trapped on the mountain.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have not just U.S. personnel who could potentially get engaged in that type of effort.\xc2\xa0 We have Kurdish forces who are engaged in the area with ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We have international partners who also want to support the provision of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at what the best way and the safest way is to get those people off that mountain.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be making decisions after he hears back from the military about what they found on the ground there in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- because the President has said over and over again no combat troops, no ground troops in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Does that statement extend to the idea of a safe corridor -- establishing a safe corridor?\xc2\xa0 Is he willing -- is that something -- so in other words, are you saying -- I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ruled out sending in additional troops to establish a safe corridor for those refugees to get off that mountain.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t received a recommendation to establish a corridor at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking what he\xe2\x80\x99s ruled out.\xc2\xa0 Because he\xe2\x80\x99s ruled out many time ground troops.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 What he\xe2\x80\x99s ruled out is reintroducing U.S. forces into combat, on the ground, in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But there are a variety of ways in which we can support the safe removal of those people from the mountain.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we already have people on the ground working with Kurdish forces in a joint operation center in Erbil.\xc2\xa0 So there are ways in which we can coordinate with Iraqi forces on the ground, for instance, in seeking to combat the threat from ISIL and to bring people to a safe space.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, as we make decisions about what the best course of action is to bring those people to safety, we will be very transparent about that.\xc2\xa0 I think the principle holds that we\xe2\x80\x99re not putting ground forces in a combat role in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re using U.S. military personnel to assess what the best way is to bring people to safety and what the best way is to provide them with humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 But again, always, force protection is a mission for U.S. personnel wherever they are in the world.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true of the reinforcements that are protecting our facilities in Erbil and Baghdad.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What information does the U.S. have about how many people still are stranded on the mountain and where exactly they are?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So there have been a broad range of estimates to date that go into the tens of thousands.\xc2\xa0 We believe that some number of thousands of people have been able to escape from the mountain, but not in a safe enough way and to a safe enough space that we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the remaining people who are trapped there can get off.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Part of what these teams can do, working with Kurdish forces, is try to get an understanding of the scope of the challenge on the mountain, as well as the routes to remove people.\xc2\xa0 To date, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also provided over 100,000 meals, some 27,000 gallons of water.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue those airdrops.\xc2\xa0 The British have done a number of airdrops, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had offers of assistance from France, Canada, Australia.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re getting aid to the people who are on the mountain while also trying to determine that best means to bring them to a safe place.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, Maliki is showing resistance to stepping down as Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. have any message for him specifically after this new Prime Minister-designate has been chosen?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think the message to all of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders is there is a peaceful process in place to get a new government for Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a new president.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a new speaker of parliament.\xc2\xa0 And a Shia alliance of different political blocs has put forward Dr. Abadi as a candidate for Prime Minister, and now the President has asked him to form a government.\xc2\xa0 So in our view, he is clearly the Prime Minister-designate in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 This process now needs to go forward for him to put together a government and submit it to parliament.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that is the process in place that all Iraqis have to respect.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, any efforts to derail that process, any efforts to use violence instead of working peacefully through the political process will be rejected not just by the United States, but by Iraqis themselves, by the international community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we want to see, again, a peaceful context for this process to conclude.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an enormous opportunity with a new Prime Minister-designate in place to get a unity government that all of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s different factions can buy into, can support, and then turn the focus to where it needs to be, which is combating the threat from ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think Maliki is trying to derail the process?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, to date, the process has moved forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s still there, though.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s still there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a 30-day period now that Dr. Abadi has been designated as the next Prime Minister for him to form his government and present it to parliament.\xc2\xa0 That is the step that needs to take place for this to be formalized.\xc2\xa0 So that is an ongoing process.</p>\n<p>But I think our message to Prime Minister Maliki and to all Iraqi leaders is this is the one process that is consistent with the Iraqi constitution that is going to lead to a new government, and he needs to respect that process, let it go forward.\xc2\xa0 Because frankly, this is not being imposed on anybody from outside of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 This is what the Iraqis themselves have decided to do, including, importantly, not just the Kurdish President and the Sunni Speaker, but the different Shia political factions that put forward Dr. Abadi as their candidate for Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the White House be glad to see Maliki off the world stage?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The White House will be very glad to see a new government in place with Prime Minister Abadi at the lead of that government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, frankly, to bring the country together.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the course of the last several years is you did not have Iraqis working together across different sectarian and communal lines.\xc2\xa0 You had a Sunni population that became disaffected.\xc2\xa0 That led to a loss of confidence in certain parts of Iraq in the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>What we need, and this is -- often we\xe2\x80\x99re asked, what is the long-term strategy for dealing with ISIL?\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear:\xc2\xa0 You get a new government in place.\xc2\xa0 That provides the basis for all of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s communities to support the government of Baghdad and to turn the focus where it needs to be, which is on combating ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We will be providing a training-and-equipping security assistance and advice to Iraqi and Kurdish forces, and then we can begin to squeeze the space where ISIL is operating and start to push them back.\xc2\xa0 But that demands the cooperation of all Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the opportunity we have with this new government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the allies have offered to help with humanitarian efforts.\xc2\xa0 Does that extend to getting the refugees off the mountain, either through a corridor or airlifts?\xc2\xa0 And also, do we need personnel up there to help distribute the aid that\xe2\x80\x99s being dropped?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So, in the first instance, Wendell, the Iraqis and the Kurdish forces in particular have been engaged.\xc2\xa0 They have a presence on the mountain, and they will certainly be cooperating with us in this effort.\xc2\xa0 The Brits have been the most forward-leaning of all of our allies in terms of doing humanitarian airdrops.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Cameron today indicated that they want to work with us as we work to get that population to a safe place.\xc2\xa0 So the United Kingdom has been fully in coordination with us in the provision of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we have offers of support from a number of allies like France, Australia, Canada.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be in discussions with them about what they can do, both as it relates to helping the Yezidi population that has been trapped on the mountain, but also more broadly, helping bring relief to the displaced persons in northern Iraq, which includes not just Yezidis, but an enormous number of Iraqi Christians and others who have been driven from their homes by ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And distributing food, is there no concern about the chaos that can be caused by just dropping supplies in there and letting the people sort it out?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, we have done several airdrops I think every night.\xc2\xa0 We have good fidelity on where the food and water is dropping.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re able to watch how that reaches the population, given the assets we have in the area.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re able to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to drop food and water in places where we believe people are concentrated.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done these types of humanitarian airdrops in other instances.\xc2\xa0 And so, again, we have an ability to focus on where we believe people are most impacted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But part of what these assessment teams will do who are going to northern Iraq is get a better understanding of the situation on the mountain where folks are.\xc2\xa0 And so that can help inform, again, both how we move them off the mountain, but also how we\xe2\x80\x99re providing that humanitarian assistance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s not being equitably distributed, then does that suggest a more -- a presence, an American presence on the mountain?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- when you talk about 100,000 meals, 27,000 gallons of water, that\xe2\x80\x99s not including the British support; there\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a lot of food and water, and other support that is reaching the mountain and the people on the mountain.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we would be the first to acknowledge that\xe2\x80\x99s not a permanent solution, just dropping food and water in perpetuity from the air.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re turning our focus to right now.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to appreciate the specificity of this question.\xc2\xa0 When the President asks military advisers for recommendations, he spells out his own limits.\xc2\xa0 Has the President told his military advisers, don\xe2\x80\x99t bring me a recommendation that includes U.S. military personnel on the ground as part of a corridor to remove the Yezidis or anyone else from Sinjar?\xc2\xa0 Is that off the table entirely as far as what the President is asking for as to actionable decisions he can make there?\xc2\xa0 Or has he told them, if there is a way that U.S. ground forces can expedite that, I am open to that and bring me your best thoughts on making that happen?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Major, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 First is, we have a range of ways that we can support this type of effort.\xc2\xa0 We bring very unique capabilities in terms of our logistical capacity, in terms of our intelligence capacity, in terms of how we can support and strengthen the Iraqi and Kurdish forces on the ground.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s one limiting factor that he\xe2\x80\x99s communicated repeatedly in public and to the military is we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be reintroducing U.S. forces into a combat role on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But if they can --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he defines it as a humanitarian mission, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a combat role.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is he\xe2\x80\x99s open to recommendations in which the United States is helping to facilitate the removal of these people from the mountain on a humanitarian mission, which we believe is separate than saying U.S. forces are going to be redeployed in Iraq in a combat role to take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The people who are on the ground fighting ISIL are the Kurdish forces and the Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are taking action from the air on the objectives of protecting our people and providing a humanitarian space for the Yezidis in particular on the mountain.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s additional things that we can do as part of an effort to move them off the mountain, he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly review those options.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you would acknowledge that defining it as a humanitarian mission doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s not dangerous and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t turn into a combat situation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Major, absolutely there are dangers involved with any military operation.\xc2\xa0 We would absolutely acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 There is danger when pilots are flying sorties.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a danger when you\xe2\x80\x99re in a very difficult situation, as we are in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s confident that we can have a limited military objective.\xc2\xa0 When people talk about whether or not the United States is going to be drawn more into another war in Iraq on the ground, I think what they need to know is we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out what the objectives are for our military, which are protecting our people and carrying out the humanitarian mission.</p>\n<p>The broader effort to take the fight to ISIL on the ground is being carried out by Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with our training, our arming, our advice.\xc2\xa0 But again, they\'re the ones who are engaged in combat, not just around the perimeter of Erbil, but around other parts of Iraq.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Ben.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have one quick announcement, and then we can get to your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>President Obama set a goal early in his first term to lay the foundation for the United States to lead the world with the highest proportion of college graduates by 2020.\xc2\xa0 Last January, the President asked college presidents to increase college opportunity for all Americans, because a college degree remains one of the surest ways to get into the middle class, and is an especially powerful engine of social and economic mobility.</p>\n<p>Today, we are pleased to announce two things.\xc2\xa0 First, 14 additional community colleges, as well as new private sector partnerships, are joining this effort.\xc2\xa0 They will join more than 100 colleges and 40 nonprofits across the country who have been working to advance college opportunity earlier this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Second, the President and the First Lady will host the White House\xe2\x80\x99s second College Opportunity Summit on December 4th of this year.\xc2\xa0 This year\xe2\x80\x99s summit will focus on building strong K-12 and higher education partnerships to encourage more students to go to college and to finish their degree, especially for first-generation, low-income and underrepresented students.</p>\n<p>These efforts have inspired engagement and supported the progress of educational leaders who are taking collective action in their schools on college campuses and in their communities to do all they can to help more low-income students prepare and succeed in college.</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Nedra.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can you give us the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s interview in The Atlantic this week?\xc2\xa0 And also his response to the phone call yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think we addressed this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The President, indeed, appreciated Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s call, as he does every opportunity to chat with the former Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 They have a close and resilient relationship.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that in 2007, as some of you covered, they had about 20 presidential debates.\xc2\xa0 And even after a hard-fought nomination contest, the President felt strongly he wanted her to be a key member of his team.</p>\n<p>That\'s why Secretary Clinton was the President\xe2\x80\x99s partner for four years in managing a wide array of complicated foreign policy situations.\xc2\xa0 They continue to agree on a broad majority of issues confronting our country, even if they have the occasional policy difference.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President appreciates her counsel and advice, but more importantly he appreciates her friendship.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to seeing her this evening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But was he upset that she was critical of him, especially at this time when he\xe2\x80\x99s juggling all these crises overseas?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go ahead and get into a behind-the-scenes here.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the President appreciated her call yesterday, as he does every opportunity to chat with Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s folks put out a short readout of that call, but we are looking onwards and upwards.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what is going to happen tonight -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be any media access for this hug that\xe2\x80\x99s greatly anticipated?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure most Americans watching who have a birthday party, they would all love you to join them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect open press access for this private social gathering of someone\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\xc2\xa0 I understand the press interest here, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and get you a sense of some sort of readout of what happens after the fact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that his only plan to see her, is at the party?\xc2\xa0 Do they have any other plans together?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.\xc2\xa0 That\'s it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was a good try.\xc2\xa0 But we all want to see if they do indeed hug here.\xc2\xa0 So don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that that would be something that -- you would like to have that seen -- American people?\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton, she said that she wants to hug it out, so why not let everybody see it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I believe the President and Secretary Clinton have had many hugs over the past few years.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I suspect many of them have been caught on camera.\xc2\xa0 Again, I appreciate the request, but I do think this is a private social gathering for someone\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to bring all of you lovely people in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about responding to the assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cdon\'t do stupid stuff\xe2\x80\x9d is not a policy?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure anyone in this room would contest that doing stupid stuff is a good idea.\xc2\xa0 But I also don\'t think anyone at the White House would assert that that is how we would describe our approach to foreign policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a description of how the President views the role of the United States in the world, I\xe2\x80\x99d urge you to look at his speech at West Point a few months ago, which again, I think many of you were at.</p>\n<p>So we do have sound, fundamental organizing principles that dictate how the President views the role of the United States in the world.\xc2\xa0 Number one, that is confronting any threat to the national security interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President has said he will not hesitate on that front.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d also urge you read a little bit further in that speech when he talks about how military action cannot be the only or even primary component of our leadership in every instance.\xc2\xa0 Just because we have the best hammer, doesn\'t mean that we have to hit every nail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I think that the President has taken a thoughtful, deliberate approach to these issues.\xc2\xa0 He laid out his general guidelines in that speech.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you there.\xc2\xa0 But our bottom line is the United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, and when our core interests demand it.</p>\n<p>And of course, most recently you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about our willingness to act on behalf of human dignity, and America\xe2\x80\x99s support for democracy and human rights goes beyond idealism.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of our charge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take the other part of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s critique, saying that the failure to fully support the moderate rebels in Syria fueled the rise of ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that critique?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this critique.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton actually wrote about it in her book, so we know that that was an honest policy difference that the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she wrote about the second part of it, fueling the rise of ISIS.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s new here is she is saying that this failure -- that\'s her word -- of the President to do this has fueled the rise of this terrorist group that we are now bombing in northern Iraq.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think the President has been very clear in a number of press conferences and in a number of interviews why he didn\'t want to rush to provide military assistance to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 As you may recall, he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about how it could have fallen into the hands of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we waited until we got to know the opposition better, had better working relationships, and worked to provide them non-lethal assistance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just because this has been a sore point in the past -- if we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be there, can you assure us there will be no other coverage, meaning the White House, of this event this evening, meaning nothing on Flickr or Twitter?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to rescind my invite?\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a sore point, Eric.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to treat it seriously.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Your point is well taken, and I can make that assurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondarily, remembering the hat you used to wear in a political context separate from the White House, how comfortable is the President with the idea that Republicans now running in the midterm elections can just as easily quote Hillary Clinton criticizing Obama foreign policy as criticizing it themselves?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right -- that is my old hat.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do a diagnostics of the midterms from here.\xc2\xa0 I will say the President has been very clear on the guiding principles that guide each of his foreign policy decisions.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton and the President have broad agreement on a wide range of issues.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why they worked so effectively for four years even when there are small policy differences.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a priority for the President; he had a fundraiser here just a couple of days ago to help the Democrats keep the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And in this context, Republicans don\'t even have to say, don\'t listen to me, just listen to the former Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that awkward for the President and all of his Democrats running for reelection?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to handicap potential Republican campaign ads from the podium today.\xc2\xa0 I will say, as you point out, keeping the Senate majority is a priority for the President.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he did attend the fundraiser two nights ago.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to doing what he can to maintain the majority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, what do you make of the criticism of the President being on vacation?\xc2\xa0 The Republican National Committee has put out a web video showing him playing golf, and that sort of thing, with all these foreign crises.\xc2\xa0 Has he had any second thoughts about whether this was a good idea to keep this vacation?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jim, as you know, the President is the President wherever he goes.\xc2\xa0 He travels with a wide array of communications equipment, and we also travel with a staff that allows us to have robust operational capabilities.\xc2\xa0 In this trip, that includes his National Security Advisor, Susan Rice; his Deputy National Security Advisor, Ben Rhodes; his Deputy Chief of Staff, Anita Breckenridge; and some very capable communications professionals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has it felt like a vacation?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President stay engaged.\xc2\xa0 On Saturday, he spoke with Prime Minister Cameron, Prime Minister *President Hollande.\xc2\xa0 He gave an update from the South Lawn and took your questions.\xc2\xa0 While up here, he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken with Prime Minister Erdogan, President Poroshenko, Prime Minister Harper and Prime Minister Renzi.\xc2\xa0 The President also had multiple national security briefings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think, as many have observed over the past few days, there\xe2\x80\x99s never a perfect time for the President to take some time away with his family.\xc2\xa0 But I think we can also all agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s valuable to recharge your batteries.\xc2\xa0 And I just don\'t think the American people begrudge their President for taking some downtime with his family.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one very quick follow.\xc2\xa0 Josh said last week that we might learn more about these in-person meetings that he might have.\xc2\xa0 Care to shed any light on what the President is going to be doing when he goes back and actually interrupts his vacation to go to Washington?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President is still planning on returning to Washington on Sunday for meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have too much more detail about that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more as the time comes.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the President will be meeting with Vice President Biden while he\xe2\x80\x99s back in Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Give us some indication, Eric -- will this formidable team the President has brought with him to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard return with him to Washington for that brief session with advisors?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Some.\xc2\xa0 Some of us will be returning; some of us will be staying in lovely Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who will be returning?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the manifests as soon as I can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask is that would indicate the level of seriousness of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on back in Washington.\xc2\xa0 Who stays and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t would give us some indication.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Eric Schultz is staying.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Michael.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a little bit about what the First Family has been doing in the last several days?\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t see what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing in the house.\xc2\xa0 Have they been reading?\xc2\xa0 Has the First Lady been exercising, working out?\xc2\xa0 On the beach?\xc2\xa0 Stuff that is happening while the President is on the golf course.\xc2\xa0 Talk a little bit about what their day is like.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to call this a working vacation, Mike -- I think probably an apt label for any presidential vacation.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, the President remains engaged -- getting briefs, speaking with foreign leaders, updating you all on ongoing situations.\xc2\xa0 But I also can say the President is very much enjoying some downtime with his family.</p>\n<p>As you know, they\xe2\x80\x99ve dined out at some of Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful establishments.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve also had a few meals in.\xc2\xa0 The President attended a fundraiser Monday evening to help keep the Democratic majority in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be attending a social gathering this evening.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed the President has already enjoyed a few rounds of golf, and I suspect you could see more of that to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s all stuff that we know.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about stuff that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s been going on at the house?\xc2\xa0 What books is the President reading?\xc2\xa0 What kind of activities is the First Family, Mrs. Obama and the kids, involved in?\xc2\xa0 Is Sasha here yet?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have private moments from the family\xe2\x80\x99s vacation to read out to you from the podium right now.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that Sasha arrives next week and Malia will be traveling back with the President on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, has the President worked on the issue of immigration in addition to working on foreign policy issues this week?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us an update on the timing for the executive action --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the update on that timing is that it remains the end of summer.\xc2\xa0 As you know, in June I believe, the President spoke in the Rose Garden asking his team -- specifically, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General -- to look at what he can do, given that House Republicans failed to bring up the comprehensive immigration bill, the bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He asked his team to take a look, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to report back in to him.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ve put that timeline as end of summer, and I think that still holds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has he been doing anything on that issue this week?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Nothing to read out from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe -- going back to the questions about Hillary Clinton -- just their relationship more generally?\xc2\xa0 Since she left the White House, we know they\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- or since she left the administration, rather, we know they\xe2\x80\x99ve had lunch at the White House (inaudible) and talked on the phone.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe that relationship more generally?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 They are very close friends, as I mentioned.\xc2\xa0 They came through a very heated primary contest in 2007.\xc2\xa0 After that contest, the President asked I guess then-Senator Clinton to be a part of his administration.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke about having a team of rivals be a member of his Cabinet, because he wanted strong, powerful voices who would offer candid advice.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I think they were such a strong partnership for the past four years in confronting the challenges across the world and advancing America\xe2\x80\x99s interests in each of those instances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Since leaving the White House, I know they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch regularly, as you point out, both in person and over the phone.\xc2\xa0 And, again, they look forward to chatting tonight.</p>\n<p>Kathleen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point, can you say whether the President has ever sought out Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s advice on foreign policy?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President ever sought out Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s advice on foreign policy?\xc2\xa0 You say that they talk, but does he value her opinion?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 He definitely values her opinion, and they definitely both talk.\xc2\xa0 When they see each other, they talk socially and they catch up on each other\xe2\x80\x99s personal lives.\xc2\xa0 But I am sure they talk about the pressing issues of the day, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The good folks at Bloomberg had a story out today about a number of the President\xe2\x80\x99s top donors being those who have profited from corporate inversions -- the same kind the President has condemned.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, just a very simple question:\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be asking Democrats to return money contributed, or seeking to return money contributed by some of these corporate inversion magnates?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these guys are profiting off of the very practice the President has condemned and wants to see stopped.<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jon, we are not privy to the details and have no role in any individual company\xe2\x80\x99s plans, but what the President is focused on is stopping the problem.\xc2\xa0 And stopping companies from renouncing their citizenship just to get out of paying their fair share of taxes is something that just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.\xc2\xa0 That is why the President called on Congress to do this.\xc2\xa0 That is also why we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted that the last time Congress closed this loophole was in 2004 with bipartisan majorities in the House and in the Senate, and signed into law by a Republican President.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to explore whether there are steps we can take with or without waiting for Congress to further encourage companies to build their businesses and create jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t this hypocritical?\xc2\xa0 I mean, essentially the President has profited himself -- his political apparatus has profited by taking contributions from people that have made money doing exactly this.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I guess I would understand the skepticism more if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing something to tackle the problem.\xc2\xa0 But instead, we are going after any company that renounces its U.S. citizenship in order to pay less in taxes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not renounce those donations?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re renouncing is the practice of using shifty accounting in order to avoid paying their fair share, and which subsequently passes on to middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask one other?\xc2\xa0 Ethel Kennedy laid down a direct challenge to the President of the United States, and she poured a big bucket of ice water over her head and asked the President to do same.\xc2\xa0 I assume he\xe2\x80\x99s doing this today.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I had a lot of thoughts on suggestions for who the President could designate to take this challenge, some of whom sit in this room.\xc2\xa0 However, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d release that the President is going to make a financial contribution instead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to -- I mean, Ethel Kennedy did it, and the President can\'t do it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As I said, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going -- the President has actually already made a financial contribution on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much was it?\xc2\xa0 How much was the contribution?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the amount for you.</p>\n<p>Katie.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, the President yesterday put out a statement on the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\xc2\xa0 And it looks like last night and early this morning, protesters were forced away by tear gas away in facing off the riot police.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the President has a response to these latest development and what his personal thoughts are on the death of Mr. Brown.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to any late-breaking developments overnight.\xc2\xa0 I will say that yesterday the President and First Lady sent their condolences to the family of Michael Brown.\xc2\xa0 Over the past few days, officials with the Department of Justice have begun monitoring the situation and working with local investigators on a full and thorough investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As the President said yesterday, he believes the best way to honor the memory of Michael is through calm and reflection throughout the community and the country, as details gather on what happened last Friday.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President and First Lady send their condolences to the family during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>I would add that the Department of Justice has dedicated resources to this, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with civil rights leaders both in the area and nationally.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you assure us that the President is not going to be dealing with the immigration issue when he goes back next week, in terms of a major announcement?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can assure you we are not anticipating a major announcement on immigration when the President is in Washington this weekend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- publicly he might confer with the Attorney General and the Homeland Security Secretary?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any of those -- can you ask that again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will that be the time that he confers with Holder and Johnson on the issue?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those meetings set up for you.\xc2\xa0 As soon as I have more details on those, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure we get them to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then I have a leftover question about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So many of the statements that the press office and the Pentagon have issued over the past few days about the mission have talked about coordinating with the government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 With so much political turmoil there, and such a power struggle going on, do you really know who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge?\xc2\xa0 Who is the White House coordinating with on this and other issues?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You said Iraq, not Ukraine?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I said Iraq.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that, as Ben expressed, we are very supportive of the steps the Iraqi government is taking to form their coalition government.\xc2\xa0 We believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken real, concrete -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen real, concrete progress over the past few weeks and months on this front.\xc2\xa0 And we have contacted all levels of the government in Iraq, both at the principal level --\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President read out a call yesterday, the President has made a few calls -- and also members of the national security team, as well as over at the State Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it comes down to the question of who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge, is it Nouri al-Maliki?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, our belief is the people of Iraq need to select their government.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen quite a bit of progress on that front over the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>Are we off to the Seafood Shanty?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, as a housekeeping matter, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be here when the President goes back to Washington, will briefings potentially occur here while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Washington?\xc2\xa0 Or will there potentially be briefings back at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate briefings at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other as clarification.\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned the importance of a Democratic Senate because we may have Supreme Court vacancies.\xc2\xa0 Was he saying -- was he giving some news there?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to have Supreme Court vacancies before he leaves office?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President was speaking generally about the opportunity to fill vacancies if they were to arise.\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t speaking about any specific vacancy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, one more on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to brief at the White House, are you going to brief here?\xc2\xa0 Is it likely or possible that Monday or Tuesday?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take requests.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, some of us are going to -- may have to go back with the President, and the idea is if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to brief here, it might not be smart for us to go back with the President.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let you all decide your own movements.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that we don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any major, significant news developments out of Washington those few days.\xc2\xa0 As for what\xe2\x80\x99s going on up here, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to be in touch.\xc2\xa0 We still have a few days before Sunday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, has Josh had his baby yet?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have no personnel announcements at this time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:42 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
