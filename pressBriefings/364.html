Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:08 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 TGIF.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just do a couple of quick things at the top.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The first is, you may have seen the news today that NASA successfully completed their test flight of the Orion spacecraft.\xc2\xa0 This is a new dawn, and -- while this is a dawn of a new chapter in space exploration, it certainly is an important milestone in achieving President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s bold vision of sending humans to an asteroid in the 2020s and on to Mars in the decade after.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Everybody here at the White House sends along our congratulations to the men and women of NASA and their commercial partners for the successful test launch, and we look forward to future milestones as we send our brave explorers out into the solar system.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>The second thing is a scheduling update.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will host here at the White House Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, for a meeting in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President and Dr. Biden will also host the Duke of Cambridge for a separate meeting at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The Duke of Cambridge, who is visiting New York with the Duchess from December 7th through the 9th, will travel to Washington on December 8th to deliver remarks at the World Bank, where he will discuss efforts to fight illegal wildlife trafficking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President welcomes the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s work in this global fight against what is both a national security threat and a devastating environmental problem.\xc2\xa0 In February, this past February, in support of the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive order and in conjunction with efforts at the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade, which the Duke of Cambridge attended, the administration announced its own National Strategy for Combatting Wildlife Trafficking.\xc2\xa0 That strategy mobilizes the entire U.S. government to combat this threat.</p>\n<p>This will be the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s first visit to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to thanking the Duke of Cambridge for the hospitality shown to him by the Royal Family during the President\xe2\x80\x99s recent visits to the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 This visit underscores the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q Will she be with him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that the Duchess is not planning to travel to Washington.</p>\n<p>With that, Nedra, try to follow that up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this news will compare -- the Defense Secretary, first of all.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some sense of what kind of conversations the President and his nominee had today?\xc2\xa0 Is he looking for a change in direction at the Defense Department to keep things the same?\xc2\xa0 Did they talk about Islamic State, Russia -- anything you can tell us?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe they had the opportunity to have an extensive, detailed discussion prior to today\xe2\x80\x99s event.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that, as the President alluded to in his remarks, the President has had a number of conversations with Mr. Carter in the context of his previous service of this administration in this country as the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President certainly intends to rely very closely on Mr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s advice and expertise on a range of areas.\xc2\xa0 His strategic thinking will be very valuable as we consider the range of threats that are facing this country.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to Mr. Carter receiving careful consideration by the United States Senate, but also swift confirmation in a bipartisan fashion.</p>\n<p>Q Is he looking for a change in direction at the Pentagon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit over the course of the last couple of weeks about the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision that new leadership was needed at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 But the challenges that Secretary Hagel has managed quite well are challenges that will endure and will continue to confront this country and the next Secretary of Defense as well.</p>\n<p>And so the President is looking forward to having somebody with Mr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s experience and evident talents to confront many of these challenges, and to lead this large department as they guarantee the protection of the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0On Ferguson, I saw that the President did an interview today with BET.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about why he wanted to do that, and also give us an update on the timeline for any sort of executive order that he may be putting out that he mentioned earlier this week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That interview has not been conducted yet; it will be conducted a little later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly is an opportunity to reach an audience that has been closely watching events in Ferguson, Missouri, as well as recent events up in New York City this week as well.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President to deliver a message that I think to many of you will sound pretty familiar.\xc2\xa0 But it is an opportunity to reach an audience that obviously has been following these developments very closely and has pretty strong feelings about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think there are a lot of Americans who feel strongly about some of these issues, but certainly we would anticipate that the viewers of 106 &amp; Park would have some strong feelings.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good opportunity for the President to make sure that they understand where he\xe2\x80\x99s coming from on some of these issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0And the executive action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on any timing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0And finally, Senator Landrieu -- the President planning to do anything with the election coming up this weekend in support of her?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any political activities that the President has planned for the weekend.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak on previous occasions about Senator Landrieu\xe2\x80\x99s important independent leadership for the people of Louisiana here in Washington and in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything that the President is planning in the next 24 hours in support of her campaign.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0What are we to take away from the fact that Secretary Hagel didn\xe2\x80\x99t attend this morning?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I saw that the Defense Department put out a statement indicating that Secretary Hagel decided not to attend today\xe2\x80\x99s event because he did not want to distract from an event that was held to honor Mr. Carter, his service to the country and the new opportunity that\xe2\x80\x99s before him.\xc2\xa0 And that was a decision that Secretary Hagel made, and certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that was respected by everybody here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Hagel put out a pretty clear statement showing his very strong support for Mr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.</p>\n<p>So for any additional questions about the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Was the President disappointed that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President certainly understands the sentiments that were included in the statement that was issued by the Department of Defense, and certainly appreciated the sentiments that were included in the statement from Secretary Hagel about Mr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0And did Hagel give the President some advance notice that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be coming?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we knew, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t view this as a snub of any kind?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Secretary Hagel intends it that way, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s evident from the statement that he issued in his own name today that he is very strongly supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to nominate Mr. Carter for this role.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Given that it was announced that Hagel would be attending ahead of time, clearly the White House wanted him to be there, no?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No doubt about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0And the change that happened late then, was that a surprise to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it as a surprise; I would characterize it as a decision that was made by Secretary Hagel.\xc2\xa0 But he was very clear in the statement that he issued today that he strongly supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to nominate Mr. Carter to succeed him at the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 He, like the President, believes that Mr. Carter has all of the qualifications and experience that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to confront the challenges that no one knows better than Secretary Hagel himself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0And he has described it as being a mutual decision, that there would be a change of leadership needed.\xc2\xa0 But it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really been explained so much why that change of leadership was necessary now, especially since he went on to say that he could have done the job and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem that he had.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is the result of a number of conversations between the President and the Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 And I want to protect the privacy of those conversations, and those were also conversations that were held with just the two men in the room.\xc2\xa0 So any sort of account that I could provide would be second or third-hand at best.</p>\n<p>I think, again -- Secretary Hagel is somebody who has honorably served this country in a variety of roles.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who was willing to serve his country overseas in combat, and it is the thing that distinguishes him from every other Secretary of Defense -- that he is a decorated combat veteran who arose from the ranks of somebody who was fighting on the front lines for this country to serving in the top job at the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 That is a testament to Secretary Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s talent.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to his love for this country.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to his commitment to serving the people of this country.\xc2\xa0 And that is service that the President was pleased to have the opportunity to pay tribute to here at the White House a week or two ago.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will have additional opportunities to pay tribute to Secretary Hagel and to his service to this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Okay, and given all of that and all that has been said about Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s service by the White House, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this strangeness of Hagel being announced at this meeting and then not showing up, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of highlight the tension that\xe2\x80\x99s been reported on so much, surrounding the position, and then continue to cloud it now that there\xe2\x80\x99s a new nominee?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that\xe2\x80\x99s clouded. \xc2\xa0I think that everybody has been straightforward about what exactly has happened, with the exception of a detailed readout of the private conversations between the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 I would acknowledge that we\xe2\x80\x99re not being particularly forthcoming about the details of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But the outcome of those conversations is something that has been discussed extensively by the President himself, by the Secretary of Defense, and certainly by me here on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think there is no doubt about Secretary Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the job that he has filled very ably over the last two years.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubting his commitment to serving this country.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubting his strong support for Ash Carter to be the next Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 And I think that certainly is indicative of what continues to be a strong personal relationship between the President of the United States and Secretary Hagel.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of openly transgender service in the military, I asked about this before and you talked about an ongoing review at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 What impact does the White House think this change of leadership at the Pentagon will have on those efforts?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that any ongoing reviews would face a dramatic change as a result of the new leadership in that building.\xc2\xa0 But for an update on that process, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>Q You keep talking about ongoing review, but when I ask the Pentagon about this, they say no review has been ordered.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s that discrepancy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t -- I would refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 We can try to get you some more details if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, I don\'t know a whole lot about this review.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s more information that you\xe2\x80\x99d like, we can look into it for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But does the President think that openly transgender service is a policy that can be implemented regardless of whomever is in charge of the Pentagon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding -- and maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll be corrected on this -- but I understand that there is a review ongoing at the Pentagon on this question.\xc2\xa0 But we can look into this a little bit for you -- a little further if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.</p>\n<p>Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Britain, from whom we inherited the grand jury system, dispensed with it many years ago because they found it ineffective and that it favored -- obviously favored the prosecutors so much.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to look at and have a review of our justice system and perhaps consider getting rid of the grand jury system?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me make a couple observations.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the grand jury proceedings that have attracted so much attention in the last 10 days or so, I don\'t think they received attention because the efforts of the prosecutor were significantly advantaged in the context of those proceedings.\xc2\xa0 I think the concern was -- evidently was something else, because ostensibly you had prosecutors who were making the case for an indictment that was not handed down by the grand jury.</p>\n<p>So I guess -- that goes to the premise of your question I think.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0If the prosecutor was really looking for an indictment.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, grand jury proceedings are conducted in private, so I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for us to tell.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of that -- in terms of what their goal was, I\xe2\x80\x99d direct you to those prosecutors for what kind of case they were making.</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99m frankly not inclined and pretty unqualified to have a philosophical discussion with you about the basis of our legal system and how that\'s been translated over centuries.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody at the Department of Justice that might be inclined to have that discussion with you, or not.\xc2\xa0 Who knows?\xc2\xa0 But you can certainly try.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 During his remarks today, Ashton Carter turned to the President and he pledged \xe2\x80\x9ccandid strategic advice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccandid military advice,\xe2\x80\x9d and a lot of people sort of noted that moment.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President felt was lacking before?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 And I think in my previous comments about Secretary Hagel, and I think even in the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments about Secretary Hagel 10 days ago or so in the State Dining Room, the President talked about how he had relied on Secretary Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s advice as they confronted a wide range of national security challenges.</p>\n<p>But certainly the President does expect -- not just from the Secretary of Defense but from every senior member of his national security team -- direct, candid, unvarnished advice based on that individual\xe2\x80\x99s insight and expertise to the challenge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Did he believe he was getting that under Secretary Hagel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I mentioned, I think the President was pretty clear that he -- and I certainly have been -- that the President appreciated the kind of candor and advice that he received from Secretary Hagel during his two years of serving as Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q And some lawmakers and Republicans have noted this is his forth Defense Secretary in six years.\xc2\xa0 They have argued that creates a sense of unsteadiness.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to that?\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that changing Defense Secretaries so frequently in some ways destabilizes the agency?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any evidence to support that claim at all.\xc2\xa0 And the President is very pleased with the service and leadership and advice that he\xe2\x80\x99s received from each of the gentlemen who has served this country as Secretary of Defense during the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration.\xc2\xa0 And we anticipate that Mr. Carter will continue in the footsteps of those who have come before him in terms of offering the President the kind of insight and strategic advice that he relies on and certainly expects from his Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0And while we\'re on the topic of the military, Senator Gillibrand is planning to reintroduce a bill that would take military sexual assault out of the chain of command.\xc2\xa0 Last time this bill was up for a vote, President Obama didn\'t really weigh in on whether or not he supported it.\xc2\xa0 At this point in the cycle, would he support it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we would want to take a look carefully at the legislation that she decides to propose.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But does he support the broader idea of taking military sexual assault out of the chain of command?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what he supports is making sure that there is keen awareness at the Department of Defense that the Commander-in-Chief will not tolerate the kind of -- the scourge of sexual assaults that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the media over the last few years.</p>\n<p>And the President said it himself that even one sexual assault in the greatest fighting force in the world is something that the Commander-in-Chief will not tolerate.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made that very clear to the civilian and military leadership at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 And we did recently see that the Department of Defense conducted what is at least a lengthy review of the way that sexual assault cases are handled inside the military.\xc2\xa0 And that is a review that is being carefully analyzed here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Just on something left over from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I saw the transcript was updated to say the President, in fact, did see the Eric Garner video, that takedown by police.\xc2\xa0 What was his reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the chance to speak to him directly about it.\xc2\xa0 We were able to do this electronically.\xc2\xa0 So I still haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- while I am able to confirm for you that he has seen the video, I have not spoken to him about his reaction to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Do you know anything about his reaction to the non-indictment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you heard from him a couple of times to discuss this, and I think -- I wouldn\'t elaborate too much on what he has already said about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Because after Ferguson, he forcefully came out here and he said this was the grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make.\xc2\xa0 Would that apply to this case as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly as a legal matter, and, again, as somebody who is not particularly credentialed when it comes to legal matters, but as a legal matter, it clearly is the decision that was handed down by the grand jury that is consistent with the legal process.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true of the legal process is that that is now subject to an investigation by federal attorneys, both in the Eastern District of New York as well as the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But I guess what I mean is, was he -- I mean, so many people were just shocked that this case ended up without an indictment, with that video seemingly so obvious to anybody who saw it.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have a similar kind of shock?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to second-guess -- but was he just surprised?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have not had a specific conversation with him in terms of his reaction to the video or to the immediate decision beyond what he said in public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0And just two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 One, King Abdullah made a comment in an interview before the meeting that the effort against ISIS is World War III.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering what the President thinks of that characterization.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I\'d say about that, Jon, is that we obviously have -- the United States has played the leading role in building a broad international coalition to confront, degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL because of the threat that it poses certainly to a number of countries in the region and the threat that it could pose to the world if it were allowed to establish a safe haven in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So to the extent that you have the world united, alongside the United States, in standing up against these extremists you certainly have a global element here.\xc2\xa0 And it is a threat that the President takes very seriously.\xc2\xa0 It obviously is a threat that our close partners in Jordan take very seriously because this is happening right in their neighborhood, and so they are -- the King has devoted significant resources and energy to ensuring that the humanitarian needs of those who are fleeing this violence have been met.\xc2\xa0 Many have fled to Jordan, and that has posed a significant challenge to that country.\xc2\xa0 And the United States -- and this was one of the announcements that was out of the meeting today -- is committing additional resources to help the Jordanians respond to this urgent humanitarian situation.</p>\n<p>And again, I think it\'s indicative of the role that the United States can play in supporting our partners as they deal with this very difficult situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Okay, then just one last item, following up on the Mitch McConnell meeting. \xc2\xa0Obviously this was an afternoon meeting, early afternoon meeting.\xc2\xa0 There was no bourbon served.\xc2\xa0 So just to follow up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement after the election that he would look forward to having a bourbon with Mitch McConnell, is that going to happen?\xc2\xa0 Or is this --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that will happen at some point, and we\'ll try to give you a heads-up when it actually does.</p>\n<p>Lynn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Josh, this is about the governors meeting today.\xc2\xa0 I know that the White House has said that they want to try and develop some particularly economic partnerships.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me a sense of what you -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be anything specific in mind when the governors are talked to?\xc2\xa0 And just a flavor -- it seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s like a little bit of school for new governors today, given all the officials who they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go see.\xc2\xa0 Can you give a flavor of what you hope might be -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s any concrete things out there?\xc2\xa0 And also, how were the governors selected?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the first impression that we would like to leave is that this White House and this administration more broadly has a strong interest in trying to work with governors across the country to expand economic opportunity for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something the President has laid out as the top item on his domestic policymaking agenda.\xc2\xa0 He certainly has tried to work with Congress to make progress against that goal.</p>\n<p>We have seen that there is an opportunity for us to make significant progress by actually working directly with governors.\xc2\xa0 And so this is a group of newly elected governors, and we certainly want to build the same kind of strong working relationship with them as well.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of areas where we feel like progress can be made.\xc2\xa0 There are many governors in both parties that have been committed to making important investments in high-quality early childhood education programs.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President mentioned in his State of the Union address almost two years ago now.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are going to look for opportunities to partner with governors across the country to make those kinds of investments.</p>\n<p>We obviously have been gratified over the last year and a half or so\xc2\xa0to see a number of states take action to raise their minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 This, again, is something that the President has urged Congress to do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen congressional Republicans block efforts to raise the minimum wage, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen states -- including states that are governed by Republicans -- actually take action to raise the minimum wage and give their workers a raise there.\xc2\xa0 The President is supportive of those efforts.</p>\n<p>There also are a lot of equities as it relates to the Affordable Care Act, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for at least some of these states to provide health insurance to -- by expanding Medicaid -- to a large number of citizens in their state.\xc2\xa0 And this is health insurance that would be, at least for this year, paid 100 percent by the federal government.\xc2\xa0 So at no cost to the governors or the citizens of these states, the federal government for this year would be in a position to provide important health care benefits for them.</p>\n<p>I mean, the thing that these governors know all too well -- or if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they soon will -- is that when individuals who would qualify for expanded Medicare present themselves at the hospital in dire need of medical attention, that medical attention is provided and it\xe2\x80\x99s the state that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately on the hook for providing that medical assistance in the most -- or I guess in the least cost-effective fashion possible.\xc2\xa0 So there is an opportunity for us to lower costs for states and for the President to get -- or for the federal government to get involved in helping states as they try to meet the needs of working people in their states.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot to talk about, a lot on the agenda, and there will be an opportunity for not just the President to sit down with the governors, but I know that there are other senior White House officials that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with as well as Secretaries Duncan, Foxx, Burwell, Administrator McCarthy, and others who will be visiting with them while they\xe2\x80\x99re at the White House today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Right, but is there something -- you talked in broad terms.\xc2\xa0 If you can think of something specific, if there is an ask or the governors -- is there something -- because each of these states do have different stages in their Medicaid programs.\xc2\xa0 So could you tell me how these governors were selected and why they were invited?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that all of the newly elected governors were invited to the White House, and these were the ones who were able to attend today.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Josh, I know it was early this morning, but did the President watch any of the Orion launch?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he had the opportunity to see it.\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken to him as yet today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0This is the first time in over 40 years that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s satellite or any satellite on the planet has left low Earth orbit.\xc2\xa0 I mean, NASA scientists say that this is the biggest thing since the Apollo program.\xc2\xa0 Is this something the President is excited about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I described as the dawn of a new chapter of space exploration.\xc2\xa0 And I think that does reflect the enthusiasm and excitement that everybody here at the White House feels.\xc2\xa0 And although I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to talk to the President about it today, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he shares that enthusiasm and excitement for this significant achievement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Because the President wants to focus on STEM achievement for students; he talks about that a lot when he goes out for campus events all around the country.\xc2\xa0 Is there a better ambassador or a better entr\xc3\xa9e to students\xe2\x80\x99 ambition in the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest space program?\xc2\xa0 It just seems like we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- could there be more attention from the White House on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly welcome all of the attention that is shown to this achievement.\xc2\xa0 The President himself has talked in pretty personal terms about how he was inspired as a kid from some of the innovations that were -- and achievements of the space program when he was a kid.\xc2\xa0 I know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk before about having watched it on television as the astronauts were recovered from the capsules that had returned to Earth and splashdowns in the ocean.\xc2\xa0 And we saw something reminiscent of that today when Orion returned to Earth in a splashdown.</p>\n<p>So this is something that we are pretty excited and enthused about, and it is a testament to the successful strategy that the President has put in place for our space program.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to even more exciting results in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Josh, on the budget, if the Senate is correct in saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s eager to embrace the House deal on a longer-term omnibus and shorter-term funding for DHS, is the President prepared to sign that if that comes to him that way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple things, Alexis.\xc2\xa0 We are still waiting to see the details that are included in the budget proposal that is supported by House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 There had been a number of conversations between White House officials and administration officials with members and staff on Capitol Hill in both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But we do continue -- the second thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that we do continue to believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of Congress to pass a full-year budget for the full federal government, and that is what Congress is responsible for doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there are a lot of Americans who on this cold and cloudy Friday got out of bed early and went to work because it was their responsibility to do so.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly would expect -- and I think, more importantly, they expect their representatives in Congress to do the same thing.\xc2\xa0 And what we are expecting Congress to do is to get out of bed early this morning, soldier through the cold and the gray, and take action to pass a full-year budget for the full federal government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0If they all lumber out of bed and don\xe2\x80\x99t honor your preference, is the President going to veto whatever they produce?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be in any way indicating that the President is going to block.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did not come prepared today to issue a new veto threat, but I did come prepared today to make clear that our strong preference is for Congress to do only what they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do, and that is to pass a full-year budget for the full federal government.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider what kinds of proposals are passed through the House and the Senate, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll reserve judgment on them.\xc2\xa0 But it is clear what basic responsibility Congress has, and we hope they will take action to fulfill it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0One other budget question.\xc2\xa0 To follow on Lynn\xe2\x80\x99s question about the governors -- as we all know, there are a range of governors, 17 at least, who are concerned about the President\xe2\x80\x99s immigration action in the context of their own budgets.\xc2\xa0 So will the President be able to outline to those governors who are concerned about the budgetary impact of his executive action why he feels strongly that this will all work out, or that the federal government is very sensitive to this?\xc2\xa0 Or how will he respond to questions that he may get about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any significant or negative budgetary impact on states as a result of the executive action that the President announced a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>I know that one of the key reforms that was included in these executive actions was an extensive overhaul, and I think even a replacement of the Secure Communities program.\xc2\xa0 This was part of an effort to try to strengthen the working relationship between local law enforcement communities and the federal government, and that it would actually remove some red tape and make it easier for local law enforcement and the federal government to coordinate their efforts to protect communities large and small all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of how the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive action will actually make it easier for the federal government and local law enforcement, I guess both at the state and local level, to protect communities all across the country.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Josh, can you give us the specifics on the Jordan increase in aid?\xc2\xa0 Is this new money?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that needs to be in the CR?\xc2\xa0 What are the details?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details in a factsheet that\xe2\x80\x99s out a little later today.\xc2\xa0 But what the President did announce was a commitment both in terms of resources to help Jordan manage the humanitarian situation in their country.\xc2\xa0 I believe there also was an announcement related to additional economic assistance that would be provided to our partners in Jordan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, the King has been a pretty strong advocate of some economic and political reforms in his country.\xc2\xa0 He deserves a lot of credit for that.\xc2\xa0 And the United States wants to be supportive of those ongoing reform efforts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one way that we can be supportive of those efforts.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But do you know if it\xe2\x80\x99s new money that has to be dealt with in the CR?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the funding details on this, but we can get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q Related to the comparison that King Abdullah made to World War III, he said this is a generational issue.\xc2\xa0 The President earlier this week talked about tectonic plates shifting in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 And the larger conversation seems to be between these two leaders that this is not just about degrading and destroying ISIS, but about something that is many decades in duration, or a kind of -- King Abdullah said this transformation in the Middle East about jihad itself.\xc2\xa0 Do you want to elaborate or offer the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I could try.\xc2\xa0 I probably won\xe2\x80\x99t do it as eloquently as he would, but a couple of things come to mind.\xc2\xa0 The reason that there are 60 countries that have joined this coalition that the President is leading is that countries throughout the region and across the world understand the significant stakes of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody who is attempting to downplay them.</p>\n<p>The second is, we have seen -- even before sort of this more recent rise of ISIL -- that the broader Middle East is working through some very tumultuous issues.\xc2\xa0 And the impact on their society and on governments across the region have been significant.\xc2\xa0 And these are the kinds of issues that the people who live in this region of the world won\xe2\x80\x99t resolve overnight; that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time for them to make some decisions about how -- about what kind of government they want to have in their country; about how they want to exercise their preferences about that government; about what kind of economic opportunity is going to be available to them; about how basic human rights are going to be protected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that has prompted a lot of questions and a lot of soul-searching, not just among leaders in that broader region, but also among people on the street.\xc2\xa0 And those kinds of conversations and considerations about what kind of country or what kind of society they want to be a part of are important.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes they can be, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, tumultuous.\xc2\xa0 But what the President has tried to do is to be very keenly focused on understanding that even in these roiling waters, that we need to be focused squarely on the core national security interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And in these dynamic, rapidly changing times, that can require some nimbleness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that is evident in some of the policymaking you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the President.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is part of the kind of flexible strategy that the President has pursued.\xc2\xa0 I think it also is why we have worked so hard to make sure that we are working closely with partners in the region to align our interests with them and with other countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why building this broader international coalition to confront, degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL was so important.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that so many of the members of that coalition are, in fact, Arab countries.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen countries like Jordan join the United States in bombing ISIL targets in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, reflects the kind of commitment that the President has to working closely with leaders in the region to align our interests and to get other countries to act with us in pursuit of those interests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Related to that, even those most favorably inclined toward Ashton Carter would say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have now and never has had any expertise on some of these underlying issues in the region, militarily or diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 Why was it a good idea -- why is it a good idea to continue that sort of vacuum within the civilian Pentagon leadership for the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what Mr. Carter does have is a lot of experience in thinking strategically about how to orient the Department of Defense in a way that ensures it is properly positioned to protect the core national security interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that he has spent a lot of time thinking about.</p>\n<p>We are going to continue to have a very experienced and very effective Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously very useful intelligence channels that ensure a strong relationship between the United States and some of our partners in the region and around the world.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that the -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it this way:\xc2\xa0 The President does have complete confidence in Mr. Carter\xe2\x80\x99s ability to fulfill the responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense, to build a strong military-to-military relationship with our partners and allies around the globe as well.</p>\n<p>He is somebody who knows the building inside and out, and he is somebody who has a very keen understanding of, like I said, how to orient the posture of the Department of Defense to best protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe he is the right person for the job, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been gratified by the early signals of bipartisan support that he has already received.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Josh, along those lines, though, somebody like Senator McCain -- who will be overseeing the confirmation hearings -- is saying nice things about Ash Carter\xe2\x80\x99s credentials but claiming that previous Defense Secretaries haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to crack the President\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle; that defense policy is really run here inside the White House and the Defense Secretaries have been railroaded.\xc2\xa0 How do you answer that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I answer that by saying that the President is proud of the leadership and advice that he has received from the men who have served as Secretary of Defense under this presidency.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to rely on the advice and counsel and expertise of Mr. Carter in the same way that he relied on the advice and counsel and expertise of Secretaries Gates, Panetta and Hagel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But based on their books, it didn\'t seem like Secretary Gates and Secretary Panetta thought that advice really was listened to very often.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you look carefully at their books, I think all of them had very strong things to say and very complimentary things to say about this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and the confidence they had in this President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to exercise the authority of the Commander-in-Chief to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I think to a person, Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta and Secretary Hagel would echo that sentiment.</p>\n<p>Q Did Ash Carter get any assurances from the President about his personal access, one-on-one, to the President, to the Commander-in-Chief?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Ed, that Secretary Carter -- or Mr. Carter -- he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been confirmed yet, but hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll be confirmed soon -- is somebody who will be afforded the privilege that previous Defense Secretaries have had, which is a weekly meeting with the President of the United States in the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0And that is extensive access.</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that when those Secretaries of State -- or those Secretaries of Defense have needed to communicate with the President outside of that weekly meeting, the President has been very responsive to their communications.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0A couple other on the Mideast.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you got some questions, obviously, about the American journalist who is being held by terrorists in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And on one of them you were asked -- one of those questions, you were asked whether there were delays.\xc2\xa0 And since -- at the time -- I understand yesterday you said some of this is still classified.\xc2\xa0 Since then, there have been more reports laying out more information suggesting there were some delays here.\xc2\xa0 Was it a hesitation inside the White House to move forward and try to get him?\xc2\xa0 Or were there problems, gaps in the intelligence that justifies waiting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are still some significant limits on what I can say about what is still a classified operation.\xc2\xa0 But what I would reject in the strongest possible terms is that there was any delay here at the White House in approving this mission.\xc2\xa0 Once the intelligence and the concept of operations had been developed by military planners and approved by the Secretary of Defense, it was forwarded to the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And while at the White House, it did go through an interagency process that was as rigorous as you would expect it would be.\xc2\xa0 There was careful consideration about the risk that this operation would put -- would pose for our men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0 There was careful consideration of the intelligence.\xc2\xa0 There was careful consideration of the kind of diplomatic equities that are involved.\xc2\xa0 There are important questions that are raised when an operation like this is taking place in a foreign country.\xc2\xa0 There are important diplomatic questions that are raised when there\xe2\x80\x99s the potential that some of the -- those who may be rescued are of a different nationality, are citizens of another country.\xc2\xa0 There are important equities raised when it comes to either killing or even capturing extremists.\xc2\xa0 And so thinking through all of those things is something that was -- that is important, that\'s consistent with the way that the process worked in previous administrations.</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that only involves White House personnel.\xc2\xa0 It involves, as I mentioned, defense, intelligence, diplomatic channels and others.\xc2\xa0 So there was careful interagency consideration that was given to this plan after it was signed off on by the Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that it was something that was approved by the Commander-in-Chief after that review in much less than 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Last one, staying in the Mideast.\xc2\xa0 There are reports that the administration is considering sanctioning Israel over the settlements issue.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could say true or false.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been informed of some of these reports.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about any sort of internal deliberations inside the administration, and certainly not inside the White House.\xc2\xa0 But I will say something that I have said many times before, which is that Israel is a close and strategic partner of the United States of America, and I don\'t need to remind you of the strong and unshakable bonds that exist between the United States and Israel, and the United States\xe2\x80\x99 exceedingly strong commitment to the security of the nation of Israel.</p>\n<p>That said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been crystal clear about our view of settlement activity.\xc2\xa0 That view has not changed.\xc2\xa0 We believe that settlements are illegitimate, and we have deep concerns about highly contentious planning and construction activities that the Israeli government is pursuing in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\xc2\xa0 We believe that those kinds of activities are counterproductive.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made those views clear in public and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made those views clear in private.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0So very clearly you\'re not denying that sanctions are on the table against even an ally?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m very clearly not denying that we have strong concerns about settlement activity that\'s underway in Israel.\xc2\xa0 But it has not and will not affect the United States\xe2\x80\x99 strong commitment to the national security of the nation of Israel.</p>\n<p>Q Then how can you be telling Congress don\'t issue more sanctions against Iran at the same time that you\'re considering sanctions against an ally in Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on any of those reports about our discussions as it relates to Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But you are considering sanctions.\xc2\xa0 You\'re leaving that door wide open here.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to talk about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- you\'re not considering sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to talk about those kinds of conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0It certainly sounded like you were considering.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But what I am saying is that we have been clear about what our strategy is against Iran.\xc2\xa0 And there is a historically tough sanctions regime in place against Iran.\xc2\xa0 And those sanctions that were put in place by Congress and implemented by this administration have been effective both in terms of exacting a heavy toll on the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen their economic output been significantly negatively affected by this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a significant decline in the value of their currency.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of ways to measure the impact of this sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>And we do believe that while productive talks continue, that it would be unwise to put in place additional sanctions on Iran only because the success of that sanctions regime depends upon the ability and willingness of our partners around the globe to enforce that sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we know, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot of business that\'s conducted between the United States and Iran directly.\xc2\xa0 We\'re relying on other countries that actually do more business with Iran to abide by this sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 So far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten that kind of international buy-in that has really cracked down on the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 It has prompted the Iranian leadership to come to the negotiating table with the United States and our P5-plus-1 partners to try to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about what our strategy is as it relates to Iran.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m less willing to talk about any internal conversations about Israel.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Cheerier news for you probably.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m for it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0The jobs report today said that there --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d never ask.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0were 321,000 thousand jobs.\xc2\xa0 It comes as a series of economic data that shows a strengthening economy; investors certainly seem to like it.\xc2\xa0 The Dow is heading toward 18,000 today.\xc2\xa0 Yet Americans remain deeply dissatisfied with the economy.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that\xe2\x80\x99s partly because the administration has failed to sell this to Americans?\xc2\xa0 Is this partly the administration\xe2\x80\x99s fault that Americans feel unhappy with the economy at this point?\xc2\xa0 Or how does the administration analyze that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that today\xe2\x80\x99s job report will have some impact on the public perception of the economy, as it should; that there are a lot of numbers included in this report to indicate that our economy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just made a lot of progress in recovering from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression but that progress is actually starting to accelerate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true whether you measure the number of jobs that were created, or even in this instance that the strength included in the wage growth number is encouraging and cause for optimism not just for people here in this building but also for working people all across the country.</p>\n<p>A couple of interesting statistics.\xc2\xa0 The first is we\xe2\x80\x99ve now had 10 consecutive months of more than 200,000 jobs created.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the longest streak that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in 20 years, and I think that is a testament to how sustained this economic strength is.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that I think is notable about this is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually experienced more job growth in the last 11 months than we have in any year since 1999.\xc2\xa0 So, again, the strength that we\xe2\x80\x99re exhibiting here is significant and particularly as it relates to the kinds of economic projections that have been in place over the last few years.</p>\n<p>As it relates to sort of the public appraisal of the economy, I think you heard from the President directly in the Roosevelt Room just a couple of hours ago that there is more work that needs to be done to make sure that middle-class families are benefiting from our strengthening recovery.\xc2\xa0 There are, as you pointed out, some metrics to indicate that they are benefiting from it as much; that there are -- corporate profits are at an all-time high; the stock market continues to improve.\xc2\xa0 We certainly welcome those signs of strength.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that working folks are experiencing those kinds of benefits, too.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be -- as I mentioned in response to an earlier question -- the focal point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic policymaking agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Just very tangentially related -- the administration\xe2\x80\x99s request on the omnibus, does that include more money for the IMF?\xc2\xa0 Last time, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\xc2\xa0 Are you pushing for it this time as part of this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the United States -- well, that the Obama administration continues to be strongly supportive of Congress acting on proposed IMF reforms that would significantly expand the financial contribution that the United States is able to make to the IMF and to development efforts without a significant increase in the kind of budgetary -- without a significant increase in the budgetary impact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0So you are pressing for some more now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We continue to be strongly supportive of the idea that Congress should act on these reforms to the IMF that -- again, these are reforms that the United States originally proposed.\xc2\xa0 We have seen countries around the world adopt them, and failing to adopt them has had an impact on the kind of influence that we exercise in that multilateral body.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0But you aren\xe2\x80\x99t pressing for --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly would like for Congress to take action on those IMF reforms.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Josh, President Obama went out to dinner last night but the pool was not told who he was having dinner with.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?\xc2\xa0 And will you tell us who he was eating with?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a full list.\xc2\xa0 I know that there were some members of his staff and some friends who happened to be in town.\xc2\xa0 And it was not a working dinner, this was a social dinner.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Can you get the list for us?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- if there are a couple names we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Transparency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re a leading advocate.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Who from the staff, Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll look and see if we can get you some names.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Because that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s business.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the point is that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing business there.\xc2\xa0 It was a purely social occasion.</p>\n<p>Steven.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s widely expected that the Senate Intelligence Committee will unveil its report on enhanced interrogation techniques sometime early next week.\xc2\xa0 In advance of its release, has the President been given a copy of the report?\xc2\xa0 Has he been briefed on the report?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The President has long advocated the declassified release of this report.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly welcome the news from the committee that they\xe2\x80\x99re planning to do so next week.</p>\n<p>The White House has been working closely with the committee and with the intelligence community to resolve some of the differences that have cropped up in the process of declassifying that report.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly aware of the contents of that report.\xc2\xa0 He obviously was able to be briefed on the classified version.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to believe, as he has articulated himself many times, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for our country to be transparent, as least as transparent as possible when we\'re talking about classified programs, about what occurred.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the news that the committee is preparing to release this report soon.</p>\n<p>Q One other question.\xc2\xa0 Then forgive me, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure anyone else is going to get a chance to ask you before Monday, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the level of expectation in this building ahead of the visit of Prince William on Monday?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of enthusiasm for the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s visit, as well.\xc2\xa0 We certainly are looking forward to hosting him here in Washington and at the White House for the first time.</p>\n<p>And the President has had the opportunity to visit with Prince William on a couple of other occasions.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned -- or at least I alluded to in my opening statement that the President and First Lady had the opportunity to visit with the Duke and Duchess when they were -- when the President and First Lady were in London for a state visit.</p>\n<p>The President also had an opportunity this summer at the 70th anniversary of D-Day to visit briefly with Prince William there, as well.\xc2\xa0 So the President has had an opportunity to meet him a couple of times.\xc2\xa0 The President has enjoyed those previous conversations and is really looking forward to Monday\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, as well.</p>\n<p>John, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the IMF reforms, and it would seem that talking to members of Congress, this has been sitting in Congress for four years now, I believe, and the President and Managing Director Lagarde have repeatedly called for action on it.\xc2\xa0 Yet the attitude, particularly on the Republican side, seems completely the opposite.\xc2\xa0 Not only do they criticize the reforms, but they talk about rescinding the extra $100 billion that Congress voted above what it regularly gives to the fund.\xc2\xa0 That was in \xe2\x80\x9909.\xc2\xa0 And a couple of years ago this measure got a hundred co-sponsors in the House.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Duncan of Tennessee has talked about reintroducing it.\xc2\xa0 What are you feelings about the attitudes of members which seem to be going in the opposite direction on the IMF?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the White House and the administration and the President have all been very clear about how important these IMF reforms are.\xc2\xa0 Many of the people that you described who are opposed to IMF reforms are exactly the same people who are suggesting we should do more to support the people of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the IMF has played a very important role in offering economic assistance to the people of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And more assistance could be provided if the IMF had access to greater resources.\xc2\xa0 The IMF would have access to greater resources if Congress would follow through on passing these IMF reforms.\xc2\xa0 So I think this is a pretty open and shut case, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Congress will -- that Congressional Republicans, I should say, will do the right thing here and act on those IMF reforms.</p>\n<p>So let me do a week ahead before we go.</p>\n<p>On Monday, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already mentioned what I think will be the highlight of an eventful week, which is the visit of Prince William here to the White House.\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon on Monday, the President will tape an interview for the Colbert Report with Steven Colbert at George Washington University.\xc2\xa0 Set your DVRs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Tuesday --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Airing that night?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Airing that night?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe so, yes.\xc2\xa0 He had a great -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you guys saw it, he had a great clip -- you guys are going to get mad at me, but he had a great clip in promoting the President\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the show on Monday.\xc2\xa0 He said that he was traveling to Washington and he was hoping to book his favorite 1990s alternative band, The Presidents of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 They said that there had been a mix-up and that he\xe2\x80\x99d booked the actual President of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 So it was very clever.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to that as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Why would they get mad at you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would they get mad at you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 They -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>Q (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0Gibbs apparently had ruled this out -- your predecessor had said the Daily Show not the Colbert Report.\xc2\xa0 Why the change of heart?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ah, change you can believe in I guess, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will deliver remarks at an event for the Senior Executive Service at the Washington Hilton.\xc2\xa0 The Senior Executive Service is comprised of the senior leadership of the federal workforce.\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon -- on Tuesday afternoon, the President will travel to Nashville, Tennessee -- this is something I mentioned yesterday -- to deliver remarks in his recent actions to fix as much of our broken immigration system as he can, while urging Congress to pass a comprehensive bill to get the job done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will host the White House Summit on Early Education.\xc2\xa0 This summit will convene prominent business leaders, philanthropist, advocates, elected officials and members of the public, committed to the expansion of high quality early childhood education opportunities for children across the country from birth through school entry.\xc2\xa0 At the event, the President will announce new efforts to enhance and expand the reach of high quality public preschool programs in high-need communities.\xc2\xa0 The President will also highlight new actions by the private philanthropic and public sectors to invest in and expand access to high quality early learning opportunities in communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will also participate and deliver remarks.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday afternoon, the President and First Lady will visit Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling where they will deliver toys and gifts donated by the Executive Office of the President\xe2\x80\x99s staff, to the Marine Corps Toys for Tots campaign.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President will join a meeting of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Export Council.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s Export Council advises the President on policies and programs that affect U.S. trade performance and promote export expansion.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously something that the President spent a lot of time talking about on his recent trip to Asia, and the meeting of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Export Council will be a useful opportunity to follow up on some of those conversations.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you all.\xc2\xa0 Have an excellent weekend.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END</p>\n<p>2:04 P.M.
