EDT</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to many places.\xc2\xa0 Before we take your questions I just wanted to let you know that this morning before leaving the White House, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security John Brennan, Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Mastromonaco, and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate updated the President with the latest details on the ongoing response to Sandy, including efforts to restore power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Throughout the day, the President will stay in regular touch with Administrator Fugate and the rest of his team to ensure that bureaucracy and red tape are not impeding efforts to respond to communities recovering from the storm.\xc2\xa0 The President will also convene conference calls today with local elected officials from affected areas to ensure that available federal resources are being provided in support of local response efforts.\xc2\xa0 We will provide readouts of those calls after they are conducted.</p>\n<p>At the direction of the President, the federal government continues to lean forward to support state and local partners as they recover from this storm.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, as you know, the President provided major disaster declarations for the states of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.\xc2\xa0 These declarations build on the emergency declarations provided earlier this week for these three states and many others leading up to the storm.\xc2\xa0 These specific three declarations make additional federal support available to states as they respond.</p>\n<p>These declarations also make federal assistance available directly to affected individuals, including temporary housing assistance, low-cost loans, and other resources to help cover uninsured losses.\xc2\xa0 As of 7:00 a.m. this morning, more than 36,000 disaster survivors from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have applied for federal disaster assistance, and more than $3.4 million in direct assistance to these individuals has already been approved.\xc2\xa0 These are resources, as I said, like housing assistance and to support immediate needs.</p>\n<p>We continue to urge, as we did yesterday, affected individuals in eligible counties to apply for assistance by visiting <a href="http://www.disasterassistance.gov">www.disasterassistance.gov</a>, or calling 1-800-621-FEMA.\xc2\xa0 That\'s 1-800-621-3362.</p>\n<p>Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano is scheduled to travel to Connecticut and New York to meet with state and local officials and view ongoing response and recovery efforts to Hurricane and Storm Sandy.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is involved in unwatering activities in support of state and local efforts, including in New York City.\xc2\xa0 The Corps has also deployed the 249th Engineering Battalion and other temporary emergency power assets to provide support to areas impacted by the storm.</p>\n<p>Coming out of the President\xe2\x80\x99s call with utility companies Tuesday night, FEMA has established a power restoration working group, which you know about, which includes representatives for the utilities at the National Response Coordination Center to cut through the red tape, increase federal, state, and local and private coordination, and restore power to people as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Led by FEMA, this working group includes representatives from private-sector utilities and includes government reps from the Departments of Transportation and Energy, as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and representatives from local law enforcement, among others.</p>\n<p>At the request of state and local officials, FEMA has deployed approximately 50 industrial generators to the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to provide support in areas where power has been lost.\xc2\xa0 Those generators are the kind that can put hospitals back online, and other facilities that are critically in need of power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are currently nine federal Urban Search and Rescue Teams deployed to impacted states that have helped support hundreds of rescues.\xc2\xa0 Currently, over 2,300 FEMA personnel are deployed to affected states up and down the East Coast, and that includes 14 Incident Management Assistant Teams, as well as FEMA liaisons embedded in state emergency operation centers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the National Guard has more than 11,000 forces activated to support governors of affected states.\xc2\xa0 Other federal agencies continue to provide resources -- provide support, including medical equipment and other resources.\xc2\xa0 Also, as an example, today more than 60 power restoration vehicles and crews from private utility companies on the West Coast are being air-lifted, using DOD assets from California, to the East Coast to support power restoration efforts in New York and New Jersey.</p>\n<p>With that, I turn it over to my colleague.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Two quick things.\xc2\xa0 One, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw, but just to highlight for everybody -- we have a new ad on the air today featuring the powerful endorsement by General Colin Powell. It\xe2\x80\x99s running in 10 states.\xc2\xa0 If you need a list, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Second, because we\xe2\x80\x99re on our way today to three states -- four if you count where we\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping -- I just wanted to highlight where we are in those states and give you a couple of new additional facts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Wisconsin, our first stop -- in Wisconsin voters in Democratic counties and precincts are turning out at higher rates and outvoting Republican counties and precincts by a margin of more than two to one; 161,787 -- to be exact -- ballots have been returned from wards won by Barack Obama in 2008; 78,876 from Republican wards.\xc2\xa0 And 87 percent of new registered voters are women, youth, minorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Second, we are headed to Nevada as you know.\xc2\xa0 Take off your sweaters.\xc2\xa0 Nearly half of Nevada voters\xe2\x80\x99 votes have already been cast.\xc2\xa0 And the President has an eight-point lead among these voters, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll.\xc2\xa0 This means Romney needs to win the remaining voters\xe2\x80\x99 votes by 54 percent just in order to tie up the race.\xc2\xa0 Democrats have an early-vote lead of 40,000 over Republicans, and the Democrats have the largest registration advantage ever of 15 percent compared to 2008.</p>\n<p>Finally, we\xe2\x80\x99ll end our day before flying to Ohio in Colorado.\xc2\xa0 Nearly half of Colorado votes have already been cast, and the President leads by 10 points among those who have already voted, according to recent polling.\xc2\xa0 Now, remember, Colorado is a state where 78 percent of the vote was cast by mail or early vote in 2008, so to give you an indication of how important that base is.</p>\n<p>Democrats are doing better in early voting this year than we were two years ago when we swept the U.S. Senate and governors race.\xc2\xa0 Turnout is up 25 percent among African Americans and 34 percent among Latinos compared with four years ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, can you talk at all about what we should expect from the President\xe2\x80\x99s tone today, coming off three days where he was really immersed in the storm effort?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to basically be game on in terms of criticizing Romney, or is he going to try to temper his tone a bit?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things I\xe2\x80\x99ll say.\xc2\xa0 The first is that obviously the President has been focused the last few days on exactly what the American people elected him to do, which is to serve as Commander-in-Chief and manage the country in a state of crisis.\xc2\xa0 This week, that\xe2\x80\x99s been the hurricane, Hurricane Sandy.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there\xe2\x80\x99s another reality happening, which is the election that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in five days.\xc2\xa0 And as Jay mentioned, he will be receiving updates throughout the day, receiving briefings on calls, constantly monitoring, and he\xe2\x80\x99s already put a robust recovery process in place.\xc2\xa0 But he will be out there today, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, Monday making the case to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you may have seen overnight, and I forwarded to all you, he\xe2\x80\x99ll also be laying out his closing argument to the America people today in his remarks.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that he has always planned to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been in the works for weeks.\xc2\xa0 And in his remarks today, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be -- these are the last five days of his last campaign -- ever.\xc2\xa0 So you will hear many of the themes -- much about the fight that he\xe2\x80\x99s been waging throughout his public -- career in public life on behalf of the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think people who have been covering him a while -- and I know most of you have not been covering him back to his state Senate days, but back to 2008 -- will hear a lot of the same themes, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot of the same message to the middle class, same message to the American people, about the choice they\'re facing.</p>\n<p>Now, part of that is laying out the choice between him and his opponent.\xc2\xa0 And what he\xe2\x80\x99ll say in his remarks today is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between real change -- real change that he\xe2\x80\x99s brought about, real change that he\xe2\x80\x99s not done delivering on -- and the change Mitt Romney is promising, which is going back to the same policies that led us into this mess and calling it change.\xc2\xa0 So to that degree, he will laying out the choice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important did the Jeep have -- the Jeep ads in Ohio How have you seen that impacting voters in Ohio and other Midwestern states?\xc2\xa0 Is it moving the needle at all with swing voters, or is it more mobilizing the base?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, I mean, just to reiterate, these Jeep ads that the Romney team have been running are a Hail Mary pass by the Romney team.\xc2\xa0 There are two major issues with it:\xc2\xa0 One is the facts.\xc2\xa0 You have the CEOs of GM and Chrysler making a very rare step to come out and say these ads are false.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the second, which I would argue is more important, is this raises a character issue.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney is closing the campaign in Ohio with an ad of fear -- scare tactics to scare the workers in the state about -- with false statements about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen at the Jeep plant, when we all know, and the plant has made clear, what the facts are.</p>\n<p>With that, the race in Ohio has been very stable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a four to five point race in most polls for weeks now, and we think that\'s because, one, the people of the state are responding to the tough choices the President made to save the auto industry -- one in eight jobs in Ohio dependent on the auto industry.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about a great deal.\xc2\xa0 Also, the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on manufacturing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the people of Ohio aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking for a President who is going to support tax credits for companies that ship jobs overseas, or support incentives to help millionaires and billionaires and not the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the race has been very stable.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not this ad specifically -- obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been up on the air with a response ad.\xc2\xa0 This has been dominating the media in the state for eight days now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also trickled into other states -- the Denver Post wrote an editorial about it, and The New York Times, many papers.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a step you take, running an ad like this full of false statements, if you think you\xe2\x80\x99re winning the state.\xc2\xa0 This is a clear sign that they\xe2\x80\x99re worried that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to crack the nut in Ohio because it\xe2\x80\x99s been so stable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, are those readouts of the President\xe2\x80\x99s calls today, are they going to come on paper or are they coming --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll provide them.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To the pool?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To the pool, yes.\xc2\xa0 A lot of them will happen in the air.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really quickly on this -- obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re a week out; we\xe2\x80\x99ll be post-election and everything is going to turn towards the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 Is the President doing anything at all to prepare for that in advance?\xc2\xa0 Or has that all been pushed off until after November 6th?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The administration, under the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, is always working on the issues of budget policy, and that work continues.\xc2\xa0 The challenges posed by the so-called fiscal cliff are well known, and the opportunity that Congress has had -- the House of Representatives in particular -- to mitigate some of those challenges has been available to Republicans in the House for many months now, ever since the Senate passed an extension of the tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Republicans in the House have refused to pass that measure, choosing instead to hold hostage tax cuts for the middle class to the wealthiest 2 percent of the American people. That\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has said and believes that after the election we will be able to come together in a bipartisan way to resolve these issues and to deal with our deficit and debt challenge with a balanced proposal that reflects an overwhelming consensus among experts and the American people about how we should get this done.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to tackling those issues after the election.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any more thought to the idea of a \xe2\x80\x9csecretary of business\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to -- I mean, one of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked a lot about is that he wanted to continue the conversation with the American people, post-election, in a way that he maybe didn\xe2\x80\x99t, according to him, in the first couple of years.\xc2\xa0 So is he going to pivot immediately off the election to try and sell some of these ideas to voters?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will be engaging directly after the election in moving forward on the number of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, holding events, those kinds of things.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no schedule announcements to make for you.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously focused on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in the next several days.\xc2\xa0 And as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, changes come about very quickly in response to events -- some of them unpredicted.</p>\n<p>The point I\xe2\x80\x99ll make is that the President is committed to working to find solutions to these challenges.\xc2\xa0 There is a clear path to resolving them, when we talk about our budget and fiscal issues, that has broad support among the American people, broad support from Democrats, independents, and Republicans, except those who are leaders in the House of Representatives, by and large.</p>\n<p>On the issue of his approach to streamlining government -- and specifically, to asking Congress for the authority that every President from Herbert Hoover to Ronald Reagan had to make proposals to streamline government -- he very much wants to see action on that.\xc2\xa0 And his initial proposal has to do with consolidating agencies that deal with business and exports and commerce.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s very committed to that proposal.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the proposal that has the support of the Chamber of Commerce and has the support of John Engler and others from the Business Roundtable because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>And it would save money -- $3 billion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And it would consolidate a lot of agencies so there\xe2\x80\x99s one location, one website, one phone number, one agency that handles all these different issues that have to deal with supporting American business and supporting exports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, earlier this year, the President didn\'t spend a whole lot of time in Wisconsin while he was going to many of the other swing states.\xc2\xa0 Now that it\xe2\x80\x99s really close here, looking back, does the campaign regret that he didn\'t spend a little bit more time in Wisconsin up until the end?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always known the state would be harder for us than it was in 2008.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We won by 14 point in 2008. Obviously, when Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his running mate, he\xe2\x80\x99s a native son, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make a big to-do about that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s basically moved into the state and spends a great deal of time there.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve put in money there; we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in money there.\xc2\xa0 And races change always as time goes on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had an organization on the ground there since 2008.\xc2\xa0 We think that continues to be helpful, and is one of the reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to win Wisconsin on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>But, no, we certainly don\'t look back and have any regrets about where we spent time or where we spent resources.\xc2\xa0 Any campaign, you always need to be flexible and always need to be moving with where the state of the race is going.\xc2\xa0 And when the Romney team put in money there, when they decided that Paul Ryan would pitch a tent, move into his home state, we knew we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to cede the state, and we knew we were going to spend money, and fortunately we had the resources to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow is the final jobs report before the election. It\xe2\x80\x99s the last snapshot that voters will have of the jobs picture in this country.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have any bearing on voters when they head to the polls on Tuesday regardless of what the numbers show?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I, of course, do not have the numbers, so I have nothing to provide.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know what the numbers are.\xc2\xa0 No one does.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of what they are, the President is still going to feel there\xe2\x80\x99s more we need to do to help the economy recover at a faster rate, put more people back to work.\xc2\xa0 As he says every day and he\xe2\x80\x99ll say today, until everybody who wants a job has a job, his job is not done.\xc2\xa0 And that won\xe2\x80\x99t change.</p>\n<p>We also know that people at home are making their decisions based on where we take the economy from here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question any nonpartisan economists will tell you we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress.\xc2\xa0 The numbers tell you that story -- 5.2 million jobs, 31 straight months of private sector job growth.\xc2\xa0 But the President is the first to say there\xe2\x80\x99s more we need to do.\xc2\xa0 That is the same thing he\xe2\x80\x99ll say today, I expect the same thing he\xe2\x80\x99ll say tomorrow, and the same thing he\xe2\x80\x99ll say on Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Benghazi, overnight, FOX News had a report on another cable.\xc2\xa0 But the question is not about that.\xc2\xa0 These cables have been coming out, news reports have been coming.\xc2\xa0 How closely -- I know an investigation is ongoing -- but how closely is the President reading these reports, following them?\xc2\xa0 Is he asking questions?\xc2\xa0 Even the ones in The New York Times, elsewhere -- is he engaged in the investigation and receiving updates on the investigation, or is he waiting until it\xe2\x80\x99s complete?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These investigations are being conducted by both the FBI and the Accountability Review Board, and he is not participating in the investigation.\xc2\xa0 He is anticipating results that show us exactly what happened, who was responsible and what lessons we can learn from it in terms of how we ensure that it never happens again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to say he\xe2\x80\x99s withholding judgment and getting involved and asking questions and follow-ups until something comes out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was asked in interviews as recently as when he spoke with Brian Williams of NBC about what he expects.\xc2\xa0 He expects the investigations to be rigorous.\xc2\xa0 He is extremely focused on making sure that we find exactly what happened and who was responsible, and tracking down those who were responsible and bringing them to justice.</p>\n<p>And his responsibility as Commander-in-Chief is for the men and women that he sends into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 And that is often thought of as just members of the military, but it includes members of the diplomatic corps who serve in countries that are dangerous, but who do extraordinarily important work and who serve their country bravely in doing that work, in promoting American values and building relationships that help our national security interests.</p>\n<p>So the President is very committed to letting the facts come through and ensuring that we find out exactly what happened and who is responsible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, can I ask you about Bill Clinton?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s barnstorming the country, 13 events in four days, seven states.\xc2\xa0 Does he help you guys in tight races in some of these battlegrounds?\xc2\xa0 And does he have -- is he something of a super surrogate?\xc2\xa0 Does he have an influence that other surrogates for the President -- and for Mitt Romney, for that matter -- don\xe2\x80\x99t have?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly we\xe2\x80\x99d rather have President Bill Clinton out there than Newt Gingrich or whomever the Romney team has on their side.\xc2\xa0 But, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no one better to make the case for the middle class, for why the American people should send the President back for another four years, why he\xe2\x80\x99s the better fighter for the middle class than President Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p>He made that case during his convention speech.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been a tireless advocate for the President out on the campaign trail, day in and day out, event to event.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly powerful asset for us to have out there campaigning, and we\xe2\x80\x99re incredibly grateful for that.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the fact that the President today will be hitting three states, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be hitting one state with three stops tomorrow, countless events this weekend, and we have the First Lady out there; we have the Vice President out there; we also have President Clinton out there -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge added bonus for us to have such a powerful advocate out on the trail.</p>\n<p>And when they campaign together this weekend, that will be an even more powerful argument for why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to take a look at what\xe2\x80\x99s worked in the past and where we need to take those lessons and use them moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Chris Christie an added bonus also?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think Jay gave -- has given many readouts over the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to all of you to analyze the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 I will say the President was very laudatory of Governor Christie and the steps he\xe2\x80\x99s taken in New Jersey -- are well-deserved.\xc2\xa0 And they have a shared commitment to making sure that the state has the resources and the information they need as they recover.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:14 A.M.
