Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:44 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to your White House press briefing.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, I want to highlight some good health news this week.\xc2\xa0 As you saw, yesterday Indiana became the 28th state, plus the District of Columbia, to expand Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 This is great news for the estimated 350,000 Hoosiers, who will gain coverage.\xc2\xa0 And we commend Governor Pence for joining other Democrats and Republicans who have decided to expand Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 If the remaining 22 states expanded Medicaid, millions of more people would gain health coverage.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, as you also saw, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that 9.5 million people have selected a health insurance marketplace plan, or were automatically re-enrolled in the first two months of open enrollment for 2015.\xc2\xa0 And in the 37 states using Healthcare.gov, 2.5 million young people under age 35 have selected a plan or have been re-enrolled.\xc2\xa0 And in those same states, 87 percent of people have signed up for a qualified premium tax credit or other financial assistance to help make insurance more affordable.\xc2\xa0 This is great progress, and we encourage people who still need insurance to come and sign up by February 15th.</p>\n<p>With that, Nancy, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had a question about this quick dropping of the 529 tax plan as a distraction.\xc2\xa0 What does that say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to his policies if something can be dropped so quickly as a distraction?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Nancy.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to take a step back and look at the broader proposal the President has offered to ensure more middle-class families can get a college degree.</p>\n<p>First, he\xe2\x80\x99s proposed making two years of community college free for responsible students so that every American has access to at least two years or more of high school -- of high-quality schooling.\xc2\xa0 The President believes the surest way to the middle class is higher education.</p>\n<p>So some of you were on our trip to Knoxville a few weeks ago, where we were very transparent that we modeled our program on the national scale after the Republican governor\xe2\x80\x99s program in Tennessee.</p>\n<p>In addition, he\xe2\x80\x99s proposed -- the President has proposed nearly $50 billion in education tax reforms geared towards helping middle-class families afford the cost of college.\xc2\xa0 This proposal includes simplifying, consolidating, and better targeting tax-based financial aid.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s plan would cut taxes for 8.5 million families and students; simplify taxes for more than 25 million families and students that claim tax benefits.\xc2\xa0 All told, this would provide students working towards a college degree with up to $2,500 of assistance each year for five years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So while the program you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about is a very small component of that, it was a distraction, we decided to move forward with the rest of our plan, and we hope Congress moves on it shortly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there any thinking that by doing this there\xe2\x80\x99s a greater opportunity to strike a broader deal with Republicans on a broader package?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We absolutely are anxious to roll up our sleeves and get to work with both Republicans and Democrats on this.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, the fundamental pieces of this proposal are pieces that have enjoyed bipartisan support -- support from Republicans and Democrats -- in the past.\xc2\xa0 So we are absolutely hopeful that we can get to work on them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, what is your thinking about this talk on the Hill that the DHS funding deadline isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily that important because DHS employees would be the essential employees who would be working anyway?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked that, Nancy.\xc2\xa0 I think that Republicans have a choice to make right now.\xc2\xa0 They can decide to either refight an old political battle over the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions on immigration, or they can choose to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 This is a mess they created back in December when they decided to opt for that fight over the immigration reform actions the President took.\xc2\xa0 We believe that was unwise and misguided; that they now have a mess on their hands that they ought to be cleaning up.\xc2\xa0 They fought very hard for control of power in both chambers -- the House of Representatives and the Senate -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s now time for them to step up and govern.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any comment on the growing indication of a lawsuit by the House Republicans on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that House Republicans seem to be relying more and more on the courts these days to challenge the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we acted within the full bounds of the authority -- into the executive branch, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be defending that.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, back on 529s -- can you tell us who at the White House was involved in the original proposal, and how you came about deciding not to move forward?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget is the culmination of extensive conversations and discussions across the executive branch with agencies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a process that\xe2\x80\x99s housed at our Office of Management and Budget.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to give a tick-tock of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that that was a small part of a larger plan to help build economic opportunity for the middle class, because we feel that higher education is critical to that endeavor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair, though, to say that I guess budget officials were involved in making the proposal then?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that under the proposal that we put forth, that both senior staff at the White House and administration officials from across the agencies were involved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you expect to get the blowback from both sides that you did?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that what we expected was that when the President put forward this plan, in order to lift opportunities for the middle class to achieve higher education, we wanted to make sure that the focus was on expanding that economic opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Over the past six years, we\'ve seen significant economic progress across this country, and that includes, by the way, the longest stretch of job creation in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, and last year marking the highest number of job growth for a calendar year since the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>But we\'ve also seen that the middle class hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always enjoyed the prosperity that some at the top have.\xc2\xa0 So what the President is focused on and what we expected was to have a conversation now about middle-class economics, so that more and more Americans in the middle class could enjoy that prosperity.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 On another topic, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the new Greek Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s short tenure so far, and his desire and efforts to renegotiate the bailout package with Europe?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jeff.\xc2\xa0 We do, in fact, look forward to working with the new Prime Minister and his new government.\xc2\xa0 The Greek people have taken many difficult but important steps to lay out the groundwork for the economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 As a longstanding friend and ally, the United States will continue to support their efforts and those of the international community to strengthen the foundation of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s long-term prosperity.\xc2\xa0 We also continue to discuss ways that Europe can boost demand in job creation to help foster an environment that is supportive of reforms in Greece and elsewhere in Europe.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s definitely a situation that we\'re monitoring closely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you be specific as to whether you support Greece\xe2\x80\x99s desire to renegotiate its bailout terms?\xc2\xa0 Or are you coming down more on the side of Germany, which is the big creditor in this package?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s important to note that European leaders have made clear that they want Greece to remain in the Euro area, while respecting its commitments to reform.\xc2\xa0 And so the United States supports those efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he take a side on that particular question?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, we remain in communications with IMF and European leaders on the measures necessary to secure that progress that Greece has achieved.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to continue to monitor the situation.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to loop back on immigration first.\xc2\xa0 I know that you said it\'s time for Republicans to get to work on a solution, and I guess I\'m curious what your guys\xe2\x80\x99 parameters for that solution would be.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve threatened to veto anything that would override the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive action.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s been talk on Capitol Hill of Republicans, including maybe something on border security, maybe something on H1B visas.\xc2\xa0 Can you envision the President signing a bill that includes -- that\'s not a kind of clean bill, like funding as it were, but includes some of those provisions?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Our view is we want a clean DHS funding bill.\xc2\xa0 If you look at where we are, again, over the past six years, we are now at a point where Republicans fought very hard for majorities in both the House and the Senate, and a few months ago they achieved just that.\xc2\xa0 So it is now time for them to help fund the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 It\'s unimaginable to me that Republicans would risk defunding that agency which is responsible for aviation security, which is responsible for the United States Secret Service, which is responsible for enforcement of our immigration laws.\xc2\xa0 So our view is we want a year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of full funding.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer the question, which is would you accept a year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of full funding that included some of the provisions that Republicans have been trying to bargain into a broader comprehensive immigration bill but attached to DHS funding?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I\'ve seen some reports of Republicans sort of floating certain riders and such.\xc2\xa0 Our bright line thus far has been we will veto anything that includes a rollback of the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Short of that, I\'m not going to be in a position to sort of negotiate on those pieces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just on 529s -- after you guys rolled that out, there was a press call with senior administration officials in which they said they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t talked to Capitol Hill about this before it was kind of rolled out to us.\xc2\xa0 Was that a mistake?\xc2\xa0 Did not bringing Democrats in and kind of explaining to them how this tax plan was going to work lead to the sort of mutiny that we saw?\xc2\xa0 We saw Nancy Pelosi kind of get in the President\xe2\x80\x99s ear about this.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think, Justin, that you saw, in the wake of the State of the Union, widespread, if not unanimous support from Democrats on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to make college more affordable and more accessible for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 Again, this particular piece was becoming a distraction.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want that to jeopardize the broader plan, so that\'s why we announced what we did.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to the Jordanian government expressing a willingness to give in to demands of ISIL to release a convicted terrorist to gain release of their pilot who\xe2\x80\x99s been held hostage?\xc2\xa0 What does the White House make of this?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jon, as you know, our policy is that we don\'t pay ransom, we don\'t give concessions to terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of details on the negotiations between the Jordanians and the Japanese, I\'m going to refer you to their governments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but my question is -- okay, so we don\'t -- the United States government will not pay ransom, will not give in to demands.\xc2\xa0 Do we think it is a bad idea if another government does exactly that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that this is a longstanding policy that predates this administration, and it\'s also one that we\'ve communicated to our friends and allies across the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you announced, the White House announced that there would be a review of our hostage negotiation policy back in November.\xc2\xa0 What has happened with that review?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 That review is underway, Jon, and that review is being led by our counterterrorism director, Lisa Monaco.\xc2\xa0 This is a review that takes a look at our internal processes on this.\xc2\xa0 It was prompted by the increasing number of U.S. citizens taken hostage by terrorist groups overseas, the extraordinary nature of recent hostage cases.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President directed this review to be conducted.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a status update for you on that, but as soon as we do we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is a -- you say the United States government does not give in to demands, does not pay hostage -- does not pay ransom.\xc2\xa0 But how is what the Jordanians are talking about doing any different than what the United States did to get the release of Bergdahl -- the releasing prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay to the Taliban, which is clearly a terrorist organization?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, this was highly discussed at the time.\xc2\xa0 And prisoner swaps are a traditional, end-of-conflict interaction that happens.\xc2\xa0 As the war in Afghanistan wound down, we felt like it was the appropriate thing to do.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s bedrock commitment as Commander-in-Chief is to leave no man or woman behind.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the principle he was operating under.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what the Jordanians are operating under?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the Taliban is still conducting terrorist attacks, so you can\xe2\x80\x99t really say that the war has ended as far as they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d also point out that the Taliban is an armed insurgency; ISIL is a terrorist group.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t make concessions to terrorist groups.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Taliban is a terrorist group?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the Taliban -- the Taliban is an armed insurgency.\xc2\xa0 This was a winding-down of the war in Afghanistan, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why this arrangement was dealt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our view is, as the President said at the time, which is, as Commander-in-Chief, when he sends men and women into armed combat, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave anyone behind.\xc2\xa0 That was the commitment he was following through on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and just one other topic.\xc2\xa0 On the question of Iran, of course the President made it clear he would veto the sanctions bill if Congress did it -- saying it would interfere with negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Now Senator Menendez and nine other Democrats who all support that bill have conceded to the White House that they will not support a sanctions bill until March 24th; that\xe2\x80\x99s the date that you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to have a framework agreement.\xc2\xa0 So does the veto threat go away after March 24th?\xc2\xa0 Because they say they want to vote on it right after March 24th if Iran has not agreed to that framework agreement.\xc2\xa0 So will you -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve now made a big concession to the White House that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold off.\xc2\xa0 Will that veto threat be dropped on March 24th if there is no framework agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jon, the President does indeed appreciate the recognition that our negotiators need continued time and space to pursue this diplomatic option.\xc2\xa0 We welcome the commitment by Senator Menendez and others to vote against, as you point out, the sanctions bill on the floor right now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with Congress on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question is, does the veto threat go away on March 24th if there is no agreement, if the Iranians have not agreed to a broad framework?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jon, the President has made clear the importance of the end-of-March deadline in our own pursuit of a political framework there.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to certainly engage Congress at that point, just like we have been thus far.\xc2\xa0 And if we determine that negotiations have failed, we have always said we\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first ones to move for sanctions; I think the President has said that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take a day or two, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a determination we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make based on the progress of the negotiations at that point.</p>\n<p>Michael.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic.\xc2\xa0 Senator Burr last week sent a letter to the White House requesting that the administration send all copies of the full torture report that it got from the Senate back to the Senate because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that it should have gotten it in the first place.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration be sending the full 6,700-page copy -- the copies that it has of the full torture report back to the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be honest with you, Mike, I did not see that letter.\xc2\xa0 I will say, it was under the President\xe2\x80\x99s directive that the un-redacted version of the report be made public.\xc2\xa0 So I think we have a strong record of transparency on that front, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a particular response to that specific request.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you follow up on that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take a look.\xc2\xa0 Edward-Isaac Dovere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Full name.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Senator Feinstein issued a 15-point dissection of the report about the CIA snooping on the committee computers.\xc2\xa0 Josh had expressed a lot of -- \xe2\x80\x9ca lot of confidence\xe2\x80\x9d was the quote in that report.\xc2\xa0 Does what Senator Feinstein said about this raise any questions for you guys now about that confidence that you had in it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\'re 0 for 2, because I did not see Senator Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s release either.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we continue to have confidence in that report.\xc2\xa0 I know that a lot of professionals worked a long time on that report.\xc2\xa0 The President felt it was strong.\xc2\xa0 It was important to make sure that an un-redacted version was able to get into the public space because of the important dialogue that was happening on this issue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a response to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that\'s come up since that has raised any questions in the minds of --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Is the President watching any of confirmation hearings for Loretta Lynch?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know if the President has been watching C-SPAN at all this morning.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that we feel good about the confirmation hearing.\xc2\xa0 We think Ms. Lynch has made clear that she\xe2\x80\x99s proven the President correct when he said that it was pretty hard to find someone more qualified for this job than Loretta.\xc2\xa0 She has a 30-year career distinguishing herself as tough, fair, independent; and twice headed the most prominent U.S. attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office in the country -- twice being confirmed with bipartisan support by the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 But don\'t take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 This might be the first and only time we cite Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly from the podium.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But just a few days ago, he called her a hero and happy that she\xe2\x80\x99s the new Attorney General.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with all of that, she said that she\xe2\x80\x99s not Eric Holder.\xc2\xa0 And the President really admired Eric Holder for all of his work, particularly in areas of civil rights and criminal justice.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean for you for her to say that on the Hill when the President was so much of a supporter of Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s work?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We are very much a supporter of Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xc2\xa0 We think his record speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on civil rights enforcement, if you look at the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made prosecuting terrorists, increasing the rights of the LGBT community, and fighting tirelessly for voting rights, we feel good about Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s record at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 He has a strong record, an impressive record.\xc2\xa0 And we feel that Loretta Lynch will be just as strong of an Attorney General as Eric Holder was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you mean she will follow along that line even though she says she is not Eric Holder?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t have a chance to read Loretta Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s opening statement.\xc2\xa0 She might have been just being literal that she\xe2\x80\x99s not Eric Holder.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think that -- if you are -- (laughter) -- I think if you take a look at Loretta Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s testimony and her career and her credentials, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the values and the priorities and the public policies that she\xe2\x80\x99s going to pursue.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly felt comfortable with that, and that\'s why he nominated her.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about another veto threat, which is Keystone.\xc2\xa0 It might be the first one you get to exercise.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been very clear that he\xe2\x80\x99ll veto this, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been clear about why.\xc2\xa0 Is he against building the Keystone pipeline?\xc2\xa0 Or is this because he wants to preserve some kind of process and wait for the State Department to do its thing?\xc2\xa0 That\'s been very unclear.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Mara, to the contrary, I think we have been clear.\xc2\xa0 This Keystone project is undergoing review at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 That is a process that long predates this administration.\xc2\xa0 So we are opposed to any legislative maneuver that would circumvent that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is about the process, it is not about the Keystone pipeline?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, we are opposed to any legislative maneuver that would circumvent a process that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place for decades.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have an opinion after all this time on the Keystone pipeline?\xc2\xa0 The merits of the Keystone pipeline?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about this on many occasions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go ahead and parse his words.\xc2\xa0 Most recently, he addressed this in the State of the Union, where he said the United States government can set a larger bar, have a grander vision to rebuild infrastructure in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Keystone pipeline, as I said, this is undergoing review at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to wait until the State Department makes its final determination before voicing anything determinative.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how do you interpret what he said in the State of the Union?\xc2\xa0 Because it was kind of oblique.\xc2\xa0 He said, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set our sights so low as to a single pipeline.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s small potatoes and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter either way?\xc2\xa0 Or what?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has talked about this a couple of different times, and so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add at this point from the podium.\xc2\xa0 I will say the project is under review at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait for that review to complete before we weigh in.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s under careful consideration.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an elaborate process.\xc2\xa0 Now that the Nebraska court has weighed in, that route can now be assessed.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge that process.</p>\n<p>Kristen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to try to nail down a little bit more why you abandoned the plan to tax the 529 college savings funds.\xc2\xa0 Of course, there were those reports that Minority Leader Pelosi was pressing President Obama on Air Force One, as well as Chris Van Hollen.\xc2\xa0 Were those conversations the straw that broke the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back, essentially?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Those conversations were indicative of the distraction that this was becoming.\xc2\xa0 And the President put forth a bold proposal to make college more affordable for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want this to be a stumbling block that would jeopardize the rest of the package.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you call it a distraction.\xc2\xa0 Do you still think this is a good policy?\xc2\xa0 There was so much backlash, particularly from middle-class Americans, who said we really value these plans.\xc2\xa0 So do you still stand behind that as a good policy?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We do.\xc2\xa0 And again, even at the time, before yesterday -- as my colleague, Josh Earnest, said -- we would have only implemented this particular piece alongside a much broader package, which would have amounted to $50 billion in tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have a lot of people saying, though, that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy those plans if they came along with the tax.\xc2\xa0 So I guess just in keeping with that, is that really good policy, when you have so many people saying, well, then the plans become useless essentially?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\xe2\x80\x99d characterize it that way.\xc2\xa0 I do think, again, this particular piece, which was $1 billion over 10 years, compared to a $50-billion program, was a small, tiny piece of a program we wanted to implement on behalf of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the First Lady is getting some criticism for not wearing a head scarf.\xc2\xa0 Does she have a reaction to that criticism?\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s getting some criticism on Twitter, particularly, I guess, in Arabic.\xc2\xa0 So what is her reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Does she think that\xe2\x80\x99s fair or justified?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kristen, I saw those reports, and the attire the First Lady wore on this trip was consistent with what First Ladies in the past have worn -- First Lady Laura Bush, what Secretary Clinton wore on her visits to Saudi Arabia, Chancellor Merkel on her visits to Saudi Arabia, and including other members of the United States delegation at the time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ted Cruz, Senator Ted Cruz just tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cKudos to FLOTUS for standing up for women and refusing to wear Sharia-mandated head scarfs in Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 Nicely done.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Was that her intention, to send that message?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to a tweet from Senator Ted Cruz.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the First Lady very much enjoyed her visit to both India and Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 She felt like she was warmly welcomed by the King there.\xc2\xa0 They had a very good discussion that included catching up on their families, and also a new school that the King had built to help 60,000 women get educated.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Back to 529 -- Republicans have introduced a bill now that would actually expand those 529 college accounts.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House support a bill like that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw those press reports, and I can tell you that my friends in the policy shops and the legislative shops are taking a look at that.\xc2\xa0 Our focus is on working with Congress to deliver the larger package of education tax relief the President proposed, which, again, does have bipartisan support, as well as the President\xe2\x80\x99s broader package of tax relief for child care and working families -- again, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, paid for by closing the trust fund loophole and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United States continues to conduct drone strikes in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Previously, this was done with the support and cooperation of the Yemeni government, but now there isn\xe2\x80\x99t one.\xc2\xa0 Are we continuing to do this on our own?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not putting me on the spot to confirm any activity like that, but I will say that the political instability in Yemen has not forced us to suspend our counterterrorism operations in the past -- or suspend our counterterrorism operations there.</p>\n<p>As we have in the past, we will continue to take action to disrupt continuing and imminent threats to the United States and our citizens.\xc2\xa0 We continue to partner with Yemeni security forces in this effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think the short answer to your question is, our relationship with the Yemenis was not bound to just one person.\xc2\xa0 We have a multifaceted relationship with folks over there, and we continue to be in touch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just one person.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no government, effectively.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, our relationship was not confined to just one individual.\xc2\xa0 We were working with the Yemeni security forces and other parties over there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no matter what the Yemenis think, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Bill, again, I think even as the President has made clear, our counterterrorism operations have not stopped.\xc2\xa0 The President believes if there\xe2\x80\x99s a threat emanating from that region, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take action.</p>\n<p>Wow -- Jim.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Took a while to scan over to this side of the room.\xc2\xa0 Speaking of drones, following that crash landing here at the White House on Monday, does the White House believe that the grounds here are adequately protected from drones?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We do, we do.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the safety and security of the White House grounds is the mission of the -- is one of the missions of the United States Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 We have full confidence in them to accomplish that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that one of the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to detail the sort of security infrastructure around the White House.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to the Secret Service for what they are willing to share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I will also say that this technology is not new to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 This is something they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working through for some time.\xc2\xa0 And so they also are constantly reviewing emerging technologies.\xc2\xa0 This is no different, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for any details they can share on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the White House looked at all at this operator\xe2\x80\x99s story?\xc2\xa0 It was reported out by the Secret Service that he was only using it for recreational reasons.\xc2\xa0 Does that fly with you guys?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well done.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A little Josh thrown in there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s good, that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 Jim, the investigation is squarely housed at Secret Service, so they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who are completing that investigation.\xc2\xa0 I expect it to be fair, thorough and tough.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President told Fareed Zakaria with CNN that he reiterated the explanation that you guys gave that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu within a couple of weeks of the Israeli elections.\xc2\xa0 Have they had a chance to speak at all?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the President to read out right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken at all, so --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s questions about the 529 plans, it does seem as though -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, but there are a lot of people out there who really believe in these 529 plans.\xc2\xa0 And I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious -- did the White House explore that?\xc2\xa0 Did you guys look, in putting together this policy, this proposal for the budget, did you look at the popularity of these programs and the fact that so many people out there are invested in these?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what would have been the impact on all of those Americans if they had to all of a sudden figure out a different way to save for college?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it just seems as though it\xe2\x80\x99s a very inexpensive item in the budget but a major headache that was created by putting this out there.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you noting the reality, that this is a relatively inexpensive and small piece of business for us.\xc2\xa0 Our proposal, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, is to deliver nearly $50 billion in education tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The 529 proposal is about 3 percent of that nearly $50-billion tax reform package.\xc2\xa0 And that being said, the President is very interested in working with Congress to move forward on his broader package.</p>\n<p>As you point out, this was a concern for both Democrats and Republicans on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 We decided to take that to heart.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes we come out here, face a lot of heat for not listening to the Hill.\xc2\xa0 We decided that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want this to become a distraction, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we want to move forward on the rest of the package.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you think maybe you should have talked to the Hill beforehand?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that we have extensive conversations with members of Congress and their staff.\xc2\xa0 I think, by and large, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen near unanimous support, at least from the Democrats, on a lot of the goals and the pieces of the education reform proposal.</p>\n<p>Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Annie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s another piece in the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan that is very popular among middle-class families that\xe2\x80\x99s ending, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the child care flexible savings accounts.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any discussion in the White House about also taking a step back from that proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals for child care and education tax benefits invest nearly $1 billion more in middle-class families while making it a lot easier for families to take advantage of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can I ask about the drilling of oil on the Atlantic Coast?\xc2\xa0 There are probably lots of folks along the coast who are thinking, what did the President decide after the Deepwater accident that made him confident that this was the way to go.\xc2\xa0 Can you just describe how the President arrived at his decision that this would be safe environmentally and worth doing at this time?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the question, Alexis.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if it was yesterday or earlier this week, the Department of Interior did release its five-year plan.\xc2\xa0 That plan did make available additional areas for drilling and for leasing.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that that was just a preliminary step, that this is a plan that\'s now open for feedback and for public input both from the public and specific stakeholders.\xc2\xa0 So this plan is by no means final.</p>\n<p>And so before that\'s locked it, there will be plenty of time to comment.\xc2\xa0 I think more largely speaking, this is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s all-of-the-above energy approach.\xc2\xa0 The United States of America is now the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest producer of domestic -- of oil.\xc2\xa0 And we are at a historic low for imports of oil and natural gas. \xc2\xa0So the President feels good about his all-of-the-above energy approach.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, energy prices are down, production is up, and so I think the announcement by the Department of Interior yesterday was consistent with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, just to follow up on Mara\xe2\x80\x99s question, is there any correlation in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind in terms of this policy announcement between drilling on the Atlantic Coast and his dissatisfaction with the Keystone pipeline\xe2\x80\x99s utility or job creation or necessity?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- can you ask your question one more time?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy on drilling, the need for drilling on the Atlantic Coast, relate at all to his dissatisfaction with the arguments for the Keystone pipeline?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, the Keystone pipeline project is still under review at the Department of State, so it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard for me to weigh in here on that right now.</p>\n<p>In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to increase oil production, we think the numbers speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s all-of-the-above energy approach.\xc2\xa0 Our numbers on solar, wind, with domestic oil production are all high, and the President is proud of that record.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to release his budget on Monday.\xc2\xa0 And I have another 529 question.\xc2\xa0 If the President believed that the 529 proposal was the right policy and now he\xe2\x80\x99s arguing that he\xe2\x80\x99s changed his mind because it became a political distraction, how are we supposed to appraise the blowback that we\'re going to hear to the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget on Monday?\xc2\xa0 Are the policies that get some sort of political blowback distractions that should be jettisoned from the budget?\xc2\xa0 How do we evaluate that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Why are you anticipating blowback from the budget?\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be received with universal acclaim?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>I do want to give you one heads-up for your planning, which is the 529 piece will still be in the written budget that\'s released.\xc2\xa0 The announcement yesterday was made after the book was in the shop to be produced.\xc2\xa0 So just for your planning.</p>\n<p>But the President, broadly speaking, is very excited about this budget.\xc2\xa0 We think it reflects a lot of priorities that the President talked about in his State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a product of an exhaustive process that crosses many different agencies here in the administration.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to reflect the fundamental values of building out the middle class to help sustain economic progress.\xc2\xa0 For us, that includes making paychecks go further, making sure young people have the skills they need to succeed, and making sure higher education is more attainable for Americans across the board.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer my question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you give it another shot?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you just set a new way to evaluate the budget, right?\xc2\xa0 If something becomes a distraction, the President will consider eliminating it.\xc2\xa0 So my question to you is, as the President prepares and releases the budget on Monday, and there is political dissatisfaction of elements of it, will the President consider eliminating those?\xc2\xa0 Did he just set a new way of evaluating, even though he thought the 529 policy made sense?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not how we see it, Alexis.\xc2\xa0 The President, in his budget -- if you\'re looking for clues for what\xe2\x80\x99s in the budget and how it\'s going to be received, I would draw you to the State of the Union text where he laid out pretty firm plans for strengthening our economy, improving the education and skills of our workforce, accelerating scientific discovery, bolstering manufacturing, and keeping our nation safe.\xc2\xa0 Those are the fundamental tenets of our budget.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I\'m not going to preview what\xe2\x80\x99s in there or what the reaction is going to be or how we\'re going to respond to the reaction right now.</p>\n<p>Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Byron.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 The President, in his 2006 book, had a lot of praise for tax-free education savings accounts, which would encompass plans like the 529.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say he\xe2\x80\x99s changed his mind on this issue?\xc2\xa0 He also, in 2007, voted to make 529 tax savings permanent.\xc2\xa0 So has he flip-flopped? Has he changed his mind on this issue over the years?\xc2\xa0 And perhaps, why?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I think if we take a look back at this proposal, it was part of a larger $50-billion proposal to make economic opportunity for the middle class more attainable by making college more accessible.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s driving the President, that\'s his North Star.\xc2\xa0 When he wakes up every morning, that\'s what he wants to achieve.\xc2\xa0 So this was a small piece of a much broader plan to get there.\xc2\xa0 Because this did not enjoy the support from members of the House and the Senate, we wanted to make sure that this didn\xe2\x80\x99t become a distraction to help jeopardize the rest of the plan.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we made the decision that we did.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we want to get to work on the rest of the plan as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But has he changed his mind over the course of a couple years about, I guess, educational financing and the way that the tax code should treat educational savings?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think the President, by virtue of the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s released over the past 10 days, has been very clear where he stands on funding higher education and making sure that is more attainable for people in the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And I can also tell you that the President did agree with the decision to not move forward with this particular proposal yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question following up on what the President was asked in the YouTube interview?\xc2\xa0 He was asked about the legalization of marijuana, and he cited federal law as a reason that marijuana remains illegal.\xc2\xa0 But federal law also contains a provision for rescheduling drugs within the administration.\xc2\xa0 Does he have a position on that aspect?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Which interview are you saying?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The YouTube interview -- I\'m sorry -- he was asked about marijuana legalization.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Oh, got it.\xc2\xa0 I thought you said Jeffrey Toobin.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a lot of information on that right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 New Jersey Governor Chris Christie this weekend is planning on going overseas to London; he becomes one in a long list of potential Republican presidential candidates to make a trip abroad, and to London specifically.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, does the President view those trips as helpful, hurtful, or relevant to the overall conduct of U.S. foreign policy?\xc2\xa0 And also, as somebody who came from the Senate to the White House and who took a trip abroad, does he view those trips as potentially helpful in preparing to be Commander-in-Chief?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As tempting as it is, I\'m not going to take the bait and take a 2016 question.\xc2\xa0 But I appreciate the effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would such a trip -- are there risks involved in such a trip if a U.S. official goes abroad and says something that\'s off-kilter?\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney, for example, when he went as a Republican nominee, made several missteps.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I remember that trip.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I\'m going to let others judge the wisdom of those trips.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an administration view on eliminating the tax-exempt status on big-money sports leagues like the NHL and the NFL?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 If there is, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come prepared to share it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you get back to me on that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will, yes.</p>\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about Jeremy Bird, who served as a national field director during the 2012 reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 He is said to be actively working in Israel as part of a concerted effort against Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just curious, given all the friction between the administration right now and Jerusalem, how concerned are you with his activities right now?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I haven\'t see those reports, but I will tell you that we feel very good about the relationship we have with Israel.\xc2\xa0 They are our closest ally in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 The President talks to Prime Minister Netanyahu more than any other foreign leader.\xc2\xa0 They spoke, I believe, just a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 So that relationship is as solid as ever, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have anything more for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be fair to say you would discourage other former administration either officials or those who have worked with the administration from engaging in such activity?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have a lot on my plate.\xc2\xa0 Taking to task what former administration officials do once they leave the White House is not something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to engage in right here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about the relationship, Eric, between the Pentagon and the White House.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism about micromanagement, heavy handedness, the inability to sort of formulate a coherent plan given the second-guessing that happens often at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize the relationship between the White House and the Pentagon?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be helpful if you -- are there any specifics you\'re asking about?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, specifically Leon Panetta, Robert Gates, and even more recently comments attributed off the record to others in very high and senior-level positions have been critical of micromanagement from the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 This is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed at length from here.\xc2\xa0 But we, of course, always deeply value and respect the input of our military leadership.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that is placed at paramount value here at the White House and something that goes into every consideration the President makes as Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, the President is the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 The friction with the Pentagon, I believe, those who have been covering this White House much longer than I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working here will tell you that\xe2\x80\x99s something that predates this administration.\xc2\xa0 So we believe we have good relationships with the military leaders, and most importantly the President has an open ear, and values their input around the table or over the telephone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 You were talking about an all-of-the-above energy strategy earlier, and I just wanted to follow up.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the House passed a bill about liquefied natural gas exports.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We think the bill is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Because the Department of Energy has already taken steps to modernize the LNG export approval process and ensure applications are looked at efficiently and expeditiously.\xc2\xa0 So we believe the process is working well, and that bill is totally unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary because any sale of LNG would actually be bogged down by bureaucratic red tape?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We actually think the process is working well, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen much evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the other side of the issue of natural gas, any reaction -- I know I asked Josh about this a couple weeks ago. The states like New York who have banned fracking of natural gas, the White House wants to push -- they want to drill on the southeast coast of the United States for oil.\xc2\xa0 What about states that are opting out of some of the all-of-the-above positions?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Jared, I think as part of the DOI five-year plan that was released earlier this week, some areas were taken off the table, specifically in Alaska.\xc2\xa0 So we are open to working with stakeholders.\xc2\xa0 Again, the plan that was put forward by the Department of Interior is going to be subject to comment.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s subject to the public giving comments, but also specific stakeholders who have an area of expertise.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re open to that feedback, and we\'re going to be working through that moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, but what does the White House think of -- that\'s the Interior\xe2\x80\x99s position, but what does the White House think when states take themselves out of the equation?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We feel good about the list that Department of Interior has put forward.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to speculate on a list that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t put forward or other states that may or may not be speaking up on this.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Eric.\xc2\xa0 I also have a question about the YouTube interview.\xc2\xa0 The President said he hopes the Supreme Court comes to the right decision on pending litigations on marriage rights for same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 What will the right decision look like?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President -- I think we can all guess.\xc2\xa0 The President believes in the pillar of equality.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken out to this many times, but that marriage should be something that\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyed by every man and every woman.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And every man and every woman, does that mean a 50-state ruling striking down on all remaining state bans prohibiting same-sex marriage?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I am just not an expert on sort of what the actual details are pending before the court, so I\'m going to leave it to the President to voice our view.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also in the interview, the President said a lot of nice things about same-sex couples, such as they\xe2\x80\x99re good parents and they\xe2\x80\x99re brothers and sisters.\xc2\xa0 He also referred to their lives as a \xe2\x80\x9clifestyle choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President regret using that phrase?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about using that phrase.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this are well known.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should we take away from that statement that the President thinks that being gay is a choice?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.</p>\n<p>Fred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Yes, today Loretta Lynch was up on the Hill and she said today she believes illegal immigrants have an obligation to work, and that she said, regardless of how they came here, the obligation to work is one that\xe2\x80\x99s shared by everyone in the country.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that people who are here unlawfully have an obligation and a right to work?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that as part of the immigration -- both the executive action that he announced, but also a pillar of the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate with both Democrats and Republicans and that was blocked by the House leadership from even coming up to a vote -- that that restores accountability, that those immigrants can come out of the shadows, join the workforce, and pay taxes and be held accountable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That law was never passed, you remember.\xc2\xa0 So does the President believe that people who are here unlawfully now have an obligation to work and compete for jobs against Americans -- unemployed Americans, young Americans, et cetera?\xc2\xa0 His Attorney General -- his prospective Attorney General believes this.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with Lynch on this, that people who are here unlawfully have an obligation to work?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think the people who under the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive action plan can now come out of the shadows, get a job and pay taxes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- all people who are here unlawfully.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean they include the non -- do all 12 million have an obligation to work, or does the President have a disagreement with his nominee for the Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to admit, I know that hearing is ongoing, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to review that transcript before coming out here.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you something.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 --\xc2\xa0 answer back on that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will try my best.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:30 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
