EST</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President accomplish today what he hoped to?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you\'ve got, by all accounts, a very close race.\xc2\xa0 The President was happy to lend his voice in a race that he thinks is going to be about, as you heard him say, whose side are you on.\xc2\xa0 I think he delivered that message today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, tell us a little about the thinking in the White House, about contingency plans about how to get health care done, if you should lose this race.\xc2\xa0 Folks have said they\'re really working on that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, the plan to get health care passed is to continue to do what we\'re doing in ironing out the differences between the House and Senate.\xc2\xa0 I said this on Friday when I was asked, and I\'ll say it on Sunday on the ride home -- we think Martha Coakley is going to win this race.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t stress health care in his remarks today.\xc2\xa0 He seemed to be talking more about the bank tax.\xc2\xa0 Is that a strategic decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I think he set up -- and all the speakers set up -- whether you\'re going to be on the side of a bank, whether you\'re going to be on the side of the insurance industry, whether you\'re going to be on the side of big oil companies, or whether you\'re going to be on the side of, in this case, the people of Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, look, I think it was -- that was the theme of what this race has been, I think what the President will talk a lot about for the next year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a contingency plan question?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, let\'s turn this around where the mic is -- (laughter) -- and then -- so I can tell you that we think Martha Coakley is going to win the race.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about this AP story that says that one of the contingency plans would be having House Democrats vote for the Senate bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We should have a private conversation about what I think of the AP.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Guys, we\'re focused on two things:\xc2\xa0 ironing out the differences in the bills, which you know the President has spent a lot of time working on over the past few days; and we think Martha Coakley is going to win this race.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been working on ironing out since the Friday meeting -- has there been more --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There haven\'t been more joint meetings, and there weren\'t any scheduled today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about this coming week?\xc2\xa0 Has the President planned any more meetings?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the schedule, but my sense is -- I know staff is continuing to work out differences, and I have not seen the schedule in terms of what is upcoming this week, but I assume there will be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How close do you sense they are?\xc2\xa0 Maybe one more week would do it?\xc2\xa0 Or do you have any feelings --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think so.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s much -- I mean, look, I think they spent -- just on those two days alone they spent many hours working through a lot of the differences that remain, and I don\'t think they\'re that far from finishing that task.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask you to clarify -- you said you do expect in the coming week that there will be some further directive by the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the schedule, but I assume that if it\'s not finished by staff, then they would get together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there actually a deadline that you are setting at this stage to get this done in coming days?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just as soon as -- I mean, look, I think we\'re all hopeful to get this done as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to the volunteer project tomorrow, what\'s on tap for the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The volunteer thing is the big thing.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to go -- I think it\'s the Kennedy Center for the concert.\xc2\xa0 And then there will be a short ceremony in the Oval Office, and we\'ll give -- send out some information on that, relating to Martin Luther King Day, a little bit later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will be there anything else -- on election day in Massachusetts -- additional robo calls or anything else on get out the vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he recorded a robo call earlier last week.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has -- I don\'t know of any additional stuff that he\'ll do between now and election night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Bayh said that Obama is wasting precious political capital with health care.\xc2\xa0 What would you say to his -- he said that in the New York Times today.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thank Senator Bayh for his support on health care.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- look, as we\'ve said many times, the President came in and had to deal with issues that were on his plate.\xc2\xa0 The issues that we\'ve -- some of the issues that we\'ve had to deal with are fiscal issues, the fact that health care is costing too much for companies and for small businesses.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The best way to address our fiscal issues in the short term was through changing the cost curve of what the federal government and what state and local governments are paying for health care, and to ensure that people had accessible coverage that businesses can afford.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I certainly know the President doesn\'t believe that the time we\'ve spent dealing on health care has been a waste of anybody\'s time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you have a sense of how much time the President might start spending in the next month, two months, before November -- you know, helping raise money, campaigning, that sort of thing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a -- I have not seen a longer-term schedule on political travel.\xc2\xa0 But, Chuck, I presume he\'ll spend a decent amount of time, as he has, raising money for the party committees and in campaigning for individual candidates.</p>\n<p>Look, I say this, I think if -- look at what the President said today.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a lot of what 2010 is going to be about, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s going -- you know, people are going to have to decide whether the people they have in Washington are on the side of protecting the big banks, whether they\'re on the side of protecting the big oil companies, whether they\'re on the side of protecting insurance companies, or whether they\'re on the people\'s side.\xc2\xa0 I think what he laid out today is what you\'ll hear him talk a lot about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he frustrated that health care has become such a divisive issue, that what he said is so great in the bill is not translating to people, and it\'s really -- is Massachusetts kind of the issue --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d keep in mind one thing.\xc2\xa0 Massachusetts went through this exercise, and because of it has health care, right?\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, I do think that\'s one backdrop when you come to Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s the state that has understood the importance of ensuring health care for the people who live here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, look, do I think an outsized number of issues that have exceedingly little to do with the real scope of the bill have taken up most of people\'s times and imagination?\xc2\xa0 Undoubtedly.\xc2\xa0 Undoubtedly.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to say that it wasn\'t time -- it was -- overall the issue of health care wasn\'t well spent.</p>\n<p>And look, once the bill passes, the President will spend a lot of time talking about what\'s in that bill.\xc2\xa0 The minute he signs that bill into law, a child with a preexisting condition will be able to get health insurance for the first time in that child\'s life.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a big deal for that person.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a big deal for that family.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, in his speech, really didn\'t focus too much on health care.\xc2\xa0 He focused on other issues -- banking fees, Wall Street\'s greed, that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 Was there a purposeful reason behind that, in that he\'s mindful of this is a divisive issue and there\'s a -- polls are showing it\'s not a very popular thing right now for many in Massachusetts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We addressed this a little while ago, but, no, this is -- I think if you look at what he said and what other speakers said, there was a hefty element of whether you\'re on the side of insurance companies or whether you\'re on the side of the people.\xc2\xa0 So I think he addressed it.</p>\n<p>This election -- the election on Tuesday is more than about health care, right?\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the only issue that people are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 They\'re concerned about jobs.\xc2\xa0 They\'re concerned about whether we\'re free of foreign oil\xc2\xa0 -- or free of our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 They\'re concerned about the banks and our financial system.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a whole lot of issues on their plate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sounds like a more populist theme than you ran on last year -- or two years ago.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, go back and read what -- I mean, go back and read what the President said at the Iowa J-J dinner.\xc2\xa0 I think it was very much the theme of putting Washington back on the side of average, everyday, working Americans, because I think for -- I think throughout 2007 and 2008, leading up to that election, there was a pervasive feeling on the side of people in this country that Washington wasn\'t on their side.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I actually think that goes back much further than the election year.\xc2\xa0 There are people in this country that were struggling with jobs and the economy long before there was a financial crisis on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 And they wanted to know if Washington was going to help them, or continue to work to help the special interests.\xc2\xa0 So I think he spent a lot of time talking about it then, and he\'ll spend a lot of time talking about it now.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the themes that he had during the campaign was sort of we\'re all in this together.\xc2\xa0 And there were other Democratic candidates who of course, ran -- it was an "us versus them," or a "Wall Street versus Main Street."\xc2\xa0 Is he adopting a little bit more of a "two America"* strategy?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that, look, there\'s no doubt that we all are in this together, that we\'re -- I don\'t think the President believes that -- as he would say, you rise or fall -- you rise or fall together.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t -- go back to "red America, blue America," as he said in Boston in 2004.\xc2\xa0 I think what angered people, though, was this pervasive sense that Washington either didn\'t hear what was going on in the country, or didn\'t care.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what drove people to look at a guy like Barack Obama and make him President of the United States.</p>\n<p>All right?\xc2\xa0 All right, I\'ll let you get back to that buffalo dip.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n6:52 P.M.
