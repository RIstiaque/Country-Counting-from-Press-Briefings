EDT</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. \xc2\xa0Good afternoon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Robert, there\xe2\x80\x99s a church in Gainesville, Florida, that says it\xe2\x80\x99s going to go ahead and burn copies of the Koran to mark the 9/11 anniversary. \xc2\xa0Is the White House -- is there anything the White House is doing to discourage that or prevent them from going ahead with that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think the best place to look for the views of this administration would be to look at the -- look at what General Petraeus said over the weekend. \xc2\xa0We know that that type of activity -- we know that that type of activity is being transmitted back to places like Afghanistan, when General Petraeus obviously is our lead commander. \xc2\xa0As he said, it puts our troops in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. \xc2\xa0And obviously that -- any type of activity like that would be -- that puts our troops in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way would be a concern to this administration.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is there any thought from anyone at the White House to reach out to the pastor of the church --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have not heard of any.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you ready to say what the President is going to do Saturday to mark the 9/11 anniversary? \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The President will attend a memorial service at the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0I believe the Vice President will go to New York. \xc2\xa0And obviously the First Lady and former First Lady Laura Bush are in Pennsylvania. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the times on the event at the Pentagon with me.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The economic package that you\xe2\x80\x99re rolling out, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative strategy for that? \xc2\xa0Is this something he thinks can be passed before Election Day? \xc2\xa0And also, is he seeking passage of these measures as one big package or separate measures?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0On the second one, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to one package or several packages.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, I think what the President -- the President will tomorrow outline a series of the proposals, many of which you all have read about and reported on over the past several days, that he believes continue our strategy to getting our economy moving again and, more importantly, for long-term economic growth.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re under -- we understand what season we\xe2\x80\x99ve entered in Washington. \xc2\xa0We know that Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t be here for a lot of time. \xc2\xa0We certainly hope that there are measures, including some of the ones that the President will outline, that Congress will consider. \xc2\xa0If they don\xe2\x80\x99t do that prior to the election, the President and the economic team still believe that these represent some very important ideas in continuing along our path toward economic recovery.And as I said, most importantly, this is about -- and look, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about this a lot tomorrow in Cleveland -- this is about long-term economic growth. \xc2\xa0This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about the next 60 days or the next 90 days. \xc2\xa0This is about how do we get our economy fully back on track, how do we get the millions that want to work back to work, and how do we repair the economic damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on not just over the past two years but over the past 10 years. \xc2\xa0We didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into this overnight, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said countless times.</p>\n<p>But I think one of the things the President will do tomorrow is will go through the notion of for 10 years we saw rules written for the special interests. \xc2\xa0We saw a blind eye turned to some of their activities. \xc2\xa0We saw wages decrease. \xc2\xa0We saw families rightly more concerned about the future of their children and whether or not the economy that they were going to raise their children in was going to be one that was capable of passing on the American Dream to each and every one of their children.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are we likely to get an announcement this week on either the Consumer Agency job or CEA?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I have not gotten white smoke on that except to say -- obviously nothing that I know of today. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that at some point that may come during the week.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Your former budget director, Mr. Orszag, wrote in The New York Times today that the administration and Democrats should compromise with the Republicans in Congress and extend all of the Bush tax cuts for two years and then get rid of them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 One of the reasons for that, he said, in terms of keeping the tax cuts in place, is, \xe2\x80\x9cHigher taxes now would crimp consumer spending, further depressing the already inadequate demand for what firms are capable of producing at full tilt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So your OMB director is saying that if you guys go ahead with what you\xe2\x80\x99re proposing, which is allowing them to expire on the richest Americans --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Jake, I think that -- I think Peter was mostly -- if I read the article correctly, I think Peter was mostly discussing the permanence of and the extension of those that involved the middle class.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m specifically talking about this one -- yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re agreed --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I understand, I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re reading.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- on the middle-class part of it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think, in all honesty, in reading the article, I think Peter had a congressional relations hat on in terms of what political price Congress might have to go through to extend different things. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not the viewpoint that the President holds. \xc2\xa0The President --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you disagree that higher taxes, in terms of the Bush tax cuts expiring, would crimp consumer spending -- you disagree with that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think that if you make $250,000 a year in this economy, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably not putting off the purchase of a big-screen TV. \xc2\xa0I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think your consumer demand is if you make a quarter of a million dollars or $400,000 a year in this economy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re putting off the purchase of a new suit or a new car because you make $400,000 a year. \xc2\xa0If you made $40,000 a year, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re putting off a lot of purchases based on the fact that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it, and that impacts consumer demand.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you disagree with Peter?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the way I read the article, Jake, is that Peter is not making that argument about the high-end tax cuts. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s making that argument about the middle-class tax cuts, which the President certainly agrees that not extending them will certainly have an impact. \xc2\xa0The President will argue tomorrow that we should extend those middle-class tax cuts as in not doing so would most assuredly hurt our economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But again, I think if you\xe2\x80\x99re making $250,000 or $400,000 or $600,000 or $800,000 in this economy, you\xe2\x80\x99re not putting off the purchase of -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a great crush on -- or pullback in your consumer demand. \xc2\xa0This economy is not hurting people that make $800,000 a year, it\xe2\x80\x99s hurting families that are making $40,000 a year.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if could do a follow-up. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of polling out today, including an ABC News/Washington Post poll that indicates more Americans feeling negatively about the President and his job performance, especially about the economy. \xc2\xa0For the first time, numerically, more Americans think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies have hurt the economy than have helped the economy. \xc2\xa0Why -- I assume you think that they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong -- why are they wrong?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I -- first and foremost, Jake, obviously, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in here a number of times, there is and continues to be great frustration with where we are in this economy. \xc2\xa0Among those frustrated is the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a recession unlike virtually anything that anybody has seen in any of their lifetimes. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take, as the President will discuss on Wednesday, more than a two-year or less than two-year time period to get out of that hole. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why what he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about he believes will continue us on a road to recovery, but that recovery will certainly take some time. \xc2\xa0And I think in the end this President and this administration will be graded on what happens at the end of this road, not some place in between.I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, I think the American people are not concerned about the President\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers. \xc2\xa0I think the American people are concerned about whether or not they have a job, how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay their bills, the future of their children. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people are concerned about, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the task that the President will spend every day worrying about.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But a plurality think that what the President is doing is making matters worse.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I think by virtually any measure, our economy is in a better place than it was two years ago. \xc2\xa0There are, I think, Americans rightly concerned about our debt and our deficit, and the President understands that and has taken steps to introduce a budget that includes a freeze on non-security discretionary spending, and obviously will spend a decent amount of time in the next many months going through the medium and long term -- things that we need to do in the medium and long term to get our debt and deficit under control.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, since you mentioned the jobs picture, I just wanted to ask one more question about Peter Orszag, because he said specifically that letting all the Bush tax cuts expire will make the job situation worse. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one wants to make an already stagnating jobs market worse over the next year or two, which is exactly what would happen if the cuts expire as planned.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, my reading of this is that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You were talking about consumer spending before on jobs --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, Jake was talking about consumer spending and I was responding. \xc2\xa0Again, I do not believe -- I think if you -- if you are looking at -- Ed, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a broad band of economists that will tell you the best way to get the economy moving is to extend those tax cuts, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find them. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 When the President -- when President Bush signed the 2001 tax cuts into law -- I believe it was June of 2001 -- we were in the midst of a recession. \xc2\xa0Including the month he signed those tax cuts into law, the economy shed jobs for 15 of the next 16 months. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- if your argument is that these jobs -- or these tax cuts spur a great amount of jobs or economic growth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find an economist or series of economists -- certainly the CBO put together a list of all the things that might be done to get the economy moving again, and I think it was either 10 out of 10 or 12 out of 12. \xc2\xa0And certainly there\xe2\x80\x99s no historical data that would -- that you would point to.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you also have a lot of economists saying that if you raise taxes on the rich they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be less likely to hire people. \xc2\xa0Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that hurt the employment picture?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, 2 to 3 percent of small businesses would be affected in this. \xc2\xa0And most of those -- let\xe2\x80\x99s understand what those small businesses are. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a white-collar law firm that meets the technical definition of not a large number of people that are employed, okay? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about the mom-and-pop hardware store. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just not what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Related on the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic plan, last week from that podium you basically said there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a second stimulus plan. \xc2\xa0And then as the details start coming out and you add it up, the President is already proposing at least $350 billion in new money.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The net cost of the expensing is not -- is 30 --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you can get Congress to agree to the offsets, which is a big \xe2\x80\x9cif.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, no, the net -- no, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the R&amp;E -- research and experimentation tax credit funded by closing corporate loopholes. \xc2\xa0The expensing tax -- the increase in the expensing and the pulling forward of that in 2011 has a net cost over 10 years of $30 billion, because what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is taking a schedule for investment and depreciation that would be written off as part of your taxes; instead of over a several-year period of time at half, you\xe2\x80\x99re pulling all of that investment forward to one year. \xc2\xa0But that money then isn\xe2\x80\x99t written off in each of the successive years that the 10-year budget window is part of.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So I think if you look at -- I think if you were to add up infrastructure, the R&amp;E and this, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly less than $200 billion.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, you add it up, $200 billion, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s $200 billion, that\xe2\x80\x99s big money.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, it would be less -- $180 billion, $180 billion.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, so $180 billion -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of money.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0So why are you not calling it a stimulus plan? \xc2\xa0I mean, can\xe2\x80\x99t the President be straight with the American people and say, look, the first one, we think it saved or created 3.3 million jobs, but we need a second one?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- Ed, I listed a series of things that the President had done over the course of the last -- let\xe2\x80\x99s see, what\xe2\x80\x99s today -- it\xe2\x80\x99s September. \xc2\xa0If you go back to last August, not a month ago but a year and a month ago, we had Cash for Clunkers. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve extended unemployment insurance because -- for those that were -- for unemployed regardless of the number of weeks up to 99 you were going to lose your benefits. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve ensured that states aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to lay off teachers and firefighters when we need them most. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The President has taken steps along the way, beyond the Recovery Act itself, to do things that were necessary to continue to spur our economic recovery, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s being done here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a stimulus?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0You said a little while ago that we know what season we\xe2\x80\x99ve entered in Washington. \xc2\xa0I assume you meant the political season, when not much gets done on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0So why, then, did the President wait until now to introduce these tax cut proposals for businesses that Republicans have been calling for for not just months but for years?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, then we ought to be able to get this done pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the season you just said, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get done. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But if you supported --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why would the President wait for exactly the point --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But if you supported --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- when he knows things don\xe2\x80\x99t get to Congress to introduce this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Chip, let me just take the premise of your question. \xc2\xa0If you support -- if you, as somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s running for Congress, representing the other party --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, you know very well, you just said --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- this is the season when things don\xe2\x80\x99t get done.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Just help me understand the logic here. \xc2\xa0So then would you concede that the logic of it not getting done is simply because of politics?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Well, then you have to concede that the logic of the President introducing it now is because of politics.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no -- well, first of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who -- maybe there are people that have proposed 100 percent expensing of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0McCain did it in 2008.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the campaign he did it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The R&amp;E is --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A lot of this has been proposed by Republicans in one form or another.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the expansion and the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why would the President not have done it earlier this year or even last year?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the permanence of R&amp;E, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about that for years. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that the expansion and the simplification of research and experimentation has been --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this is all about politics and producing a law, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly get it through Congress and you know that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0But, Chip, Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to do after November. \xc2\xa0The President is putting on the table a series of what he believes are important economic ideas. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he do it a year ago or six months ago?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, if you look at the expensing provisions -- in 2008, the former administration had a 50 percent expensing provision in law. \xc2\xa0The Recovery Act contained a 50 percent expensing provision in 2009. \xc2\xa0In 2010, the small business bill that is before the Senate continues the 2009\xe2\x80\x99s 50 percent expensing threshold. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re saying that for 2011, we believe that 50 should go to 100. \xc2\xa0It builds off of an effort to get capital off the sidelines and into the economy. \xc2\xa0Some of this stuff is -- builds off of what has already been done. \xc2\xa0So the notion that these are somehow either pulled out of whole cloth for the first time I think is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not an accurate reading of any of the policy --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of McCain, he says that coming up with it now is just a sign that the administration is flailing around, looking for anything they can sell as an effort to get the economy moving.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think -- this is -- I guess in a sense, Chip, I want to separate -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the political season; we get that. \xc2\xa0This is -- these are not -- this is not simply something that the President is proposing to get us somehow through the next seven weeks of how we get our economy from where it is to where we want it to be. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The President, as I said a minute ago, is focused on the problems that the American people have -- the economic situation that we all find ourselves in. \xc2\xa0It may or may not overlap well with a political calendar. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what -- the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t here to solve the nation\xe2\x80\x99s problems on a political calendar. \xc2\xa0He is here to solve the nation\xe2\x80\x99s problems as they exist. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what he is elected to do and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll focus his time on doing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just quickly on the Koran story, have you heard the President comment on that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have not. \xc2\xa0I have not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President misspeak yesterday when he said the infrastructure improvements would create jobs immediately? \xc2\xa0About the same time, officials were saying on background it would be 2011 and maybe late 2011.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think some of that obviously depends on when something would pass. \xc2\xa0If you pass something in -- if you pass something in the next few months, I think you could certainly see jobs created for the summer construction season, yes -- or I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the spring construction season.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You just told Ed it\xe2\x80\x99s not a stimulus package. \xc2\xa0Does that mean it won\xe2\x80\x99t stimulate the economy?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think there are a series of things that would help put our economy on a stronger road to recovery. \xc2\xa0More importantly -- Savannah, you could dump whatever you wanted into the economy to get the economy to do certain things in a very short period of time. \xc2\xa0None of that, though, is going to -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take the infrastructure, for instance.The infrastructure is built off of what Congress will ultimately do as part of a six-year transportation reauthorization plan, partly because we know that one out of every five people that\xe2\x80\x99s unemployed used to spend time in the construction industry, back when we had fairly easy loans to buy a house, and back when millions of units of homes were being built annually. \xc2\xa0We now know that because of foreclosure, because of credit, because of the economy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a vast surplus in those homes.Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0These measures are designed to stimulate the economy, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0They are designed to continue our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve announced pay-fors for some of these proposals, notably the ones that would be permanent, but not all of them. \xc2\xa0And I wonder how that runs up against your discretionary spending freeze; how it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with your policy not to spend unless it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, obviously on, I think, on the call that Wendell was talking about, there was a discussion about closing tax cuts for oil and gas companies to pay for an increased amount of infrastructure spending, which would fall -- which would certainly fall in the non-security discretionary spending.Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just wondering how you decide, because some things you did identify pay-fors. \xc2\xa0Others you don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I think some things are designed to -- some things are designed as part of, as you said, a bucket of otherwise discretionary spending, and some are designed to -- for tax incentives that will take capital and money off the sidelines and put it into the economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess, in other words, you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to deficit-spend right now, notwithstanding this spending freeze.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, there are certainly proposals in here that would do that, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, and a quick one. \xc2\xa0On our poll, 58 percent believe that if the Republicans get control they will have different ideas than the Bush administration; 35 percent believe they\xe2\x80\x99ll fall back on Bush policies. \xc2\xa0It stands out because it seems like voters are directly rejecting the very argument that the President has been making forcefully for some months --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0They seem to be rejecting the very argument that the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 head -- both of the congressional committees made on NBC as well. \xc2\xa0I think Pete Sessions said very verbatim that \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to return to those policies.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That may be the case, but it seems voters don\xe2\x80\x99t know that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We will spend the next couple of months sharpening that argument, if need be, to ensure that people do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the Peter Orszag piece, he also, besides making an economic argument, made a political argument about extending the tax cuts for the upper-income bracket by saying that that may be the cost of a deal with Republicans. \xc2\xa0And he says that would be a tradeoff worth making. \xc2\xa0Do you think that would be a tradeoff worth making?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint is that we cannot afford to extend the tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s understand what that means. \xc2\xa0For most of these -- most of the spending for extending those tax cuts comes from -- almost all of it, the bulk of it comes from incomes that surpass a million dollars. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s roughly, for a millionaire, that\xe2\x80\x99s a $100,000 tax cut. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President believes that we are a $100,000 tax cut from a millionaire away from an economy that works for families that are making $40,000 a year.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is he ruling out signing legislation that would extend the tax cuts for that group?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, our viewpoint on this is that we should and must pass legislation that extends the tax cuts for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0But we cannot afford in this environment to -- in our budgetary and fiscal environment -- to extend the tax cuts for those that make more than $250,000 a year.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, therefore, you\xe2\x80\x99re ruling out -- are you ruling out that legislation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m simply stating what our position is.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why are you so dead set against using the term \xe2\x80\x9cstimulus,\xe2\x80\x9d especially for the public works component of this series of proposals? \xc2\xa0It very much resembles things that were in the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Some of them build off of what was in the Recovery Act. \xc2\xa0I do not think -- as I said last week, I do not think that this is anywhere near the level of what was enacted at the beginning of the administration.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also, Robert, you said a few minutes ago that the President wants to put on the table this series of economic ideas. \xc2\xa0How do you see the prospects for it getting off the table anytime soon?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think if you go back and look at, and as has been pointed out here, these seem to -- some of these ideas have some support. \xc2\xa0Look, at some point we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to stop playing politics and start getting about fixing the economy because that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American people. \xc2\xa0At some point, the other party will begin to do that. \xc2\xa0And we have a series of proposals for them to look at.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You talk about Peter\xe2\x80\x99s -- putting on a congressional relations hat. \xc2\xa0In terms of White House relations, did he give you guys a heads up at all that he was going to be writing on this subject?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0We certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Peter\xe2\x80\x99s column before it appeared today. \xc2\xa0I mean, obviously I think it was reported late last week that he was going to start writing a column, but --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but the substance, the grist of -- yes --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Nobody that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of saw the column before.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just -- sorry to belabor this point, but you just said the President is very -- deeply, deeply troubled. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, exactly. \xc2\xa0I can see the pain -- the smirk on your faces is -- seems to underscore the tremendous emotional pain with which I\xe2\x80\x99m now putting you through, huh?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we\xe2\x80\x99re having this moment.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we could do this together.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you want us to leave? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Extending -- extending -- you were just were very clear, the President does not believe extending -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not affordable to extend tax cuts for -- but I believe Orszag\xe2\x80\x99s point was it\xe2\x80\x99s not affordable to extend them for the middle class. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s his point. \xc2\xa0And if we can get your comments on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The President disagrees with that. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk about --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0See -- you didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem very pained at all. \xc2\xa0That was --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President disagrees with his former OMB director that extending the middle-class tax cuts are not something that we can afford?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Were these arguments he made when he was budget director?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will say this. \xc2\xa0I obviously was not in every meeting that Peter was in. \xc2\xa0I did not -- I did not hear him make this argument. \xc2\xa0He may have made this argument in some meetings. \xc2\xa0I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t recall it. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Ari.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk about what the President discussed this morning with Secretary Clinton and the NATO Secretary General?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, the Clinton meeting is part of their regular weekly meetings. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout on that, but we will have a readout on the NATO Secretary General a little bit later on. \xc2\xa0My guess is that most of that had to do with Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also, to what extent is tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s speech a direct response to Congressman Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s speech on the economy in Ohio a couple of weeks ago?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- it\xe2\x80\x99s in the same city and I think the President will use that opportunity to contrast a vision of returning to a decade of policy and value decisions that got us into this mess, which if you look back at what Congressman Boehner said in that speech, he seemed to lay out a strong predicate for the very same type of decisions that had been made over the past 10 years that got us into this mess. \xc2\xa0I anticipate the President will spend a decent amount of time discussing it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the venue, a community college versus the City Club?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That I -- look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s in this case Cleveland and Cleveland.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you choose Cleveland because Boehner had given his speech there?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put you through the same emotional racking that I just put Hans through. \xc2\xa0So I just figured \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d was probably an easier answer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, can I ask you about the Oval Office rug and the quotation that you folks attributed to Martin Luther King?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- well, just to be fair, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He said it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I was going to say. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s -- well, I think we should stipulate for history that it was not us that thought he said it. \xc2\xa0It was many people that believed, I think rightly so, that he said that.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He did say it on more than one occasion.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been pointed out that Dr. King himself often pointed to the fact that these were the words of Dr. Theodore Parker, an abolitionist. \xc2\xa0Is Parker -- was the President aware of these antecedents?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have not -- Mark, I have -- we have not covered the rug today in our discussions. \xc2\xa0I would say this. \xc2\xa0I read some of the back-and-forth on this. \xc2\xa0I read the column in the Post, which we certainly all learn a lot of important history on.</p>\n<p>Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point out that I think what King said and what Parker said are not the same thing. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s on the rug is what Dr. King had said.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President or does the White House not believe that Parker should get some credit for --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, nobody gets credit on the rug. \xc2\xa0I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the quotes. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- and Mark, I have to say, if I see you in there writing on the rug, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in a lot of trouble. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- I want to get that sort of out before --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The names aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the rug, but the names aren\xe2\x80\x99t on --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just around the edges.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, today Charlie Cook joins other analysts in forecasting that estimated the Republicans could gain over 40 seats and very possibly substantially more. \xc2\xa0Do you see that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That certainly hedges your bets. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, 40, do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Forty or more.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you see a political landscape right now where the Republicans --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take business away from Charlie or Stu or others by making a lot of predictions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think I said a few weeks ago that I thought Democrats would retain the House and the Senate. \xc2\xa0I still believe that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Oh, yesterday, when the President ad-libbed that his critics talk about him like a dog, what was he -- what did he mean?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have not talked to him about that, but I assume that if you look at some of what is said about the President and matched them up against the facts, on occasion dogs get a better representation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who was the \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d that he was referring to?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s probably -- we could probably find you several hundred thousand quotes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, I was looking forward to the U.N. General Assembly meeting in a couple of weeks, and I was refreshing my memory on what the President said last year. \xc2\xa0One of the things he said to the Assembly is that he was -- one of his goals was to reduce the skepticism and distrust of the U.S. abroad. \xc2\xa0Have you -- what do you think? \xc2\xa0Have you talked about this with him lately? \xc2\xa0Does he think that that is --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I have not. \xc2\xa0I can certainly see if some of the national security folks have. \xc2\xa0Look, I think that -- I think the -- if you look at where the views of those across the world have of this country now, and how they thought of it when the President came into office, I think we have seen an improvement in world opinion.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that the removal of skepticism and distrust in world opinion is not a means or an ends to itself, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an end, it\xe2\x80\x99s a means. \xc2\xa0And that is we -- it helps our ability to bring along those on a world stage to do things that are important to increase the security of people throughout the world.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think if you -- look, this certainly -- this action predates what the President said last September, but starting with North Korean sanctions, extending to sanctions on Iran. \xc2\xa0I think there are a whole host of things -- an additional START treaty pending before the Senate to cut the threat of nuclear weapons in this age -- all are a result of better relationships that we have with other countries.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you -- looking forward to the meeting coming up, is there any particular focus that you can highlight, or something the President is asking for?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You know, I have not spent a lot of time on what the program looks like yet, but as we get closer, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Glenn.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, the President was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. \xc2\xa0He had a lot of economic struggle when he was a kid. \xc2\xa0Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he talk about that more when he\xe2\x80\x99s out?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think he talked a little bit about it yesterday and I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it a little bit more on Wednesday. \xc2\xa0It obviously was part of what he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about for many years. \xc2\xa0I have not looked back at all his speeches about whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of what he talked about or how much that has changed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think a lot of his speeches have tended to walk people through their -- likely what they\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing in their lives, vice what has happened in his.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting distinction because Presidents who have been pretty successful at making these arguments before -- looking at President Clinton, even President -- second President Bush, to some degree, have certainly talked about their personal experience. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a way of sort of making those points. \xc2\xa0Do you think he needs to do a good deal more of that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, as I said, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear some of that tomorrow. \xc2\xa0I think you heard some of it yesterday. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good part of what -- the type of decisions and the type of values that lead to the decisions that he makes as part of our economic recovery. \xc2\xa0So I do anticipate you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more of it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, following up on Jake -- on his question about Orszag, was Peter Orszag someone here who was known as a dissenting voice, somewhat -- to push back on proposals periodically? \xc2\xa0Or was he someone who just pretty much followed through on giving the President ideas or implementing things that the President wanted? \xc2\xa0What was he, or was he a mixture of both?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0April, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to generalize about anybody here. \xc2\xa0I mean, look, I think probably like a number of people that work here -- and if you walked into any meeting, people have opinions that may or may not vary with those that are in the room.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 This is a longer way of saying I think it would be hard to put just anybody in a box, for two years of service, in one neat box so quickly.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So would you at least say that he did maybe push back on some economic issues, maybe give other ideas a twist or turns? \xc2\xa0Because, I mean, he made a persuasive argument in this story that he wrote about a nation, two deficits and how to come out of that.</p>\n<p>So, I mean, you were saying about Congress -- he was trying to make the point about Congress, but he made a persuasive argument bringing facts to what he said. \xc2\xa0So did he bring something to the table -- people talking about that morning, that he brought that to the table, to the President --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sort of hearing your question. \xc2\xa0Look, I think Peter has, again, depending on the issue, depending on -- has had varying opinions on what to do when and how best to execute it. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true for a whole host of different policies.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right, and also on the issue of Cleveland. \xc2\xa0There are some in Cleveland, in actually the city proper of Cleveland, who are concerned, saying that Cleveland is a prime example of a city who can benefit from any kind of stimulus package. \xc2\xa0And the President continues to go on the outskirts of Cleveland. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the city has a 20 percent unemployment rate, 17,000 vacant homes. \xc2\xa0And Wednesday, the President goes to a place called Parma on the outskirts. \xc2\xa0And before he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m getting it right, Stoneysville or something like that before, on the outskirts of Cleveland. \xc2\xa0And why not go into Cleveland proper?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0You know, April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the -- look, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- what you talk about in Parma doesn\xe2\x80\x99t also mean -- look -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out the best way to say this. \xc2\xa0Look, I think if -- what the President is talking about is companies that are in Cleveland proper or around Cleveland, these tax cuts would help them -- infrastructure spending, building new roads and bridges and runways is going to help -- it\xe2\x80\x99s going to help everybody.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a suburban economic speech or an urban economic speech, because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the President and the team have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ve dissected this quite down to that level in terms of the types of things that we need and the types of problems that we face.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, just two questions. \xc2\xa0Two Washington Post editorials were headlined, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Scourge of Rape In Prisons\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cA Tolerance of Rape,\xe2\x80\x9d and they ask why has the Justice Department dithered for a year? \xc2\xa0And could you tell us, because the President does care about this, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily read what you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, Lester.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The two editorials in The Washington Post and I have them right here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, you should -- if they reference the Department of Justice, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a pretty good place to start.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that any of us would talk about you like a dog, do you?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Can I get back to you on that, Lester? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m simply -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going through those same sort of tortured soul that I can only imagine Hans was going through in asking his questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Stephen.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0BP is going to release its report tomorrow into the causes of the oil spill. \xc2\xa0Has the White House had an advance look at this? \xc2\xa0And secondly, given the past relationship between the administration and the company, what level of confidence do you have that this is going to produce a genuine finding into what caused the accident?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this. \xc2\xa0I know of no one that has seen it here. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen emails alluding to the notion that -- and clips alluding to the notion that this is -- this will be released. \xc2\xa0Obviously I think we\xe2\x80\x99d want a chance to look at the report. \xc2\xa0I think an important partner of that investigation, Stephen, ultimately is going to get -- is going to be a look at the blowout preventer itself, which only recently, in the last few days, has been brought to the surface, and will give us a chance to see whether was this a design flaw, was this something that was just a problem that this blowout preventer had to deal with, and a whole host of things.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly look through the report. \xc2\xa0Obviously -- look through the report and may have some comment about it. \xc2\xa0But I do not know of anybody who has seen an advance copy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Robert. \xc2\xa0About Secretary General Rasmussen\xe2\x80\x99s visit, is the President worried with NATO and actually diminishing role in Afghanistan, this becoming a heavier burden on U.S. soldiers on the ground there? \xc2\xa0And secondly, has General Petraeus expressed or requested more NATO involvement in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the second part. \xc2\xa0Look, as part of what the President announced last December at West Point, NATO contributed an increase in forces on the ground in Afghanistan, a contribution that I know commanders at the time at ISAF believed would play a crucial role in our overall strategy. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Obviously this is not -- the problems that we face with -- in Afghanistan and in Pakistan dealing with al Qaeda and its extremist allies, their potential return, an environment that allows, if they were to return, unfettered planning for an additional terrorist attack -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s simply in the interest of the United States in preventing. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s of international concern. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why there is an international security assistance force there. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly -- I know that the commanders -- our commanders are thankful for that involvement.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But does the President feel that the NATO leaders are not conscious enough of the general danger for themselves of a --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0How so?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- of a terrorist --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, no, look, I think if you look at -- if you -- look, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that. \xc2\xa0I think if you look at what has happened over the past couple years in places -- past few years, not just a couple, but past few years in places like England and Spain, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you could make a very eloquent point that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t those in the NATO alliance that haven\xe2\x80\x99t also experienced the type of terrorism -- certainly, maybe not quite on the scale of 9/11, but certainly they\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly been immune to it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s been growing alarm in the judicial community about the vacancies at some of these federal courts. \xc2\xa0Forty-seven vacancies have been labeled \xe2\x80\x9cemergencies\xe2\x80\x9d by the judiciary because of heavy caseloads. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot from the lectern about GOP obstructionism on this front, but what is the White House going to do differently, either with the remaining time in the recess, perhaps, or afterwards to actually get people appointed --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, Sam, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the statistics in front of me. \xc2\xa0I think obviously we have sent up a comparable number of judicial appointments up to the Senate. \xc2\xa0As you mentioned and as I have mentioned on many occasions, we have seen a lack of any sort of cooperation in moving a number of these nominees along.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And look, every President and Congress of differing parties is going to have some fights about this, but there are -- there continue to be an absurd number of judges that have passed -- and again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the stats in front of me, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get them -- that have passed unanimously out of committee that need to be considered quickly by Congress. \xc2\xa0It just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense if there\xe2\x80\x99s -- that we can\xe2\x80\x99t move a judicial nominee through the process if they have received a unanimous endorsement from the committee that is most tasked with looking at these judicial appointments.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We just had this recess, though, and there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a recess appointment, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned -- or as far as I know, of any of these nominees. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if we should expect something in the week ahead, or why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you taken advantage of the recess appointment?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t look into my crystal ball to tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s ahead.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, can I ask a question on economic strategy?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Someone is -- a Brookings Institution senior fellow William Gale about a month ago said that whether you can afford it or not, the only politically feasible thing to do is to have at least a one- or two-year extension of 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. \xc2\xa0Now, can you afford not to do that if you hope to address long-term business uncertainty -- which I believe is what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do with your --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, some things are designed to address, as I said earlier, money that may be on the sidelines that isn\xe2\x80\x99t being used for investment, for research, or for expansion. \xc2\xa0But, look, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that anybody at the Brookings Institute would tell you, from an economic standpoint, that the best way to address business uncertainty is by extending a tax cut for somebody that makes a million dollars a year. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that. \xc2\xa0He said if you want to get anything through, politically feasibly, the only way politically feasibly getting anything through would be to do it in order to get what you want to get through, which is business uncertainty and addressing --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, maybe I agree some with what -- I said I thought that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- the argument that Peter was actually trying to make in the newspaper today was, again, a political and a congressional relations argument, not an economic argument.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but at his swan song, Orszag did say you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a 10-year extension of all the 2001, 2003 tax cuts, because that would cost $700 billion.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0That $700 billion is a 10-year extension of the upper-end tax cuts, not the 2001, 2003 middle-class tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Thank you guys. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rtecenter">END \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa01:04 P.M.
