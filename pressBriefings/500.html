Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:15 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I just wanted to congratulate on behalf of the President and everyone here at the White House Meb Keflezighi, who just won the Boston Marathon -- first American to do so in 31 years, which is quite an accomplishment and a great year to do it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pretty cool.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well done.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s absolutely true.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s all I have at the top, so I\'ll go to Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine and Russia are trading blame over who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the shooting yesterday in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Can you just give us what the U.S. assessment is of what happened there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, what I can tell you is that we continue to monitor events in eastern Ukraine closely.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen differing reports about what happened in Slovyansk yesterday but cannot independently confirm responsibility for these actions.\xc2\xa0 Overall, we are concerned about the situation there, and we urge paramilitary groups throughout the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine to lay down their weapons and depart the buildings that they have occupied, as was called for in the accord signed in Geneva last week.\xc2\xa0 We continue to call on Russia to use its influence over these groups to press them to disarm and to turn occupied buildings over to the authorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We commend the government of Ukraine for continuing to demonstrate restraint, and are hopeful that all parties in the Rada will shortly be able to agree on an amnesty bill to help deescalate the situation in the east.\xc2\xa0 As we have said, if there is not progress within days we remain prepared, along with our European and G7 partners, to impose additional costs on Russia for its destabilizing actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So when it comes to that specific incident, we\'re still unable independently to confirm who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for what happened there, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a great deal of destabilizing activity and that Russia has influence over the groups that have engaged in that activity, who have seized buildings.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to call on Russia to use that influence to pressure those groups to disarm and to return the buildings to authorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned a couple of steps that you commend Ukraine for taking in order to live up to the conditions of this accord.\xc2\xa0 But do you have any indication that Russia is taking the steps that it agreed to under that agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, they signed the agreement and they have committed themselves by signing to use their influence to stabilize the situation in Ukraine or to urge those over whom they have influence to disarm and to return buildings that they have occupied back to the authorities.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to press them to do that.\xc2\xa0 As we have made clear, should Russia continue to engage in destabilizing actions in Ukraine, there will be costs.\xc2\xa0 There has been already.\xc2\xa0 And should they escalate their destabilizing activity the costs will escalate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'re in a place now with the Vice President in Kyiv and meeting with Ukrainian government officials where we are demonstrating our support for that government, for the process that they have undertaken of both reform and near-term elections, and we are continuing to call on all parties to honor the agreements they made in Geneva.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point, do you see any sign that Russia is doing that, is honoring the agreement they made?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we continue to see is a situation in eastern Ukraine that remains very volatile and tense and that requires that steps be taken to stabilize it because of the potential for it to become worse and more chaotic.\xc2\xa0 What we hope to see from Russia is the use of its influence on those groups that clearly respond to that influence.\xc2\xa0 And we have been very clear that we firmly believe that Russia has supported the so-called separatists in eastern Ukraine that have popped up with arms to seize buildings, to stockpile weapons, to erect roadblocks.\xc2\xa0 And Russia needs to abide by the agreement signed in Geneva and to take steps to help stabilize the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just be any more specific about this coming days timeline?\xc2\xa0 Officials have been using that since Thursday when this agreement was signed and we\xe2\x80\x99re now at Monday.\xc2\xa0 How much longer do you let this play out without seeing some kind of concrete sign that it\xe2\x80\x99s holding and that progress is being made?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an end date for you.\xc2\xa0 We are in a situation where we have potential new sanctions that we could impose, as we mentioned last week, and we are closely monitoring events in eastern Ukraine and monitoring compliance with the agreement signed in Geneva, and we will be evaluating compliance in coming days.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What role did the White House play either in the timing or the substance of Friday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on Keystone?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Keystone process is run out of the State Department, in keeping with past practice by administrations of both parties going back many decades -- or much time.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it -- and for details you need to go to the State Department -- the issue here has to do with a court decision in Nebraska and its impact on the ability for the state process to continue, for agencies to be able to comment.\xc2\xa0 And absent a definite route through Nebraska, the decision, as I understand, by State is that that can\xe2\x80\x99t continue until the situation in Nebraska is resolved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President frustrated at all at these delays, this indefiniteness in the process?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President wants the process to be conducted in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with past practice and consistent with the interests that have to be examined when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an international border being crossed by a pipeline.\xc2\xa0 There have been a series of moments along the path here where politics has played a role in delaying the process, as you know -- actions that Congress took, for example.\xc2\xa0 And then there have been other instances where either local or state concerns slow down the process, or, in this case, action by a state court had an impact on the process itself.</p>\n<p>What the President has insisted on all along is that this process be run out of the State Department in accordance with established tradition for matters like these, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been the case here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So politics is not playing a role in this current delay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a State Department process, it\xe2\x80\x99s a State Department decision, so I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Ukraine, you talked earlier about Russian support for these separatists who are occupying buildings and then these towns.\xc2\xa0 What about evidence that they might actually be Russian? We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that Ukraine gave the OSCE photographs -- photographic evidence, they say, of actual Russians who participated in earlier events in Crimea or even Chechnya.\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. seen these pictures, validated them?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the response to these photos, which certainly suggest they\xe2\x80\x99re not just supporting the separatists but --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s been broad consensus in the international community about the connection between Russia and the armed militants in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And the photographs that you referred to that Ukraine has submitted to the OSCE I think reaffirm that connection.\xc2\xa0 We have noted in the past reporting that -- public reporting that indicates Russian personnel being involved in some of the activity.\xc2\xa0 The actions of the militants bear striking similarities to actions taken in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 And I think President Putin himself noted the other day that Russia -- not just to separatists -- but Russia itself participated in that.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any doubt about the connection there, and I think that the photographs that are reported on today simply reaffirm that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Russia then becomes -- if the separatists are still occupying these buildings and there\xe2\x80\x99s no marked change since this truce, this accord, are the Russians -- do you guys believe that the Russians are negotiating in good faith?\xc2\xa0 It has to be about negotiations and not a military solution, so if the Russians are not just supporting separatists but separatists may be Russian, how are you approaching the Russians on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very direct with Russia and that was the case in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 Russia understands that the international community holds one view about the actions that Russia has taken and supported in Ukraine, and that we stand prepared, together with our partners, to impose further costs on Russia if Russia does not take action to help stabilize the situation in Ukraine and to cease promoting destabilizing activity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in the coming days, if Russia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t abide by the commitments it\xe2\x80\x99s made and we don\xe2\x80\x99t see steps taken to reduce the instability in the region, steps taken to use the influence that Russia has on the militants to get them to disarm and to turn back over the buildings that they\xe2\x80\x99ve seized, then we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to impose further costs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on Yemen, do you know a sense of timing on how long it will take before you\xe2\x80\x99ll know if the bomb-maker, al Asiri, was killed in these strikes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the reports and I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Yemeni government and what the government itself has said.\xc2\xa0 In statements to the press, the Yemeni government has confirmed that air strikes were carried out these weekend against al Qaeda militants in remote training camps and in a convoy.\xc2\xa0 According to the Yemenis, these individuals were planning to target civilian and military facilities in al-Bayda and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to specific operations, but we have a strong, collaborative relationship, as you know, with the Yemeni government and work together on various initiatives to counter the shared threat we face from AQAP.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of more details about the strikes that the Yemeni government has discussed, I would refer you to the Yemeni government.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, you keep saying that you need to see evidence of Russia not fulfilling its promises and what was agreed to.\xc2\xa0 All there has been rhetorically is just the opposite. It\xe2\x80\x99s been Putin saying he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even understand why parts of Ukraine were even handed over in the first place.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s been very provocative.\xc2\xa0 If anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reescalating not deescalating.\xc2\xa0 So I guess what is the \xe2\x80\x9cokay, enough\xe2\x80\x9d as of now?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you waiting for?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the cutoff line here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific deadline for you except to say that the agreement was signed in Geneva; we are closely monitoring events in eastern Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this days?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The situation in coming days, you can expect that we will move forward with the imposition of further costs on Russia if Russia does not take action to comply with its commitments in Geneva.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the action that you guys are waiting for -- pulling troops back?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To see that there are actions taken that help stabilize the situation.\xc2\xa0 And that would mean militias -- armed militias disarming, removing themselves from buildings that they have seized and occupied.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The other side of the story, which is very important, the Ukrainian government, again, showing great restraint and professionalism, is taking steps that it can to help reduce tensions and deescalate, and that includes actions in the Rada to offer amnesty to those who have participated in these actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By saying what you just said, this means that Lavrov\xe2\x80\x99s claim that somehow this was -- that the Ukrainian government was behind this recent incident is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\'t have -- as I said regarding the incident in Slovyansk, we don\'t have independent confirmation of exactly what transpired there.\xc2\xa0 But broadly speaking, we have seen obviously a great deal of activity seemingly coordinated -- almost indisputably coordinated in eastern Ukraine when it comes to armed groups seizing buildings, occupying them, declaring themselves autonomous or independent and then absolutely in violation of Ukrainian law and constitution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some -- moving to the announcement today at the Justice Department about the expanded potential executive -- of what applications for clemency to the President\xc2\xa0 -- that make it to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk -- can you fill in some of the gaps of some of the criteria that is going to be included in that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, probably the gaps would best be filled over at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, as we\'ve said before, the President wants to make sure that everyone has a fair shot under the clemency system, and he has asked the Department of Justice to set up a process aimed at ensuring that anyone who has a good case for commutation has their application seen and evaluated thoroughly.</p>\n<p>The number of commutations that are granted will depend entirely on the number of worthy candidates.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of how many deserving candidates are out there, I couldn\'t begin to speculate.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place that reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that everyone should have a fair shot under the system for consideration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Under this same thing, is there any -- does the President want a process to reconsider the classification of marijuana?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our views on that have not changed and I don\'t think this is a related --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no ongoing effort to change it from being a Schedule 1 controlled substance?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would have an impact on how many -- this does have some impact on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For details you should go to DOJ.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to venture too far out here because I\'m not a lawyer or an expert in this, but this has to do with the Fair Sentencing Act the President signed into law in 2010 and the observation that the President has made, and others of both parties have made, about the inconsistency between current law and sentences that many are serving now.\xc2\xa0 And the President simply wants a process by which everyone who might potentially have clemency available to him or her get the consideration that they deserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any interest in -- does the administration want the Justice Department to look into reclassifying marijuana?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything new on that issue since the last time we talked about it.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Keystone decision.\xc2\xa0 It\'s obviously a decision that has big political ramifications.\xc2\xa0 Was there any communication between the White House and the State Department before the State Department moved forward and decided to delay the decision?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a process run out of State.\xc2\xa0 State has made an announcement related to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking if they talked to State before --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the Nebraska court decision.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any conversations that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 This process is run out of State and this is in reaction to, as I understand it, a Nebraska Supreme Court decision which could ultimately affect the pipeline in that state -- the pipeline route.\xc2\xa0 And again, they have the details and the expertise over at State in the running of this process, but it stands to reason that if you\'re in the middle of a process by which agencies -- and you\'re at the stage where agencies are supposed to comment on a pipeline route and that route itself may be in doubt because of a state Supreme Court decision, it stands to reason that more time is needed for that to be resolved before the process at State can be concluded.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is happy with the decision the State Department took?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a great urge, and has always been, to make this about politics, but we\'ve seen along this process -- along the way here, along the route, a series of actions taken in keeping with past practice where the reviews are done out of the State Department.\xc2\xa0 We are at a process where agencies were able to weigh in and then we have a state Supreme Court decision.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has more details or can brief you more fully on it, but that obviously has a potential impact on the pipeline route, and therefore, the decision that the State Department made was made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any power in this area?\xc2\xa0 Could he overrule the State Department?\xc2\xa0 Could he tell them to speed this up?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any personal views on this?\xc2\xa0 Is he glad to see it pushed until after the elections, or would he like to see this thing finally resolved?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s had the answer I think -- the questions on this for years now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been consistent in always wanting the process to be conducted on the merits and in keeping with past practices of administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen attempts to inject politics into this, actions by Congress, for example, that have actually served to delay the normal process that the State Department runs, again, in administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So obviously nobody, as I understand it, at the State Department or here could anticipate the Nebraska Supreme Court decision.\xc2\xa0 That decision was made; there\xe2\x80\x99s an assessment made by those who are running the process that it could have an impact on the pipeline route, so State Department made the decision that it made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he have the power --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he have the power?\xc2\xa0 I mean, could he call the State Department and say --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to State for how the process works.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously his administration, but his interest is not in ruling by fiat, but for letting the process be properly managed and completed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then can I get you just to respond -- obviously there have been some Democrats who are I guess furious about this delay.\xc2\xa0 Senator Begich of Alaska said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am, frankly, appalled at the continued foot-dragging.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Mary Landrieu said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis decision is irresponsible, unnecessary, and unacceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, said it is absolutely ridiculous that it has been delayed yet again.\xc2\xa0 Your response to these Democratic senators?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My response to any questions about this or statements about this is that it is a process run by the State Department, as has been the case in previous administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0 There was a decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court -- not here in Washington, but by the Nebraska Supreme Court -- that affects potentially the pipeline route, and the State Department that\xe2\x80\x99s running the process has made a decision about the impact of that decision on the process itself.\xc2\xa0 So I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d refer these senators to the State Department?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, those are just the facts, Jon.\xc2\xa0 The process has to be compliant with past practice.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you said earlier that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to -- this administration hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to independently verify all the facts of what happened this weekend, but do you know enough to say that there is nothing that you know so far that would justify Russian forces coming in to protect Russians in Ukraine, as some in the areas where this violence occurred have asked for?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That would be, as a general matter, significant and dangerous escalation of the situation.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that that kind of action, direct military intervention by Russia in Ukraine, in eastern Ukraine, would be a serious escalation of the situation there and would be met with a serious escalation of the cost to Russia.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s our view on that as a general matter and a specific matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re still assessing the events of the weekend, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the overall situation has been greatly worsened by the intervention of armed militants who have seized buildings, stockpiled weapons, blockaded roads, and done so in the name of either joining Russia or being independent and being generally pro-Russia.\xc2\xa0 And our whole position has always been that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s future has to be for Ukraine to decide and it should not be dictated to by outside states -- in this case, Russia.\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian parliament and government --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- use it as a pretext to expand Russian action inside Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to how it might be viewed in Moscow, but that is, of course, a very serious concern as a general matter, that pretext of the kind that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, some of them fairly blatant and transparent, only serve to further destabilize the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said a moment ago when asked what has Russia done to comply with the agreement, you said, well, they signed it.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that it was signed knowing full well that the separatists or the provocateurs or whatever you want to call them inside of Ukraine would say, well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the Ukrainian government in the first place, therefore, it\xe2\x80\x99s not binding, therefore, signing it had no practical effect for the very government you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping will help enforce it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, people -- they might have rationales for why they act, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- such action wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be lawful in Ukraine under the Ukrainian constitution, under Ukrainian law.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, intervention by another state in violation of a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity would be a transgression of international law, as we saw in Crimea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are all sorts of unsustainable rationales for why these kinds of things are done and some of them are just pure propaganda.\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen out of the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian parliament are steps that have been designed to demonstrate restraint and demonstrate a resolve to work with those regions of Ukraine that may want greater autonomy.\xc2\xa0 And the Ukrainian government has committed itself to a process of constitutional reform.\xc2\xa0 There are national elections scheduled for May 25th and the Rada itself has moved along in a process that could result in the passage of legislation that would allow for amnesty to participants in this activity.\xc2\xa0 So I think, again, what you have seen on the Ukrainian side of this is a series of steps clearly designed to deescalate the situation, and we have not yet seen that from the other side.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said a moment ago, in the coming days the cost might go up for the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 Would it be reasonable to interpret that as by Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put a timeline on it, Major.\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that we will assess Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions in keeping with the commitments it made in Geneva and then evaluate those actions, and in coming days make a decision about whether or not further costs will be imposed because of Russian actions that destabilize Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The State Department said they\xe2\x80\x99ve been investigating a chemical weapons attack in Syria, a new one.\xc2\xa0 How serious is this situation and how does it affect ongoing administration policy here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month in the opposition-dominated village of Kfar Zeita.\xc2\xa0 We are examining allegations that the government was responsible.\xc2\xa0 We take all allegations of the use of chemicals in combat very seriously and we are working to determine what happened.\xc2\xa0 We will continue consulting and sharing information with key partners, including, of course, at the OPCW.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a matter that\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to determine what happened.\xc2\xa0 And once that has been established, we can talk about what reaction, if any, or response, if any, there would be from the international community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it tell you in the context of what the administration has touted has been general success of getting the Syrians to dismantle --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Indications of use -- we are still establishing what happened and who was responsible.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re examining allegations that the regime was responsible.\xc2\xa0 We continue the process with our partners that Syria committed to -- the Assad regime as well as Russia committed to that has led now to more than 65 percent of the Syrian regime\xe2\x80\x99s stockpiles of chemical weapons being removed for destruction, and that process continues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple of minutes ago you said in the coming days you can expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll move forward to impose higher costs on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And then just to Major, you said we\xe2\x80\x99re going to evaluate whether or not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry, the second -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a transcript of what I said.\xc2\xa0 We will make a decision about --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99re going to impose the costs?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, depending on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but -- okay, so you haven\xe2\x80\x99t decided.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I was pretty clear about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounded pretty definitive before that you were going to impose higher costs.\xc2\xa0 Now you haven\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet whether you\xe2\x80\x99re going to?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have an agreement that was signed by Russia, that committed Russia to take steps to help stabilize the situation in Ukraine, and that includes using its influence on these armed militias -- militants, rather, to disarm and to return buildings that they\xe2\x80\x99ve occupied back to the authorities in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So we are evaluating the application -- or implementation of the commitments made in Geneva, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll take steps in coming days as dictated by compliance with those agreements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like higher costs or further sanctions are ready to go if you decide the Russians haven\xe2\x80\x99t complied.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If progress is not made in coming days, we will impose further costs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are these further costs by economic sector or are they more individuals?\xc2\xa0 Or could you describe what they would be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to foreshadow -- as I think Ambassador Rice said on Friday, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to foreshadow specific sanctions that are under consideration, or individuals or entities that might be under consideration.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that the three executive orders that the President signed give him and the administration broad flexibility in the imposition of sanctions and the ability to escalate costs in response to escalation by Russia or other individuals and entities that violate Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n<p>So I think the way to look at this is that the response by the United States and our partners will depend upon the degree of escalation by those violating Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 So if there is no progress made on the commitments reached in Geneva in coming days, we will impose further costs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But one of the -- part of the things to factor is how willing Europe, in particular, even more than the U.S., is willing to pay a price of its own, because these sanctions are not without some kind of a blowback.\xc2\xa0 How confident are you that European allies are willing to shoulder the burden of the effect of further sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, Mara, is a great deal of consensus and unanimity among European nations and the United States and others in how we view the action that Russia has taken in Ukraine, in condemning it and in calling for steps to deescalate the situation there, and also to impose cost, as as the EU and separate European nations have done, as has the United States.</p>\n<p>Leaders of various partners in Europe have spoken to the very question that you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked and made clear that there have to be costs that will be imposed on Russia should Russia choose to escalate.\xc2\xa0 And we will work in concert with our European partners and allies and our G7 partners to do just that, as appropriate, depending on the degree to which progress is made or not made in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The decision to offer expanded clemency criteria for non-violent drug users, was this discussed between Justice and the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, the President wants to make sure that everyone has a fair shot under the clemency system.\xc2\xa0 He has asked the Department of Justice to set up a process aimed at ensuring that anyone who has a good case for commutation has their application seen and evaluated thoroughly.\xc2\xa0 In terms of how many deserving applications are out there, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin to speculate, but there is a process in place that ensures -- or that hopefully will ensure that everyone has a fair shot under the system.</p>\n<p>The President continues to believe that a resolution is needed for the many offenders who are serving unfairly long sentences under outdated guidelines, and that the clemency process is not an appropriate vehicle to address that injustice in a comprehensive way.\xc2\xa0 That should be done through bipartisan legislation like the measures currently working their way through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, this is an issue on which there is a bipartisan coalition that believes action needs to be taken and there are measures in Congress that reflect that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The use of chemical weapons apparent, possible use of chemical weapons in Syria -- is this an indication that the President has been unable, basically, to get the Assad regime to keep from going over this red line he drew?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Wendell, we have indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month in an opposition-dominated village.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re examining allegations that the government was responsible and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to determine what exactly happened.</p>\n<p>As you know, the United States and other nations are participants in an agreement that commits the Assad regime to relinquishing its stockpiles of chemical weapons and relinquishing them for destruction.\xc2\xa0 And that process continues, and we\xe2\x80\x99re now, I believe, at roughly 65, 67 percent of those weapons being turned over for destruction.\xc2\xa0 But this specific incident is obviously, as a general matter, something that is of concern and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re investigating what happened and allegations of who is responsible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the action in Yemen -- what does this say to the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated desire to actually reduce the use of drones?\xc2\xa0 And can we presume that this group pose a new threat to the U.S. and its allies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer that in a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to specific operations, as you know. But we have a strong collaborative relationship with the Yemeni government and work together on various initiatives to counter the shared threat we face from AQAP.\xc2\xa0 We support the Yemeni government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to tackle terrorism within their own borders; and beyond that, for details of these reported incidents, I would refer you to the Yemeni government.</p>\n<p>Again, without speaking about specific operations, I can tell you that in May 2013, President Obama spoke at length about the policy and legal rationale for how the United States takes direct action against al Qaeda and its associated forces outside of areas of active hostilities, including with drone strikes.\xc2\xa0 And as the President made clear, we take extraordinary care to make sure that our counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable domestic and international laws, and that they are consistent with U.S. values and policy.</p>\n<p>Mr. Knoller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there something that prompted President Obama to think that the applications for commutation of sentence were not getting due consideration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are issues that the President and his administration have been working on for a long time.\xc2\xa0 In 2010, Mark, as you know, the President pushed for and signed the Fair Sentencing Act to reduce disparities that punished crack cocaine offenses far more harshly than powder cocaine offenses.\xc2\xa0 And since taking office, the administration has supported criminal justice reform at the state and local level.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Last summer, the Attorney General announced a series of changes to enforce our drug laws more fairly, effectively, and efficiently.\xc2\xa0 And last December, President Obama commuted the sentences of eight individuals who are serving unduly harsh sentences issued under an outdated sentencing regime.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s basically a chronology that answers your question -- that this is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place and of interest to the administration and the President since the beginning, and reflected in the signing of the law in 2010 and the actions that he has taken since.</p>\n<p>So making sure that everyone has a fair shot under the clemency system is what\xe2\x80\x99s behind his request to the Justice Department that they set up a process aimed at making sure that anyone who has a good case gets consideration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he satisfied with the recommendations he gets from the pardon attorney on both commutation and pardons?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him, but the process works in the way that it has and I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly not heard a suggestion that the process doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work appropriately.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Biden is over in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be offering a package of technical assistance.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe a little bit what that\xe2\x80\x99s about, what that means, and would it include people from the Defense Department?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roger, what I can tell you is that the Vice President is in Ukraine to demonstrate our solidarity with the Ukrainian people and to discuss how the U.S. can support the international community\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to stabilize and strengthen Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s economy and assist Ukraine in moving forward on constitutional reform, decentralization, anticorruption efforts, and free and fair presidential elections on May 25th.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also be consulting on the latest developments in eastern Ukraine and on steps to enhance Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s short- and long-term energy security.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce ahead of the Vice President in terms of specific assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeking to provide Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we have taken steps already to assist Ukraine through a package of loan guarantees passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with our partners on the IMF to ensure that assistance is provided to Ukraine as they seek to stabilize their economy in this very difficult time.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of coordination will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say how many people it might be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think I would wait for the Vice President to speak about his meetings and any assistance he might be offering.</p>\n<p>Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the Vice President have any special message to deliver to the people from Belarus or Moldova as well as the Baltic countries while he is there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s there, principally, Jon-Christopher, to demonstrate the United States\xe2\x80\x99 support for Ukraine in all the ways that I just described.\xc2\xa0 We have also made clear because of the events in Ukraine that we strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent nations.\xc2\xa0 In addition to that, we have taken steps with our NATO partners to reassure NATO allies, like Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, who are NATO allies. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the actions that we have taken as an alliance to demonstrate that reassurance both in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as we well as in Poland.\xc2\xa0 And that process continues.</p>\n<p>So I think that there are slightly different answers to the questions that you asked.\xc2\xa0 But as a general principle, I think that this whole situation in Ukraine has demonstrated the world\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to sovereign nations\xe2\x80\x99 territorial integrity, and that there are costs that will be imposed on nations that violate the territorial integrity of another nation, another sovereign nation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s media are counting reports of increased activity at the North\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear test site.\xc2\xa0 Have we seen that?\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern here perhaps that North Korea is maybe doing something -- planning something and maybe even while the President is in the South later this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on those reports.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we monitor that kind of activity very closely, and we note a pattern of provocative actions from the regime in the DPRK that has been consistent unfortunately for many years.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on those reports.</p>\n<p>We obviously look forward to -- the President does -- his visit to Seoul, where the alliance that we share will be reaffirmed once again.\xc2\xa0 And the importance of that relationship will be reaffirmed while the President is there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, a very senior Pakistani journalist was shot at while he was coming from the airport.\xc2\xa0 Of late, there haVE been increasing attacks on journalists inside of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried or concerned about increasing attacks on journalists inside the country?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we condemn Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s vicious attack in Karachi on television journalist, Hamid Mir -- the latest in a series of worrisome attacks on journalists in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Freedom of the press, including ensuring that journalists can safely carry out their vital mission, is of paramount importance to freedom of expression and to the healthy functioning of any democracy.\xc2\xa0 We wish Hamid Mir a speedy recovery, and we urge the government of Pakistan to bring all those responsible for these attacks to justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, ever since the Syrian crisis started, President Obama has called on President Assad to step down; very often he said he lost his legitimacy.\xc2\xa0 He obviously hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done that.\xc2\xa0 And on top of that, they announced elections on June 3rd.\xc2\xa0 Is he making a mockery of the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s making a mockery of his own pretensions to being a democratically elected leader.\xc2\xa0 A presidential referendum, which is what this would be, is a parody of democracy and would have no credibility or legitimacy within Syria or outside of Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does this show any chance of reconciliation in terms of any peace talks with the opposition?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, would this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, would this announcement of elections -- because he seems adamant that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This announcement that has no credibility and would be a parody of democracy?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the way for the process to move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but my point is the U.N. says that the only way to end the Syrian crisis is through a political transition.\xc2\xa0 So now that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have this opportunity by him announcing the election, so what\xe2\x80\x99s the outcome for the Syrian crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the process that can lead to the political transition has to be a negotiated process and resolution through or with the opposition, and it would not include a referendum of the nature that has been announced that bears no hallmarks to true democracy, but is a sham, really.</p>\n<p>So the need for a political resolution remains.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way that the Syrian people can achieve a future where they have more freedom and are subjected to less tyranny.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to support the opposition; we continue to support the Syrian people through the substantial humanitarian aid that we provide; and we continue to push for a process whereby a negotiated settlement that leads to a political transition can be reached.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the break, Speaker Boehner was asked about the unemployment extension that passed the Senate and said that it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the White House essentially to come up with a new proposal on jobs before he\xe2\x80\x99ll consider an unemployment extension.\xc2\xa0 He said he told the President that in December and he\xe2\x80\x99s been waiting and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard a real jobs proposal since then.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the outcome here for those 2 million people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting their checks?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve noted that more Republicans have made clear their support for extension of vital unemployment insurance emergency benefits since the last time we discussed this in this room.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to press Congress to take action to restore those benefits.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the latest on how that effort is progressing on Capitol Hill, but our position remains very clear, which is that these are benefits that should be extended.\xc2\xa0 Extending them would be, of course, hugely impactful to the families who receive them directly, but also of great benefit to the economy.\xc2\xa0 And Congress ought to take action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House willing to consider offering some kind of a deal with Speaker Boehner on some of his priorities for those --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past in these kinds of situations generally are an attempt to throw spaghetti against the wall on sort of ideological things that have nothing to do with making sure that these benefits get to the people who need them.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:04 P.M.
