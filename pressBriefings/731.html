Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:23 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Or, shalom, to those of you who were on the trip with us last week.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see many people who were on the trip.\xc2\xa0 Only a couple, actually.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There are a couple.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not an insult, it\xe2\x80\x99s a compliment, in fact.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t think I have anything to do at the top today, so, Nedra, if you want to get it started.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that would be great.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on your view of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria?\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend you had the president of the Syrian National Coalition leave, and I wonder if the White House sees that as the opposition crumbling now in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly have seen these reports and we\'re sorry to see the news of Khatib\xe2\x80\x99s resignation.\xc2\xa0 Khatib is a courageous and pragmatic leader who has a strong sense of Syrians\xe2\x80\x99 hopes and fears.\xc2\xa0 The opposition has been well served by his leadership and the Syrian people will continue to benefit from his service in whatever capacity he chooses to provide it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s important to underscore that leadership transitions are inevitable in any democratic process, and Khatib\xe2\x80\x99s announcement does not change the U.S. policy of support for the Syrian opposition and the Syrian Opposition Coalition.\xc2\xa0 We support the coalition\xe2\x80\x99s vision for a tolerant, inclusive Syria that respects the rights of all Syrians.\xc2\xa0 And the opposition to Assad\xe2\x80\x99s brutal rule is bigger than one person, and that movement will continue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- the efforts of the opposition in Syria will continue unabated.\xc2\xa0 The United States will continue to support their efforts.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Nedra, the U.S. is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance there.\xc2\xa0 The President had the opportunity to talk to leaders in the region, including King Abdullah, who talked about the significant humanitarian strain that is being felt by the Syrian people and is starting to have an impact on other countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that we remain concerned about and committed to.\xc2\xa0 And while we\'re certainly sorry to see the news of Khatib\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, we\'re going to continue to work in the region to support the efforts of the rebels and to continue our steady drumbeat to urge Assad to step aside so that the Syrian people can have a government that reflects their will.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of his complaints was that there was a lack of international support, so I wonder if there are any next steps that might come from the United States.\xc2\xa0 Is there any examination of what more we could be doing or any thoughts that we could be doing more over there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s position is actually really clear in terms of what we\'ve done.\xc2\xa0 We have condemned repeatedly the brutality of the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We have lent our support to the Syrian Opposition Council.\xc2\xa0 We have acknowledged them as the representative of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 We have also worked in bilateral fashion with countries all around the world, including those countries in the region, to try to offer as much support as we possibly can to the Syrians as they weather what is a terrible, terrible, violent situation there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I mentioned, again, before that the United States bilaterally has also offered a number -- a lot of humanitarian support, including the fact that we are the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve also provided some logistical, non-lethal support that has also come in handy for Syrian rebels who are, again, fighting a regime that has not hesitated to use the military might of that regime against its own people.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we have strongly condemned, and that is something we\'re going to continue to work to bring to an end.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, the assault weapons ban is not going to be part of the bill that the Senate takes up.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder -- that was when the President was gone last week -- if you could give us an update.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about how important that is.\xc2\xa0 Is he making calls or doing anything to try to change that and fight for that provision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly supports an assault weapons ban that would -- legislation like that would serve a useful purpose, which is to remove military-style weapons from the streets.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen how those military-style weapons have been used to perpetrate terrible acts of violence in this country, and the President believes that there should be a ban on them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is something that the President has pushed for pretty aggressively not just in the aftermath of Newtown, but also in his inaugural -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, in his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 But also, it was part of the series of proposals that the President rolled out in mid-January, where he rolled out 23 specific executive actions that his administration could take unilaterally to try to address incidents of gun violence, steps that we could take that would reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 But he also laid out a series of legislative proposals that would require congressional action, and this was among those.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the announcement from the Senate last week is indication that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be part of the bill, but there was a clear indication that this would be something that would get a vote in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President spoke very powerfully about this in the State of the Union, that all of these measures that we know would have a tangible impact on reducing violence in communities all across the country deserve a vote.\xc2\xa0 And this is no exception.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take place sometime in the weeks to come here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the EU deal to rescue Cyprus includes a measure that will still affect depositors, and people with less than 100,000 euros will not be affected, but people with more will be. What is the U.S. position on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know, Jeff, that my colleagues at the Treasury Department have put out a statement on this.\xc2\xa0 As we have stood with our partners in Europe as they\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with some of the financial instability that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been experiencing over there, it has been -- the senior officials at the Treasury Department have been the principal point of contact for their colleagues.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about the impact that this instability on the financial system in Europe has had on the American economy, so it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in trying to help the Europeans to solve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut in terms of -- so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department for the statement that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already issued in terms of our view of the agreement that was announced overnight here.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything additional to say about it beyond their statement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President -- has he talked with anyone in Europe after this deal came through?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0 I know that a number of officials in the Treasury Department have been in touch with their colleagues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And let me just ask you on one other topic. The Supreme Court has some pretty high-profile cases this week on gay marriage.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House -- how is the White House watching this?\xc2\xa0 Are you sending any staff to the hearings? Will the President be watching?\xc2\xa0 If you can give us any color ahead of those hearings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Jeff, the Supreme Court doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually televise the hearings, so it will impact our ability to watch it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Touch\xc3\xa9.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I bet you he could get a seat.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe so.\xc2\xa0 Maybe so.\xc2\xa0 Maybe so.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are some people who have been waiting in line for quite some time already to try to get a seat, so it should make for some pretty good legal theater, if nothing else.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will anyone from here be in the Court?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not there will be administration -- Obama administration staffers in the room as the arguments are being held.\xc2\xa0 But this certainly is an issue that the President has followed carefully.\xc2\xa0 There have been briefs that have been filed in the case from the Department of Justice, representing the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s legal position on these issues.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details to offer you in terms of who\xe2\x80\x99s actually -- or whether or not there will be anybody in the room as the case is being heard -- the cases are being heard, I should say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the President going to sign the CR?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date for you.\xc2\xa0 I know that this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll sign before the deadline, which is later this week, so in the next couple of days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you anticipate it being a ceremonial occasion?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates to offer at this time, but when it gets closer and we can offer some more details we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will you point out, after the CR is signed, some of the effects of the sequestration, as you did before there was any kind of a deal and before it went into place?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some departments that do not have the ability, as you know, to reschedule their funds or reprogram them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you be pointing out to us what kind of hits they will take, say, in education, as you did before the sequester went into effect?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of reports from your colleagues in local television markets and in local newspapers all across the country that are talking about the impact that the sequester has had on their communities.\xc2\xa0 And this ranges from -- sort of runs the gamut of the kinds of programs that benefit from federal funding.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this includes Head Start programs.\xc2\xa0 This includes FAA towers that are being closed.\xc2\xa0 I know that there have been some concerns about the impact that the sequester would have on Meals on Wheels programs that provide food to the elderly.\xc2\xa0 So there are a range of impacts that are being felt all across the country, in communities all across the country, as a result of the sequester.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are leaders in Congress in both parties -- Democrats and Republicans -- who have said that the sequester is bad policy.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees that it\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy.\xc2\xa0 The President said that before the sequester went into effect and he said that afterwards.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has laid out his own specific proposal for reducing our deficit in a balanced way that would turn off the sequester; that would make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re making smart decisions about where we can make cuts to government spending; that would reform entitlement programs, but would also ask the wealthy and the well-connected to pay a little bit more to deal with our deficit challenges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was just wondering if the White House would take pains to point out, as you did before the sequester --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, at this point, now that the sequester has taken effect, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take pains.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to find with the click of a browser or tuning into a television station, which is I know your preferred method of getting news.\xc2\xa0 But that is available and those unfortunate impacts are being felt all across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put forward a plan that would deal with them definitively.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But yet you expect that they\xe2\x80\x99ll remain in place for the rest of this fiscal year, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what are we going to do?\xc2\xa0 How would they not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President has put forward his own plan that would reduce the deficit based on the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it shows no sign of being acted upon by anybody on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is that maybe you should ask them what they\'re doing to resolve the sequester.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President continues to be engaged in the effort, to find a way to reduce our deficits and get our deficits under control.\xc2\xa0 But he is going to insist that we do so in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And the only thing that\'s prevented us so far from reaching an agreement is Republicans who have said that they are not going to ask the wealthy and the well-connected to pay any more in taxes to deal with our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 This is something that they brag about.\xc2\xa0 This is something that they think is a testament to their fiscal reasonability.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the truth is I actually think -- and I think it\'s the view of the administration -- that it really shouldn\'t be difficult to solve this problem; that if we\'re going to ask teachers and students and veterans and middle-class families and seniors to make some sacrifices to deal with our deficit challenges -- that\'s something that the President is willing to do -- then we can\'t also --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me just finish this.\xc2\xa0 We also need to make sure that we\'re going to ask the wealthy and the well-connected to make some sacrifices, too.\xc2\xa0 And if we\'re willing to make everybody -- willing to ask everybody to make some sacrifices to deal with our deficits, then there\'s no reason we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to reach a deal that would turn off the sequester before the end of the fiscal year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Except possibly for the fact that the President\'s plan is not likely to pass Democrats in the Senate either.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have conversations with Democrats and Republicans to resolve this.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward his own very specific plan.\xc2\xa0 If there are others that have their own ideas for how to resolve these kinds of issues, then we\'re certainly happy to have a conversation with them.\xc2\xa0 But so far, what we\'ve seen -- and the reason that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten anything done is because Republicans have said we\'re not going to ask the wealthy and the well-connected to pay any more to deal with our deficits.\xc2\xa0 And that is not an approach the President is going to support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on the assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 Leader Reid dropped it because he said he didn\'t believe there was a chance that it could actually make its way through the Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that he would agree with your characterization as "dropping it."\xc2\xa0 Because what the Leader -- just to be clear, this is important -- what Leader Reid has said is that he would allow it to be offered up as an amendment, which would give everybody in the Senate the opportunity to vote on it and to have it be included as part of the legislation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President thinks that is really important.\xc2\xa0 And it will be a question for all 100 members of the Senate to ask themselves about whether or not they think that voting for and supporting an assault weapons ban would actually do something to reduce gun violence in communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to have that debate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They think that it faces an uncertain future.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that the assault weapons ban can actually make its way through the Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have found, as Bill was sort of pointing out in his questions, it is unwise to predict what exactly Congress is going to act on.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the President feels very strongly about.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the emotion and the passion with which he has engaged the American public and the Congress on this issue is evident and it\'s an indication of how strongly he feels about this.\xc2\xa0 And I think you can anticipate that the President is going to continue to ask Congress to consider a range of proposals, including the assault weapons ban, that would have a tangible impact on reducing violence in communities all across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, as you know, Mayor Bloomberg is rolling out a $12 million ad campaign.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any discussions between Mayor Bloomberg and the White House about this campaign, any coordination about the messaging?\xc2\xa0 It\'s focusing really on universal background checks, which would indicate that that is what the Mayor believes has the best chance of passing.\xc2\xa0 So has there been any coordination?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to any specific coordination.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Vice President recently met with Mayor Bloomberg where they talked about a range of issues, including proposals that would reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of whether or not there was any coordination or advice that Mayor Bloomberg sought for his political activities, I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly have been in touch with Mayor Bloomberg, as we have been with a range of individuals.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President led a process at the beginning of this year where they met with scores of groups and individuals who are invested in both protecting the Second Amendment and reducing gun violence in our communities.\xc2\xa0 And that process of those series of meetings yielded 23 executive actions that the President initiated right away, and a whole set of legislative proposals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward to Congress.\xc2\xa0 So the administration and certainly Vice President Biden and the President have been very engaged in this process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of Syria, Josh, does the administration have a better sense at this point in time, now that several days have passed, about whether or not chemical weapons were actually used?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new information to relate to you at this point.\xc2\xa0 We are certainly -- we continue to be concerned and interested in a U.N. investigation into what actually transpired so that we can get to the bottom of this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President, from this podium, spoke very clearly about the consequences of Syria or members of the Syrian regime using chemical weapons or moving them around in a way that would contribute to their vulnerability or to their transfer to other groups.\xc2\xa0 The President and others have been very clear that the handling and safeguarding of chemical weapons is something that not just the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, is going to be held responsible for, but the individuals who are actually responsible for safeguarding that material themselves will be held accountable for doing so.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this remains something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to investigate and want to get to the bottom of, and we support the U.N. investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s started.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that the Syrian regime will actually cooperate with the U.N. investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s moving forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post quotes an administration official as saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had to go in tomorrow to deal with chemical weapons, I\xe2\x80\x99d say we aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that concern, that assessment, and is that, in fact, the case?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information to share with you right now about the contingency plans that we have in place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWendell.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, was today\xe2\x80\x99s event on immigration reform an indication the President might not have as much confidence as he\xe2\x80\x99d like in the Group of Eight\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the President remains confident that the Group of Eight -- this is the bipartisan group of senators, Democrats and Republicans, in the Senate that are working together to try to find a bipartisan approach to comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased with the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99re reportedly making.\xc2\xa0 The President has had a couple of conversations with members of that group.\xc2\xa0 Our staff at the White House has been very engaged with them at the staff level, meeting with them on a pretty regular basis as they work through this compromise agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you happy with the agreement as it is unfolding, as you understand it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I want to reserve judgment on the actual product until it gets presented, until the bill gets filed.\xc2\xa0 But we take a lot of confidence in what Senator Schumer said over the weekend about the plans that the Senate has for introducing legislation -- or beginning this process when they return from their Easter vacation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the other side of that, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas says the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really want a bill to emerge from these talks; what he wants is for the bill to crater so that he can use the issue as a political wedge in 2014 to 2016.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence to support those claims.\xc2\xa0 What the President has been saying for quite some time now is that he believes that comprehensive immigration reform is in the best interests of the economy of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 It also is the best way to demonstrate that we are both a nation of immigrants, but also a nation of laws.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is a piece of legislation that falls in line with the principles that the President has offered.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President would be very pleased if those principles had strong bipartisan support when they\xe2\x80\x99re presented before the United States Senate and is hopeful that with that bipartisan support would pass the Congress and would be something that the President could sign into law sooner rather than later.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on gun control, could you clear up once and for all, A, does the President favor a national registry of gun sales; and B, if he does, is he going to use that to take away people\xe2\x80\x99s guns?\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, as you know, Karl Rove said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that scares a lot of people who believe in the Second Amendment is the federal government keeping a national registry of gun sales and gun purchasers.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President want that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that the President is a very strong believer in the Second Amendment.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly in the constitutional right to bear arms.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has advocated is a set of universal background checks that would ensure that people who are not supposed to have guns -- so these are people with mental disabilities, these are criminals -- should not have access to guns.\xc2\xa0 What we want to make sure is that we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them, but without interfering with the ability of law-abiding citizens to get their guns that they would like to buy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also clear is that the President does not believe that there is any reason that guns would be taken away from law-abiding citizens.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for that.\xc2\xa0 That is not part of any proposal that the President has offered, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we support at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you need a national registry of those who own guns legally in order to track them and in order to provide background checks.\xc2\xa0 Or could you do background checks without it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is not something that the President has supported.\xc2\xa0 What the President has supported are background checks.\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s supported a lot of things, but in terms of in the context in which you\xe2\x80\x99re asking this question -- does the President support background checks?\xc2\xa0 The President supported laws against trafficking of guns.\xc2\xa0 The President has supported laws against straw purchasing, which basically is holding people accountable for purchasing weapons and then transferring them to people who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lawfully purchase those weapons on their own. These are the kinds of reforms that the President is seeking in the system.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not seeking a registry like what you\xe2\x80\x99ve described.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBrianna.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President said today that Congress must muster the political courage to pass immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Why is he saying that now if he\xe2\x80\x99s confident, if he\xe2\x80\x99s encouraged by what he\xe2\x80\x99s seen with the Gang of Eight and hearing what Senator Schumer said?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because the President wants to continue to encourage them to make progress.\xc2\xa0 As we have laid out -- for the last couple of months, we have seen a bipartisan Group of Eight senators working to trying to come together around a compromise to reform our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that we all agree on, both Democrats and Republicans, is that our system needs to be reformed.\xc2\xa0 And that is what this bipartisan group of senators has been working on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe White House has been engaged in the effort as they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to put pen to paper to formulate what this compromise would look like.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have a lot of ideas that the President has presented both in the campaign, but also the President presented in his speech that he gave in Las Vegas back in January.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of ideas that we have to contribute to this effort.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing in the Senate right now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged that this bipartisan group seems to be making progress and we want to support that progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reserve judgment on the final product until it\xe2\x80\x99s presented.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that they say that they\xe2\x80\x99re on track to present it shortly after they return from their Easter recess.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned, though, that they\xe2\x80\x99re not mustering the political courage?\xc2\xa0 I ask because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Gang of Eight, you have Senator Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s comments sort of about where they are with things.\xc2\xa0 Rand Paul, sort of, of all people, has talked about a pathway to legalization.\xc2\xa0 I mean, does he think that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t mustering the political courage?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is hopeful that when this bill, when this compromised piece of legislation that has bipartisan support, when it is eventually presented and works its way through the committee process and then presented to the floor of the Senate, that senators in both parties will demonstrate the courage necessary to vote for it.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, that is the goal here, is for us to have a comprehensive -- a piece of legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive in nature that reflects the principles that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd once that occurs, the President is hopeful that there will be a lot of political courage on display in the Congress when that comes up for a vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow on Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question about the assault weapons ban, making the ban as an amendment is perhaps an effort, it seems, to stops the proposal from taking down the entire bill. And the thought of so many people is that if it\xe2\x80\x99s an amendment that means it\xe2\x80\x99s -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s voted on as an amendment, they look at it and they see, okay, this thing is done.\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it that way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see it as another opportunity for members of the United States Senate to demonstrate some political courage.\xc2\xa0 It is the view of the President.\xc2\xa0 It is the view of a lot of individuals and a lot of leaders and a lot of groups that both support the Second Amendment and believe in the Second Amendment, but also are interested in trying to reduce gun violence in communities all across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it the strategy you would like to have seen, considering it basically means that it\xe2\x80\x99s dead?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into legislative strategy in the Senate from up here.\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t have the standing with which to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he supports it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he want it to be part of the overall bill and not an amendment, which basically means it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pass?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President could not -- could literally -- to paraphrase the Vice President -- could literally not have been any clearer when he talked about this in the State of the Union address, in which he said that he believed that these measures, including the assault weapons ban, deserves a vote.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then the question is going to be what the members of the Senate are willing to do.\xc2\xa0 Are they willing to demonstrate the political courage to take the kind of step that we know would have a significant impact on getting military-style weapons off the streets of communities all across the United States of America?\xc2\xa0 That will be a significant vote when it occurs, and we hope that members of the Senate, and in the House when they have the opportunity, will demonstrate the political courage necessary to see it pass.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around here a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just staying with the assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 Has the President used the full resources of his office to try to get this ban passed?\xc2\xa0 For example, has he asked Organizing For Action, his outside group, to make this an important issue?\xc2\xa0 Is he willing to travel the country?\xc2\xa0 Is he willing to use the full extent of the bully pulpit and try to build a consensus for this the way he\xe2\x80\x99s tried to build consensus for other pieces of his agenda -- from immigration to jobs programs in the past?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I -- I think there are a number of ways in which the President has talked about this very publicly. The first is the President and the Vice President and other members of the White House staff have been very engaged by talking to groups with a variety of points of view, a variety of perspectives on these issues, to enlist them in this effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President spoke very eloquently and very powerfully about this issue in his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 I think many of you wrote about how persuasive his language about these specific proposals deserving a vote could be.\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate that you will see the President using the power of the bully pulpit, as you described it, by traveling across the country a little bit and talking about some of these issues, including this one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have something to announce?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t at this point.\xc2\xa0 But the Vice President himself has also traveled the country pretty extensively to talk about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that remains a priority for the President and something that we will push for in a variety of ways.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAri.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any insight into tonight\xe2\x80\x99s White House Seder for Passover?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that the President started doing with members of his staff and some friends during the campaign in 2008.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a nice story -- and I know that one of your colleagues at The Washington Post wrote about this just today -- to talk about the special meaning that this event has for the President, that when the President participated in a Seder during the campaign in I believe it was April of 2008, it was an opportunity for him to spend some time with staff on the campaign and with friends, and it was a very meaningful moment on the campaign for him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as President, this is a tradition that he\xe2\x80\x99s continued here in the White House, where many of the staff members who participated in that dinner in 2008 have been invited back to participate in the dinner in subsequent years, actually in the White House.\xc2\xa0 So this has been a very, very powerful event for the President.\xc2\xa0 He even talked about it a little bit in the speech that he gave in Jerusalem last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in terms of -- they will participate in the traditional Seder activities, and I know that there are some secret family recipes that are involved in the whole thing as well.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President looks forward to every year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xe2\x80\x99ll use some of the things that he brought back from Israel?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am told that one of the gifts that was given to the First Lady by Prime Minister Netanyahu\'s wife was a Seder plate, and it\'s my understanding that they will be using that Seder plate for tonight\'s dinner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGoyal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions and thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as democracy in Pakistan is concerned, they have, for the first time in history, a five years full term as a democratic government in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And now, they have a caretaker prime minister and an election will be on May 11th.\xc2\xa0 The President has any message for the people of Pakistan, which they are really saying that in the five years they have not seen much development as far as people-to-people or development for the people -- what will the future?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Goyal, I never hesitate to weigh in when it comes to American politics.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to Pakistani politics, we\'ll leave it to the people of Pakistan to make decisions about their political leadership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as sequestration is concerned, our economy -- economic problem going on, or drama in this -- here, global economy depends on Washington, on the White House and on the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 What message do you think the President has\xc2\xa0 -- or if he has spoken with global leaders, people -- leaders around the globe, because they are also worried what happens in Washington is also squeezing their economy back home.\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken with anybody?\xc2\xa0 Or any message for them, what they should do?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has said when it comes to the economy is that the way to ensure that the U.S. is strongest economically is for us to have a thriving and growing middle class here in this country.\xc2\xa0 And so the President has put forward a series of proposals to ensure that we have a strong and thriving middle class.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President -- we\'ve talked a little bit about what are the kinds of things that the President is going to be talking to members of Congress about.\xc2\xa0 Some of the things that he is going to be talking to them about are some of the economic proposals that he has put forward to strengthen the middle class in this country -- things like raising the minimum wage and then indexing it to inflation; proposals that would include investing in our infrastructure that would have the benefit of both job creation in the short term, but laying the foundation for our long-term economic strength; but also, things like early childhood education, expanding access to early childhood education for children all across the country, that that has a significant impact and could have a significant impact on the ability of those kids to grow up and get a high school education and get a college education, and succeed economically, and eventually have families of their own that would succeed in the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo when you talk about the President\'s economic agenda, that\'s what he is really focused on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as education is concerned, do you think Obama think knowledge initiative is going to make any impact on this because of a lack of --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there certainly is no reason that something like an early childhood education proposal shouldn\'t have some bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 There are -- some of the states where early childhood education programs have been pioneered, where genuine investments have been made are states like Georgia and Alabama, states that are not traditionally known to be dominated by Democrats, as you will.\xc2\xa0 So these are the kinds of programs that traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support at the state level.\xc2\xa0 We hope that will be true in the United States Congress as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAlexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back to guns for a second -- two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 You were talking about political courage would guide lawmakers who would go for an assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that the White House views any lawmaker who votes against the assault weapons is a political coward?\xc2\xa0 That would be the reason that they vote against it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I\'m saying at all.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that this will be a prominent vote in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been very clear about what he supports and what he believes.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that an assault weapons ban would actually do something significant to reduce gun violence in communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he strongly supports it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President also strongly supports things like universal background checks, legislation that would outlaw straw purchasers and other measures that would reduce the ability of -- that would reduce gun trafficking.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a range of measures that are before the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that those measures that would have an impact on reducing gun violence across the country should be passed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he strongly supports it and he\xe2\x80\x99ll advocate strongly for their passage.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on assault weapons, does the administration concede that there would be lawmakers who have other reservations about the ban as it may be constructed that is separate and apart from their political worries about their seats or their districts or whatever?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling that out at all.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is, is that every member of the United States Senate will have the opportunity to cast a vote on an assault weapons ban, and we hope that they\xe2\x80\x99ll support it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then the second question I had is, you were talking about how hard the President and the Vice President have been working since November and Newtown to continue to press this issue, to educate the public, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 When the administration looks at the surveys of public opinion, can you point to where the public maybe has moved or they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking has evolved since the administration has been making this press, especially on assault weapons?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there might be others in this room who look at polls a little bit more carefully than I do. The President, honestly, at this point, is not in a situation where he\xe2\x80\x99s examining polls and trying to determine what are the kinds of things that have -- well, let me say it this way -- the President is not looking at polls to try and figure out what kind of gun control measures or measures that would reduce gun violence he should support.\xc2\xa0 What the President is doing is he\xe2\x80\x99s taking a look at the different proposals that have been put forward and considering which of those would actually have an impact on reducing gun violence in our communities.\xc2\xa0 And those measures that would reduce gun violence in our communities while at the same time protecting the Second Amendment are exactly the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I asked you.\xc2\xa0 My question was, since the President put forward his positions, his proposals, his ideas, his principles, has he seen public thinking migrate because of his communication efforts?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you may look at the polls a little bit more carefully than I do.\xc2\xa0 What we do see, though, is that there actually is a lot of strong support for the proposals that the President has put forward, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s universal background checks, whether it is outlawing gun trafficking or straw purchasers.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s even some support out there in the public for the assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not why the President supports it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President is certainly pleased that the public does have strong support for those measures.\xc2\xa0 But the President is supportive of these measures because they actually could have an impact on reducing gun violence in this country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President will urge members of the House and Senate to vote for it when they have the chance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President today designated five new national monuments, using his executive authority, and obviously, Republicans have been critical of that.\xc2\xa0 In light of the fact that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t designated a new national park or wilderness in years now at this point, is this something where we should anticipate the President moving again, particularly when there is strong local support if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about in Utah, Cedar Mesa, or Boulder White Clouds in Idaho?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the President plans to make a priority in his second term?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we just did five new national monuments today, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional new national monuments to tell you about at this point.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, these kinds of designations are important both for, in some cases, for the local economy in these communities.\xc2\xa0 Oftentimes, they will designate and commemorate important parts of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an important part of what the President was hoping to do today.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of future decisions along these lines, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just a follow-up on that.\xc2\xa0 Doc Hastings, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Chairman of the House of Natural Resources Committee, said that this was an odd time to be bringing this up when the government is struggling with the sequester, White House tours are closed, many agencies including the Park Service is struggling to keep open what they have.\xc2\xa0 I think his quote was, this is the government spending money it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have on properties it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t own.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my sense is, is that these designations today don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily -- are made for important reasons, as I laid out before; that they have an impact on local economies; that they will -- that you can see local economies growing up around the designation of these properties that as visitors come to enjoy these new national monuments that will have a stimulative impact on the local economies in these communities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey also reflect a way to commemorate and, in some cases, even celebrate the history of this country.\xc2\xa0 So there are important reasons for why the President took this step.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the impact that this is going to have on the budget of the Department of Interior and the National Park Service, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for that analysis.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, however, that a lot of the land for these new national monuments was either land that was already owned by the federal government or it was donated.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the immediate costs in terms of the management of the land, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty minimal in the early stages.\xc2\xa0 But certainly future budgets that the administration will offer will reflect the acquisition of these new properties.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more thing.\xc2\xa0 Why was it closed, the signing closed?\xc2\xa0 It fairly -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I almost made a pun -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a monumental -- (laughter) -- piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why close?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are not even stills in it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we were able at the last minute to include some stills in there.\xc2\xa0 There were a lot of people moving in and out who are participating in the ceremony.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that was announced a couple of days ago so maybe we underestimated your interest in it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Friday, the President is going to go down to Florida for an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Could you expand on that a little bit?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to announce?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to tell you about that trip at this point, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got another four days for you to plan for that exciting trip to south Florida, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that later this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your reaction to two recent statements by Congresswoman Michele Bachmann.\xc2\xa0 The first about the opulence here at the White House -- five chefs on Air Force One, two projectionists, and a high-paid dog walker -- true?\xc2\xa0 Necessary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not true?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the fact that Obamacare is literally killing men, women, and children?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see some -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s any evidence of that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what the -- since you threw that softball out there, it sort of does seem a useful time for us to talk about, if I can find it here, some of the useful parts of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, Saturday was the third anniversary of the signing of that piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 And there were some landmark benefits that were included in that bill that people are still enjoying today.\xc2\xa0 There are millions of seniors all across the country that are paying on average about $600 a year less on their prescription drugs.\xc2\xa0 There are tens of millions of Americans who no longer have to worry about the lifetime cap on their insurance policy running out.\xc2\xa0 And certainly something that people in both parties can agree is a good thing is that it will actually have a significant impact on reducing our deficit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think in both cases she\xe2\x80\x99s deliberately not telling the truth?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that assessment to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJC?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the President with the change that just went on over the weekend in terms of the Syrian opposition leadership?\xc2\xa0 And has the President been in touch with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Cameron, or the President of France in terms of the conversations as to the next steps, including Prime Minister Netanyahu as well?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific calls to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as I mentioned in answering Nedra\xe2\x80\x99s question, that we certainly are sorry to see Khatib step down.\xc2\xa0 But our support for the Syrian opposition will not diminish in any way.\xc2\xa0 We continue to support the effort that\xe2\x80\x99s underway there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe continue also to work closely with our international partners, our allies, and other interested parties around the globe, who are trying to bring to an end the violence in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has that created any additional anxiety in terms of the process that\xe2\x80\x99s going on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, what I would just say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously sorry to see him go, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change our level of support for the Syrian people as they seek to end the violence in their country and to seek to put in place a government that will actually reflect the aspirations and will of the people who live there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us, is the U.S. government helping its allies and partners vet who should receive funds and weapons among the Syrian opposition?\xc2\xa0 That question seems to be even more pertinent now given what you were just discussing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reports that have alluded to some CIA activities along these lines.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on those reports or on any activities like that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there are a range of other things that we have been doing to support the Syrian people, and I mentioned earlier that we\xe2\x80\x99re single largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President talk in his news conference with King Abdullah in Amman on Friday about the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to see more support for Jordan as they try to meet the needs of the tens of thousands of Syrians who are fleeing the violence in that country and are coming to Jordan as a result of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to continue to work in international fashion to show our support for the Syrian opposition to offer some non-lethal support to them, but also to generally continue to pressure Assad in the form of sanctions and other things to isolate him further and to make it clear that it is time for him to go, that a transition should take place, and that a government that reflects the will of the Syrian people should take root in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you also clarify what is precisely the red line when it comes to chemical weapons in Syria?\xc2\xa0 Are there some chemical agents, non-lethal agents that would not be defined under that red line?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go any further on describing this than the President himself has when he spoke at this podium, I believe last August or September, and described what that red line was.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t add anything to what the President said there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just finally, I realize you can\'t discuss what the CIA is up to.\xc2\xa0 But, presumably, the administration is concerned about more extremist militant elements in the Syrian opposition, and this resignation really underlines that.\xc2\xa0 You must be discussing that with allies and what is the future of the opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, the President in his news conference, again, with King Abdullah on Friday talked about the concern that he had that because of the vacuum that\'s created by the instability and chaos that exists in Syria right now, that that is attractive to extremist elements and those who want to perpetrate violence.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that has not just the United States concerned, but countries throughout the region and our allies around the world concerned about the impact that that chaos could have and whether or not it creates an opportunity for extremists and those with violent intentions to try to capitalize on that terrible situation.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the reasons that the President is so urgently working with our international partners to try to find a solution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:06 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
