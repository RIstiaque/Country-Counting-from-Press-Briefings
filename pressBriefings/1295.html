BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thank you guys for coming.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 Once again, the President wanted me to extend his thanks and appreciation to the folks of Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard for their hospitality, for the good food here, for what nice folks run the shops, and once again, appreciates that last year there was so much respect for the First Family\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, and especially the girls, as they had such a good time here.</p>\n<p>So today I have with me John Brennan, who will talk a little bit about this first anniversary of the release of the mastermind behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie.</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 As Bill said, today is the one-year anniversary of the unfortunate, inappropriate and wrong decision by the Scottish executive to release Abdel Basset Mohamed al-Megrahi, a Libyan national who was rightly convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on 21 December 1988.\xc2\xa0 That reprehensible act of terrorism claimed the lives of 270 innocent individuals, including 189 U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p>We have made clear repeatedly that we emphatically disagree with that decision to release Megrahi.\xc2\xa0 We made that position known before the decision was made by the Scottish executive, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to make that decision, the wrongness of that decision, clear to both Scottish and Libyan authorities.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed our strong conviction that al-Megrahi should serve out the remainder, the entirety, of his sentence in a Scottish prison.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to reiterate this position to the Scottish and Libyan authorities.\xc2\xa0 And the President extends his deepest sympathies to those affected by that reprehensible act of terrorism, especially those families and friends of the victims of that tragic act.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>I also would draw your attention to the statement that was released this morning by Secretary of State Clinton on the release of Megrahi.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, with that, Erica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, other than making your displeasure clear repeatedly, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve done since the outset, are there any concrete steps that you can take or are taking?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think I said, it is our view that Megrahi should serve out the remainder of his sentence in a Scottish prison, which would require his return to Scotland.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, the prognosis of his near-term demise that prompted the decision by the Scottish executive to have this compassionate release -- and we certainly take umbrage at that reference to compassion, because Megrahi did not have any compassion at all for those victims -- so we are continuing to convey our sentiments to the Scottish authorities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to call for his return to Scotland and that he serves out his prison sentence there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But other than conveying your sentiments, is there anything concrete that you can do or are doing?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Clearly, this was a decision in the license for his release, which was an act by the Scottish authorities.\xc2\xa0 We have conveyed to the Scottish authorities our position, and has Prime Minister Cameron, who was here, and this was an issue that came up during his recent visit.\xc2\xa0 So we are continuing to make clear our position.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have any new information about any possible involvement by BP in this whole matter?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 This act was looked at very carefully by the court that convicted Megrahi, and the culprit in this attack is very clear.\xc2\xa0 And I will leave it, again, at that.\xc2\xa0 Again, what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on today is the regrettable decision of the Scottish authorities to release Megrahi.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get right back after Alister.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, I wonder if I could ask a question about Mr. Bout, Viktor Bout.\xc2\xa0 Is that a subject you can talk to?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Viktor Bout, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Viktor Bout.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any concern that his extradition may yet hit an obstacle in getting him back quickly to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The Thai appellate court on 20 August upheld the extradition request, or concurred that he could be extradited to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We appreciate very much that decision.\xc2\xa0 Viktor Bout is somebody who for two decades was responsible for arms trafficking and supporting terrorist organizations on multiple continents -- South America, in Africa and in Asia.\xc2\xa0 He was arrested in March of 2008.\xc2\xa0 We have sought his extradition so he could be tried in New York.\xc2\xa0 We are very pleased with the cooperation of Thai authorities.\xc2\xa0 And we are looking forward to his expeditious return here.</p>\n<p>This is something that a number of governments throughout the world believe is very important so that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to stop these illegal arms traffickers from carrying out their activities, which are undergirding the ability of terrorist organizations and other groups to carry out attacks worldwide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any problem -- do you expect there to be any obstacle in him being speedily removed back to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The Thai appellate court overruled the decision of a lower court, so we are very pleased and we are very hopeful that this will be able to be carried out in a very short time.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, some of the critics -- or some of the supporters of the Islamic center, the proposed Islamic center in lower Manhattan, have said that the opposition to it could fuel anti-American sentiment in the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m -- being that this has gone on now for several weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering have you detected any of that?\xc2\xa0 Have America\xe2\x80\x99s enemies been using this as a propaganda tool -- the opposition to the Islamic center?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re staying focused on countering terrorist threats wherever they might develop.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of reasons that terrorist groups will point to, many of them unfounded.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, we are continuing to prosecute the war against al Qaeda very effectively in many different parts of the world.</p>\n<p>So we are continuing to stay focused on that.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of opportunities that we have with our partners to continue to have success against al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 We really have had the opportunity over the past year to undercut a number of their capabilities, and we continue to do so.</p>\n<p>So the debate over what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in New York City is something that I\xe2\x80\x99m not really focused on at this point.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m focused on making sure that we can keep the American people safe and prevent these terrorist groups from carrying out attacks here or anywhere.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking to wade into the debate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if -- because supporters of the project have said opposition to it will affect the efforts at counterterrorism by the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen any evidence of that?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen evidence of that to date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of Megrahi, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- there have been diplomatic efforts with Libya in the past few years -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that is at all a means to urge the government, either by stepping back from the diplomatic inroads that have been made, or using the new relationship in some way to get him back in that Scottish prison.</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to have effective and productive diplomatic exchanges with Libya on a variety of issues, including counterproliferation -- counterterrorism as well.\xc2\xa0 We will use those diplomatic channels to convey our sentiments on a broad range of issues, to include Mr. al-Megrahi.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Chip.\xc2\xa0 Oh, Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you wanted to say about the announcement today that Secretary of State Clinton has made about the peace talks -- the Arab and the Palestinian and Israeli --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, nothing in particular.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that this is something that the United States -- with President Obama, to Secretary Clinton, to George Mitchell -- have been working on for a very long time, and we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously pleased it\xe2\x80\x99s moving forward.</p>\n<p>If you have anything to add?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could ask Mr. Brennan on that exact topic, on the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 When the parties come to the table, do you see any change in the kinds of threats and the number of threats you see from around the world?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging, from your point of view?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Senator Mitchell said it quite well at his press briefing this morning, that what we can\xe2\x80\x99t do is to allow extremist militants and those who are opposed to peace in the Middle East prevent these negotiations from moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And for too long I think the extremists have been able to hold certain activities hostage because of their acts.</p>\n<p>We are going forward with this with a strong sense that these talks can succeed.\xc2\xa0 There is a commitment now by the Israelis to participate in it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that the Palestinians are going to agree shortly to participate as well.\xc2\xa0 And so what we need to do is to make sure that all sides remain committed for these talks over the next year.</p>\n<p>And there may be militant groups out there, terrorist organizations that will point to this as yet one more reason for them to carry out their cowardice acts.\xc2\xa0 But I know the United States is not going to be deterred from its role in facilitating these talks, direct talks between the parties.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly hope and I know the President and this administration hopes that all sides will remain committed, irrespective of what these extremist organizations or militant groups might say or even do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you be briefing the President every day here?\xc2\xa0 And do you do those in person?\xc2\xa0 Is it multiple times a day, or just one time a day?\xc2\xa0 How much time do you expect to spend with him every day?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I briefed the President this morning.\xc2\xa0 I flew up with the President yesterday on the plane.\xc2\xa0 Any time that I have anything that I need to convey to the President, I can do it very quickly.\xc2\xa0 I can be in touch with him a number of times during the day.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that that will be the same throughout the course of the time here on the island.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And most of that is face to face?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I was out at the farm this morning, but a lot of it is -- whatever means that I have in order to get information to him as quickly as possible, if there is a need for that, I have that ability to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the topics include?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 All the things that you would expect to be included in a national security briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, please?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 And probably a lot you don\xe2\x80\x99t expect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m completely serious -- is the threshold by which you decide, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I need to talk to the President,\xe2\x80\x9d change at all because we\xe2\x80\x99re in vacation mode here?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of issues that the President is following very, very closely, and expects to be kept informed about developments on those issues.\xc2\xa0 I am working very closely with those who are at the White House, with our team here, to make sure that I have full visibility into those national security issues.\xc2\xa0 And then I will make the determination, in consultation with others.\xc2\xa0 General Jones is also involved in moving forward on national security issues.\xc2\xa0 And so what I need to do is make the decision about whether something needs to get to the President immediately, or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I can wait until the next scheduled briefing for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Abdulmutallab happened while he was on vacation in Hawaii.\xc2\xa0 Is there any disadvantage to having the President on vacation when something like that happens?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Communication systems are very robust.\xc2\xa0 We can move information at the speed of light.\xc2\xa0 We can get to him very easily here.\xc2\xa0 I have immediate access if I need that.\xc2\xa0 So if there were to be some type of event that would require immediate engagement with the President, I am certain I can do it as quickly as I could do back in Washington.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 And I would just add to your question, Mike, that along with the national security briefings that the President is receiving, he also has quite robust economic daily briefings that he\xe2\x80\x99s receiving from his team.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s always picking up the phone and calling his advisors and folks to talk about the economy as well, especially when there\xe2\x80\x99s new news to be had.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is this level of optimism that these talks, direct talks, will succeed.\xc2\xa0 What is the basis for that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be making -- what\xe2\x80\x99s making it different this time around?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Senator Mitchell has been involved of the past year plus in engaging with the parties -- the Israelis, the Palestinians and others -- to lay the groundwork and the framework for these talks to be able to take place.</p>\n<p>There is a feeling, I think, within this administration that the parties have a strong commitment to forging peace that can endure in the region.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of issues that are outstanding.\xc2\xa0 It was made very clear that there are no preconditions to these talks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, Senator Mitchell has worked day and night for quite a while, working with the parties involved in this, and the sense is that the time is right to move forward.\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Mitchell said no time is ever perfect or right, but what we need to do is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to move forward with a sense of commitment and dedication.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President has made very clear that peace in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and the Palestinians, is central to U.S. interests but it\xe2\x80\x99s also central to the security interests of the Palestinian people, the Israelis, as well as the region as a whole.\xc2\xa0 So we are very hopeful.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Let me come back to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times reported this morning that the U.S. has reassured Israel on the immediacy or the timeline it believes a nuclearized Iran could pose to Israel.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on whether or not you endorse that point of view, how that point of view has been conveyed, what reaction there has been from Israeli officials?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address any Israeli assessments of the Iranian nuclear program, nor will I address in open forum here our assessments of that, other than to say that we are very concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s continued refusal to engage constructively with the P5-plus-1, to demonstrate through actions that its nuclear program is peaceful.</p>\n<p>And we are continuing to move forward, applying pressure to Iran, to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to see that it is in their own interest and to their benefit that they deal constructively with the international community on this very important issue.</p>\n<p>So clearly we are very concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s continued activity in this area.\xc2\xa0 But again, I will leave the assessments sort of off the table at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason I ask is when we checked at State, CIA, the Pentagon, they said you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to the White House on this story, that this is a White House action taken on behalf of a White House assessment of either new intelligence or a new appraisal of where Iran is technologically.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the White House has detected that can be described even generically as new and important as it understands the timeline of this potential threat?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We are encouraged by the international support for the sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 We also, though, realize that in addition to maintaining that sanctions regime on Iran, that we need to stay focused on preventing Iran from having a nuclear capability.\xc2\xa0 That is what our engagement has been with regional players, with our allies in the region and in the international community.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>So we are looking at this issue very carefully.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring it carefully as well.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to stay in very close dialogue with countries in the region, including Israel, on the status of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 But again, what we need to do is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to convince Iran, with the international community, that it needs to abide by its international obligations -- something that it has to date refused to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly monitoring counterterrorism threats.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had time since the al-Shabaab took responsibility for the attack at the end of -- or near the end of the World Cup, what you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned, if anything, more about that?\xc2\xa0 And do you -- as some counterterrorism analysts now suspect that was kind of a breakout action on their part, to take them out of what would be a confined area of terrorist activities to one that\xe2\x80\x99s more broadly -- that, one, makes them much more of a -- if not a regional player, perhaps a more lethal player outside of the particular confines it had operated in earlier.</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about the demonstrated ability of certain groups in that region -- al-Shabaab had claimed responsibility for that attack -- to carry out attacks outside of Somalia, and concern that it might indicate that there would be a broader effort on the part of some elements of al-Shabaab to carry out attacks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with Ugandan officials.\xc2\xa0 The investigation is continuing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working very diligently to prevent similar types of attacks.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda has had a presence in Africa for many years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the relationship that might exist between certain elements within al-Shabaab and al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda carried out two attacks against U.S. embassies in Africa over a decade ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So clearly, what we need to do is to continue to work with our African partners to maintain pressure on militant groups within Africa that are aligning with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 But the attack in Kampala was exceptionally tragic and unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But what we have done as a result of that is to redouble our efforts as far as working with our African partners in this area, including with the TFG, the transitional government in Somalia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is something that requires continued focus and efforts, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to focus on these issues, whether they take place in Africa or taking place in South Asia, Yemen, or other areas.\xc2\xa0 Working with our partners, building capacity, allowing them to take the lead in fighting these terrorist organizations and preventing these attacks is a real priority of this administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Middle East, (inaudible) flesh out the President\xe2\x80\x99s role going forward, not the role that he\xe2\x80\x99s played thus far in getting the parties to the table -- going forward.\xc2\xa0 I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s a dinner, for example, the day before.\xc2\xa0 To what extent will he be involved, hands on, in these bridging proposals or stepping in when there are disagreements, and into the direct talks themselves?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you said, the President will be hosting a dinner on September 1st.\xc2\xa0 He also will be holding bilateral meetings with the leaders who will be coming here to participate in the talks.\xc2\xa0 The talks themselves will take place on September 2nd.\xc2\xa0 These will be direct talks.\xc2\xa0 As we said, the United States is playing the role of facilitator in this regard.\xc2\xa0 We talked about a one-year timeframe, looking at making progress in that time.\xc2\xa0 And this is the relaunching of those direct talks.\xc2\xa0 And so the process is now ahead of us.\xc2\xa0 The engagement and involvement of the United States is going to stay strong and sustained and at a high level.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement and involvement in the future in these talks will be determined by developments as we go forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on the Middle East?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say that there\xe2\x80\x99s no preconditions, but has there been any kind of indication or promise from the Israelis about extending this settlement moratorium?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as was said this morning by Secretary Clinton, as well as by Senator Mitchell, that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 position is that we want to make sure that the environment in the region is conducive to making progress on these very fundamental issues that lie in front of us as far as being able to forge a peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 The settlement issue is one that the United States government has spoken out on in the past.\xc2\xa0 We have our position on that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made that position known.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, what we want to do is to make sure that there is going to be an environment that is as conducive to making the progress that we need to make, and that means an environment on both sides that each side then can look to the other and gain additional trust and confidence that there is this commitment to moving forward in a very constructive and productive way</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on Mike\xe2\x80\x99s question, can you talk a little bit about what the President is going to ask of Mubarak and King Abdullah?\xc2\xa0 And particularly, if you could, in regards to Hamas, does he want to see new elections --</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 President Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan are the heads of state of the two Arab states that have peace treaties with Israel.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, their involvement in this and encouragement of the Palestinians is important.</p>\n<p>There has been I think extensive consultation, not just with those two leaders but also with other Arab leaders, to ensure that Palestinians feel as though they can move forward with confidence knowing that they have that support from their Arab partners.</p>\n<p>So when the Palestinians come, and President Mubarak and King Abdullah come, it is with a sense that this is something that is important not just for the Palestinian and Israeli people but also for the region as a whole.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As far as what will be asked of them, this is something, again, that is going to move forward as direct talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\xc2\xa0 The United States, Egypt, Jordan, others -- the Quartet -- are all going to be helping both sides to bridge the differences that exist right now.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be one -- a role of encouragement, making sure that the parties are able to move forward knowing that the international community supports their efforts to reach a peace agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, you talked about the importance of resolving this conflict of security of the Palestinians and the Israelis.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also been a change of focus, I believe, by the administration, that it very much is in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 national security interest, given its longstanding support of Israel, at a time when the President is reaching out to the Islamic world.\xc2\xa0 How important is resolving this to -- directly to the American national security?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been the United States\xe2\x80\x99 position for decades that continuation of hostilities in the Middle East is inimical to U.S. interests, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have been an active player over the years -- instrumental in the peace treaty that was reached between Israel and Egypt; heavily involved in the engagement between Israel and Jordan as well.</p>\n<p>We recognize that it is not just in the national security interests of Israel and the Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the national security interests of the neighboring states of Lebanon, Syria, other Arab countries, as well as with the international community.\xc2\xa0 It also is something that unfortunately has been used by some organizations to try to rationalize their acts of violence, which under no circumstances can be justified.\xc2\xa0 But we recognize that the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian divide and disagreements can be a source of problems in the region that are directly -- directly affect U.S. interests.</p>\n<p>So this is something that there has been a longstanding U.S. commitment to engage with the Israelis and Palestinians on.\xc2\xa0 Previous administrations have dedicated much effort and energy to this, and the Obama administration is carrying this tradition on.\xc2\xa0 Senator Mitchell has done wondrous work over the last year and a half to lay the ground work so that today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement and hopefully the convening of these talks can take place at the beginning of September.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit more about how the President is staying on top of economic issues on vacation?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s briefing him in person?\xc2\xa0 Are these briefings longer because he\xe2\x80\x99s not face to face with advisors?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say that most of the information that he\xe2\x80\x99s getting is on paper.\xc2\xa0 His economic team back in Washington is sending on memos and important updates on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the economy as they happen.\xc2\xa0 I know that he spent some time this morning with some of those economic memos in particular.</p>\n<p>And while he\xe2\x80\x99s here he\xe2\x80\x99ll of course pick up the phone and call members of his economic team, and if at any point during the trip it makes sense to read them out, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that that\xe2\x80\x99s the way key way he\xe2\x80\x99s getting his information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, the Tax Relief Coalition, this group of a thousand companies, are saying that letting tax cuts expire is going to hurt business, small businesses in particular.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything to say about that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t respond to the specific comments from this group that I\xe2\x80\x99m just now hearing about.\xc2\xa0 But I will say the President\xe2\x80\x99s feelings on this are that the people who need relief right now are middle-class families, and what we need to do is get help to small businesses so that we\xe2\x80\x99re creating an environment where those businesses can create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal yesterday had a report that the President commented on, showing that the big problem in our economy is that the people who can create the most jobs aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get the resources they need in order to bring on new folks, pay for benefits and that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has been talking about the small business bill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he thinks that as soon as the Senate gets back, Republican obstruction needs to stop, they need to get it done, and we need to keep this economy moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back here?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Knoller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Is this on the same topic?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Say again?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Is this on the same topic?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay, because I\xe2\x80\x99d already called on Jackie.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s awkward now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt.\xc2\xa0 I thought she was done.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay, one quick second.</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What contacts, if any, have there been with Senator Kerry amid his trip to Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction to the statement that Hamid Karzai has agreed to let the anti-corruption probe go forward independently?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Obviously the administration is staying very close in touch with Senator Kerry.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the Afghan government\xe2\x80\x99s and President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s continued interest in rooting out corruption in that country, which stands in the way of Afghanistan being able to realize its full potential.</p>\n<p>So this is something that there is regular and constant interaction with our embassy inside of Kabul, but also with Senator Kerry as he has gone out to the region in Afghanistan -- as well as the situation in Pakistan, the very tragic flooding there, and the additional U.S. aid that is going to Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 This is something that Senator Kerry has been also very much involved in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you spoken to Senator Kerry?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I have not personally, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he -- who is he in touch with, with the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 A range of individuals.\xc2\xa0 I would -- on any given day he would be in touch with different types of people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But mostly over there in the embassy and --</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, with the people out there in the region, but also he is a regular interlocutor of General Jones and other individuals at the White House to keep him fully informed and abreast of developments here, but also to make sure that we have an understanding of the engagements and discussions that he has had in the region.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, I know Russia is one of the Quartet.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe Russia\xe2\x80\x99s role in bringing about these -- relaunch of the peace talks?\xc2\xa0 Is Russia playing a helpful role?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Quartet\xe2\x80\x99s statement is -- provides some additional context for the relaunching of these direct talks.\xc2\xa0 Russia also has a very strong interest in seeing the Israelis and the Palestinians reach understandings and agreements on the issues that lie between them.</p>\n<p>So Russia has been engaged in this effort.\xc2\xa0 The President and other senior officials within this administration continue to engage with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 Senator Mitchell pointed out that Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia played a very helpful role in getting to this point.\xc2\xa0 So we see the Russians as partners in this effort as part of the Quartet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not done with him, right?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the last day of the general session of the DNC in St. Louis, Vice President Biden gave a speech today in which he said a couple things I want to get your reaction to, if possible.\xc2\xa0 One, he projected that Democrats would retain control of the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He said \xe2\x80\x9cIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t illegal,\xe2\x80\x9d he would \xe2\x80\x9cmake book on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He also described the previous administration as \xe2\x80\x9cpresiding over a Ponzi scheme that masqueraded as a vision.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he also said that this is not -- \xe2\x80\x9cthis ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d rather, \xe2\x80\x9cyour father\xe2\x80\x99s Republican party.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He called it the past -- or the new Republican agenda in the midterm elections \xe2\x80\x9cthe past on steroids.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with these characterizations of the opposition party, and does it fit within the overall matrix of trying to rise above the day-to-day tit-for-tat of politics?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in total.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you wish you had?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It sounds like it was a great speech, but far be it for me to comment on what the Vice President says.\xc2\xa0 He obviously speaks for the administration.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to -- what was the first quote that you had there?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t illegal,\xe2\x80\x9d he would \xe2\x80\x9cmake book on\xe2\x80\x9d Democrats retaining control of both the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Just on that specific point, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that you guys could probably get a side bet going on that if you wanted to, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a betting man.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard differently.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the House and Senate.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 These midterm elections coming up give the American people a choice about what direction they want to go in.\xc2\xa0 Do they want to keep moving forward with these policies that have helped us to make progress and move the economy in the right direction, help us to make progress to make it stronger to create an environment where people are creating jobs again, or are we going to go back to the policies of the past that have got us into this crisis?</p>\n<p>So of course the President agrees with the notion that given that choice, the American people are going to continue to want to move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he comfortable with calling the Bush administration someone who presided over a Ponzi scheme that masqueraded as a vision?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the speech in and of itself, but far be it for me to comment on something the Vice President said out of context.</p>\n<p>All right, the end?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For Mr. Brennan.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay, Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different topic, there have been reports from some quarters that there is a thawing relationship between al Qaeda and Iran, and there are some concerns that the peace process and this talk of Israel attacking Iran could drag them closer together.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern of you and the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about any efforts by al Qaeda to try to forge relationships with either other groups or with nation states.\xc2\xa0 And we are concerned about certain activities in that region.\xc2\xa0 Iran does border Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There is a flow of individuals in that area.\xc2\xa0 We are expressing our concerns to the countries in the region about the threat that al Qaeda poses.\xc2\xa0 There clearly are, though, some confessional differences between al Qaeda, a Sunni organization, and Iran, which is mainly Shia.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we are not looking very carefully at any types of relationships that might exist between al Qaeda and other entities, be they groups or states.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a growing relationship between the two?</p>\n<p>MR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it that way.\xc2\xa0 I would just underscore the importance of making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to maintain our monitoring of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to try to establish footholds in other areas of the world, as continued pressure is put on them in their safe havens.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Franklin Graham told CNN that President Obama -- the reason so many Americans seem to believe President Obama is a Muslim is because he was born a Muslim, his father was Muslim, the seed of Muslim has passed through the father, he\xe2\x80\x99s renounced Islam, he\xe2\x80\x99s accepted Jesus, but the confusion is because his father is a Muslim.\xc2\xa0 Since he\xe2\x80\x99s a major religious figure in this country, I was wondering if you guys had any response to that.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Far be it for me to comment on someone\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of what some people said in a poll.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say why people necessarily change their mind in this poll.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say why folks even answer the question when pollsters call.\xc2\xa0 But the President is a committed Christian.\xc2\xa0 I think that the American people know that.\xc2\xa0 And Franklin Graham is certainly entitled to his opinion.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you something quick about health care, these allies of the White House that are switching their focus on how they\xe2\x80\x99re presenting the discussion off of reduced costs and on to --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you -- the White House is supportive of, thinks is a good idea?\xc2\xa0 Will this be the President\xe2\x80\x99s message --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Is the White House supportive of the slideshow?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the notion, the idea, the messaging.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at the White House is that the American people want the health care reform to be given a chance to succeed, but know that -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re making sure that folks do know that -- that health care reform includes things like making sure that kids can still get health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition; that young adults can stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 health care for a longer time than they could previously; that consumers are protected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s been a range of polling on this issue, and you see different things in different polls.\xc2\xa0 But overall -- and especially when you look at the specific elements -- people want these reforms to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And if people are given the choice between letting these things move forward, letting them succeed, versus what I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the Republicans, which is that they want to repeal it, people are going to -- people will choose to make sure that this moves forward and that our health care system is in much better shape; that insurance companies aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, and that people are covered and have access to care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be talking about it in these terms of improving upon the legislation, or are we going to see him doing that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the entire slideshow.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports about it.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to continue to talk about it the way that he has talked about it, which is that we settled a hundred-year-old question on whether or not we were going to have health care reform in this country, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forward with implementing it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, back on just the President and his faith in that poll, one of the reasons cited by many is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t often see the President going to church on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Where is the First Family in their decision to find a congregation?\xc2\xa0 Is that still an active search, or have they sort of settled into a way of worship that they do now?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, as -- the President has addressed this some, that by the President choosing a church, it does put undue pressure on that congregation, and it makes it a lot harder for folks to get into the church and to worship without the glare of all you guys coming along with them to be a part of that service.\xc2\xa0 He prays every day.\xc2\xa0 He talks to a wide range of pastors and religious leaders periodically.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in contact with his religious advisor every single day, Joshua DuBois.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to get that kind of spiritual guidance when he can.\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s up at Camp David he obviously attends a chapel there, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said.</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99ll see him in church again.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s been to church as President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll go to church once again.\xc2\xa0 But he is getting spiritual guidance on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on a lighter side, he bought the Franzen novel today.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he reading?\xc2\xa0 Did he read the corrections?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he interested in -- in downtime here in times we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to read.\xc2\xa0 I think that book is probably a good -- is probably a good guess.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure.\xc2\xa0 I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- he brought a series of books.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which ones he\xe2\x80\x99s going to read, or even all the books that he brought.\xc2\xa0 But while he\xe2\x80\x99s here he\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to spend some time playing some basketball out where he\xe2\x80\x99s staying, going to the beach.\xc2\xa0 I have a feeling he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get some ice cream.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a big fan of the ice cream on this island.</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be just like last year where he\xe2\x80\x99ll wake up in the morning and kind of decide what he and the family are going to do that day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also bought \xe2\x80\x9cThe Red Pony.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Was that for him?</p>\n<p>MR.

BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say the difference between last year\xe2\x80\x99s vacation and this year\xe2\x80\x99s is that since his vacation, the automotive industry is back on its feet, health care reform has passed, and the economy is now moving in a different direction than it was moving in before.\xc2\xa0 But his goals for his time here are the same.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, do you get any down time, or is it all work and no play?</p>\n<p>MR.
