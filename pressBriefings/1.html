Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see correction marked by an asterisk below.</p>\n<p>\n\t11:44 A.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good morning, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0You\'ll have to bear with me a little bit today. \xc2\xa0I\'m fighting off one of those nasty summer colds. \xc2\xa0So I\'ll try to keep the sniffling and sneezing to a minimum up here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any statements at the top, Josh, so we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get Zika did you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I hope not. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted to start briefly with the arrest this morning of a D.C. Metro Transit police officer charged with trying to help the Islamic State. \xc2\xa0The first arrest on terrorism charges of a law enforcement officer post 9/11. \xc2\xa0How concerning for the White House is that? \xc2\xa0And do you know anything additional about what investigators are looking at there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, I know that the Department of Justice has issued a rather lengthy statement detailing some of the evidence that they\'ve collected in this case. \xc2\xa0So I\'ll let them speak to the details. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what I would just say more generally is the Department of Justice and law enforcement officials at the FBI take quite seriously the responsibility that they have to protect the American people. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve seen the FBI and U.S. attorneys across the country make announcements about arrests that they have made, and even convictions that they have won against individuals who have sought to support extremist organizations. \xc2\xa0And we\'re mindful of the risk that is posed by homegrown extremists. \xc2\xa0And we know that part of the strategy that is used by extremist groups around the world, including ISIL, is to use social media to try to recruit followers in countries around the world. \xc2\xa0We know that that certainly is true here in the United States, as well. \xc2\xa0And the FBI and the Department of Justice take quite seriously the responsibility that they have to use the relevant resources at their disposal to pursue these investigations and do everything possible to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about Donald Trump\'s suggestion that the election might be rigged against him. \xc2\xa0I know you\'ve talked a lot about one of the reasons that the White House is putting so much effort into the transition planning is because of the importance of the public\'s confidence in continuity of transitions of power here in the U.S. \xc2\xa0So I\'m wondering if the White House thinks that comments like his, particularly when there\'s nothing to back them up, risks eroding that confidence and creates a situation where people -- where you don\xe2\x80\x99t have faith in the confidence of a presidential election.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, I know that this was the subject of some debate at the end of the last presidential election when some supporters of Governor Romney complained of skewed polling. \xc2\xa0So this is not a new claim. \xc2\xa0I would just note that it is often a claim made by people who don\xe2\x80\x99t end up winning elections. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I\'ll just say in general is that the cornerstone of our democracy is the ability of eligible voters, citizens, to cast a ballot and to have it counted. \xc2\xa0And the more that people participate in that system, the more that people participate in that process, the stronger our democracy. \xc2\xa0And the President has made that case not just in front of audiences full of Democrats, he\'s made that case in front of audiences that include people that don\xe2\x80\x99t share his views, or may not even have voted for him in the two previous elections.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President believes strongly that our democracy benefits when more people are engaged. \xc2\xa0And he\'s certainly going to encourage people to engage in that debate. \xc2\xa0You\'ve seen the United States Department of Justice pursue cases in the courts to ensure that the rights of eligible voters are protected when it comes to participating in elections. \xc2\xa0And the President has actually worked in bipartisan fashion, including signing up the lawyer for Governor Romney\'s campaign to offer up advice about what we can do to make it easier for eligible voters to participate in the process. \xc2\xa0And the reason for all of that is the President believes that our democracy benefits when the American people are engaged in that debate and when as many eligible voters as possible cast ballots.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess to put it more bluntly, can the U.S. government provide assurances that this election, at least from a mechanical standpoint, will not be rigged against Donald Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, the President has confidence in the integrity of our electoral process, and everybody else should too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Secretary Jeh Johnson this morning said that one of the things that the U.S. should look into is deeming the election\'s infrastructure part of the critical infrastructure in the country, which should obviously trigger some additional protections and perhaps eligibility for federal funds. \xc2\xa0Is that an idea that the President supports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know this is an idea that other members of the President\'s national security team have also discussed. \xc2\xa0And I think this should be an indication that this administration has placed the highest priority on cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0The administration understands that there are risks in cyberspace, and those risks take a variety of forms. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why the President included in his budget proposal more than a billion dollars to increase our cyber defenses in this country, both to protect the public sector and government networks, but also to more effectively work with the private sector to ensure that critical infrastructure that\'s maintained by the private sector is protected as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, as we\'ve discussed in here many times, Republicans in the Congress refuse to even hold a hearing to discuss the President\'s budget proposal. \xc2\xa0That\'s quite unfortunate and I think raises questions about whether or not they have their priorities in order. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to how important our cybersecurity is in this country, the President and this administration have made that a priority and there are risks out there, but I think the American people can have quite a bit of confidence in our ability to mitigate those risks and to confront that threat.</p>\n<p>\n\tTim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Zika, New York\'s attorney general is targeting companies today that make phony products -- they say they fight Zika but they don\'t. \xc2\xa0How concerned is the administration that some companies might be taking advantage of public fear about Zika and selling these kinds of things?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Tim, at the risk of disappointing the New York attorney general, I have not seen those reports. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that our experts here in the federal government and in state and local governments across the country are very focused on the risk from Zika. \xc2\xa0And we would encourage people who are concerned about that risk to consult their doctor, to consult the publically available resources, either from state and local public health officials or even from federal officials at the CDC. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe CDC has been working very effectively with local public health officials across the country to meet this threat. \xc2\xa0So if people have questions about steps they can take to protect themselves or members of their family from the Zika virus, we would encourage them to consult the experts and to follow that advice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Zika also, can the administration act without Congress to relax some of the restrictions on some of the pesticides that have been restricted over the years to fight Zika?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I would say about this is that the administration is going to continue to rely on the advice of experts at the EPA and at the CDC in determining what is the most effective way for us to try to fight mosquito populations that could carry this virus. \xc2\xa0And I know that our public health professionals and environmental experts have determined that in some places -- in South Florida, for example -- aerial spraying for mosquitos could help limit the size of the mosquito population that carries the virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re willing to consider a range of options to implement effective what\'s called vector control measures -- essentially trying to fight the mosquito population. \xc2\xa0In some cases, it does raise questions about environmental safety. \xc2\xa0It does raise scientific questions about how effective certain chemicals are against this particular mosquito species that carries the virus. \xc2\xa0So we\'re mindful of all those questions and we\'ll certainly rely on the advice of experts in making decisions about the most effective strategies to deploy to fight the mosquito population.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And organophosphates have been mentioned as one pesticide that could be relaxed. \xc2\xa0Is that one of the options?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s not clear to me exactly what assessment the EPA has made about that specific chemical, but you can ask them about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just lastly on Zika. \xc2\xa0In Florida, we\'re finding out just how hard it is to fight. \xc2\xa0I mean, the mosquitos can breed in a bottle cap full of water. \xc2\xa0What other steps can be taken, even if more money got to the fight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have known since January that this is a particular species of mosquito, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is a tough one to fight. \xc2\xa0As you point out, it can thrive in a very small amount of water. \xc2\xa0It can reproduce rather quickly. \xc2\xa0And, obviously, it is a carrier of this virus. \xc2\xa0So the President and his team have been planning for months now. \xc2\xa0It\'s unfortunate that Republicans in Congress have not stepped up to the plate to play their role in providing necessary funding to ensure that we\'re doing everything we possibly can to protect the American people from the Zika virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you already know that there are emergency response teams that have been deployed by the CDC to South Florida to work closely with local officials in this effort. \xc2\xa0Fortunately, in a place like Florida, there are public health professionals who have experience in fighting mosquito-borne diseases. \xc2\xa0The mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country, and so when it comes to countering not just the Zika virus but things like Dengue and Chikungunya, there is an expertise that is already in South Florida that understands what\'s necessary to try to fight those mosquito populations and limit the risk to American citizens in those communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo they\'re very focused on this effort. \xc2\xa0The support that can be provided by the federal government can come in the form of additional resources to fight mosquitos. \xc2\xa0It can also come in the form of providing researchers who can help track the spread of the disease. \xc2\xa0This includes widespread testing to determine who exactly has it, where they are, and how they may have gotten it so we can take appropriate steps to contain the spread. \xc2\xa0There\'s also work that needs to be done as it relates to expanding the capacity of labs across the country to do tests of diagnostics. \xc2\xa0There\'s also important work to be done as it relates to developing vaccines.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe NIH earlier today announced that they had begun phase 1 trials of a particular Zika vaccine. \xc2\xa0That\'s good news. \xc2\xa0The bad news is we already know that they will not be able to begin phase 2 testing if Congress doesn\'t act. \xc2\xa0And if Republicans continue to obstruct funding for the Zika virus, then that\'s going to limit our ability to rapidly develop the kind of vaccine that next summer or the summer after that could start protecting the American people from the Zika virus and limit the risk associated with this particular disease.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, Republicans in Congress have a lot of explaining to do. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t think there\'s going to be a lot of sympathy for their position. \xc2\xa0They left on a seven-week recess a day early, at the height of mosquito season, and have basically told the American people good luck. \xc2\xa0And I think the American people expect a lot more from their government, and they certainly expect a lot more from their elected members of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the irony here is that the states that are at greatest risk are those states that are overwhelmingly represented in Congress by Republicans. \xc2\xa0It makes the Republican position on this issue all the harder to explain, let alone justify. \xc2\xa0So the response that you\'ll see from the federal government is going to continue to be robust. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to continue to work effectively, even with Republican officials in Florida, to try to protect the people of Florida from this virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt some point, Republicans in Congress are going to have to fulfill their responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you talk a little bit about the report in the Journal today of the pallets of cash that went to Iran? \xc2\xa0Obviously, the cash, the amounts were talked about and reported on at the time -- that\'s not a surprise. \xc2\xa0The detail of the procuring the amount in foreign currencies and putting them on a plane and flying them in on the same day that the hostages were being released, prisoners were being released is what seems to be causing a lot of reaction. \xc2\xa0Donald Trump tweeted that it\'s a big scandal. \xc2\xa0Other Republicans have said that it essentially proves that you guys were paying ransom directly for the folks that were released. \xc2\xa0So what do you guys have to say about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, not a whole lot different than we said six months ago, Mike, as I appreciate you pointing that out in the context of your question. \xc2\xa0I know that this is actually -- I think you devoted a significant portion of your weekend back in January to covering that story. \xc2\xa0So you have my continuing sympathies for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut listen -- so you guys know the facts here. \xc2\xa0But for those who are flailing in an attempt to justify their continued opposition to the deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I\'ll review the facts. \xc2\xa0The facts in this case are I guess two relevant ones, and then we can pursue others that you feel like we need to discuss. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is, this $400 million is actually money that the Iranians had paid into a U.S. account in 1979 as part of a transaction to procure military equipment. \xc2\xa0That military equipment, as it relates to this $400 million, was not provided to the Iranians in 1979 because the Shah of Iran was overthrown. \xc2\xa0So that was the right decision. \xc2\xa0It\'s also why it was hard for the United States to make an argument in this case that we could just keep the money. \xc2\xa0So what the United States did was resolve a longstanding claim at The Hague that saved the American people potentially billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, as it relates to the details, the fact of the matter is the United States does not have a banking relationship with Iran. \xc2\xa0And the reason for that is that the administration -- the Obama administration -- has kept in place tough financial sanctions against Iran because of a variety of concerns that we have about their behavior, including their support for terrorism, their violation of human rights, and a ballistic missile program that they maintain that continues to be inconsistent with U.N. Security Council regulations -- resolutions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the facts of this are quite clear. \xc2\xa0And again, I think it\'s an indication of just how badly opponents of the Iran deal are struggling to justify their opposition to a successful deal that has prevented and continues to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But can you just respond to two specific instances, though? \xc2\xa0One is, was this money ransom for the folks that were released?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it was not. \xc2\xa0It is against the policy of the United States to pay ransom for hostages.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was this a coincidence?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mike, here\'s -- again, we talked about this in January, too, so let\'s talk about this. \xc2\xa0There was a conscious, strategic decision that was made on the part of the Obama administration as we were implementing the deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon to resolve other longstanding concerns that we had with Iran. \xc2\xa0And that included securing the release of five American citizens who had been unjustly detained in Iran and closing out a longstanding financial dispute in a way that saved the American people potentially billions of dollars. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this all came to a head at the same time because we were addressing and resolving longstanding concerns with Iranian behavior. \xc2\xa0And the benefits are almost too long to mention, but the highlights are: \xc2\xa0Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon; Iran has had to scale back significant aspects of their nuclear program; Iran released five Americans who were unjustly detained on Iranian soil; and we resolved a 35-year-old financial claim with the Iranians in a way that saved Americans potentially billions of dollars. \xc2\xa0There are many other benefits we can get into as well, but those are the highlights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One other thing, and then I\'ll let my colleagues go. \xc2\xa0But you cited the sanctions on Iran, the banking sanctions on Iran because of concerns of terrorism and all of that that are still in place. \xc2\xa0There are people who say, yeah, but handing over a pallet full of cash is actually less secure. \xc2\xa0I mean, that money could be handed off and distributed to terrorists potentially with even less ability to track, ability to know what\'s being purchased -- arms, other things. \xc2\xa0So was the White House at all concerned that they were essentially handing the Iranians a pot of untraceable money that is potentially going to fall into the hands of people who we don\xe2\x80\x99t like very much, or doing things that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, so let\'s just review. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned earlier, the United States continues to have concerns with some of Iran\'s nefarious activities. \xc2\xa0But the CIA Director just last week addressed concerns that had been raised by critics of the deal about how money that Iran has received since January has been spent in Iran. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to ruin the surprise here, but the Iranian government has spent the money largely in the way that we expected that they would. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the international community worked together to impose sanctions on Iran because of their nuclear program, their economy suffered. \xc2\xa0So it makes sense that when Iran got revenue as a result of the Iranian agreement, for example -- the nuclear agreement, for example, they used that money to prop up their currency that had been significantly devalued by the sanctions regime. \xc2\xa0We also know that when Iran was subject to all these sanctions, they were not able to finance infrastructure improvements. \xc2\xa0Their infrastructure was crumbling. \xc2\xa0So we know that they used a revenue from sanctions relief to start investing in infrastructure. \xc2\xa0We also know that they had significant debts that they were unable to pay, and they were eager to repay those debts, and that, frankly, their creditors were eager to collect. \xc2\xa0So --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically how that specific pile of cash, literally, was used -- do you? \xc2\xa0Do you know how specifically that money was spent by the Iranians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, it\'s Iranian money. \xc2\xa0And I think what is true from all of the money that Iran has received since January, including from sanctions relief -- which actually, as we know, is more than $400 billion [million]* -- it\'s much smaller than the hundreds of billions of dollars that critics of the deal predicted, but we can get to that in a little bit too. \xc2\xa0The analysis that we\'ve done confirms what we predicted -- is that, largely, that money was spent to address the dire economic condition of the nation of Iran. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President was quite forward-leaning, in advance of the nuclear deal even being completed, in acknowledging that we know that Iran supports terrorism. \xc2\xa0We know that Iran supports Hezbollah and the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0And it certainly is possible that some of the money that Iran has is being used for those purposes too. \xc2\xa0That\'s precisely why this administration, on the front end, has been deepening our engagement with our partners in the Middle East to counter those activities; to more effectively interdict illicit materials that could be used to support Iran\'s ballistic missile program; to more effectively strengthen the defenses of our partners to counter Iran\'s nefarious activities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the bulk of the money we know has been going to shoring up their economic weakness. \xc2\xa0And that\'s exactly what we predicted. \xc2\xa0What has not happened, and where the critics of the deal get it wrong, is Iran has not enjoyed hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. \xc2\xa0Iran has not been able to use hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief to support terrorism or to prop up the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0People who have made that prediction were either badly misinformed or lying to the American public. \xc2\xa0And I\'ll leave it to them to explain why their prediction didn\xe2\x80\x99t come true. \xc2\xa0It does explain, however, why they continue to resurface six-month-old news stories to try to justify their opposition to an agreement that has benefitted the American people, both financially and when it comes to our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I got a couple for you following up on my colleagues\' questions. \xc2\xa0A question about cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0Could you lay out your degree of concern or lack thereof about the integrity of voting machines, given that we\'ve talked now a lot of hacks and about cybersecurity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think anybody who\'s watched "Scandal" on ABC -- (laughter) -- would recognize that this makes for an interesting storyline. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is Kerry Washington going to walk out --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the point here, Olivier, is that elections are conducted at the local level, and there are government officials in cities and counties all across the country that are responsible for administrating elections. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to generalize given the varied nature of election infrastructure in this country. \xc2\xa0There are some places that still use paper ballots. \xc2\xa0Presumably, those can\'t be hacked. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are other places that do use electronic voting machines. \xc2\xa0They have a variety of -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of different software that is used. \xc2\xa0So the point is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the federal government to offer support to state and local governments as they seek to take appropriate steps to protect the integrity of elections.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tI guess you might also say that that varied infrastructure and those different systems also pose a pretty difficult challenge to potential hackers. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to identify a common vulnerability throughout the system. \xc2\xa0But that also poses -- so I think people can take some solace in that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, it also means that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put forward a blanket prescription for securing those systems. \xc2\xa0But certainly the federal government is committed to working with state and local officials to protect a wide range of critical infrastructure that\'s operated at the local level.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you say that these concerns have not risen to the level of the President. \xc2\xa0You talk about the local responsibility, that\'s true. \xc2\xa0But, for example, DHS has a lot of relationships with local governments --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- on things that properly devolve to them. \xc2\xa0So you\'re not aware of a request from a particular state asking DHS for help in securing their systems?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can\'t speak to all those conversations. \xc2\xa0I think what I would go back to is I guess what somebody raised earlier, which is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team has acknowledged that we should consider the benefits and propriety of essentially labeling our electoral system in this country as part of critical infrastructure that is subject to additional protections that can be provided by the federal government. \xc2\xa0So that\'s something that is being actively considered by the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team. \xc2\xa0And presumably if there\xe2\x80\x99s an announcement about that, it would come from the Secretary of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We are blessedly past the conventions. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Which also means that now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for transition work. \xc2\xa0I was hoping you could lay out a little bit about the degree of cooperation that this White House is engaged in with the Clinton and Trump camps.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Olivier, at the end of last week, the White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, placed telephone calls to designated officials on both campaigns to make them aware of the variety of resources that can be used to benefit their transition-planning activities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President made clear at the beginning of this year that one of his goals for the year, one of his top goals for this year was to ensure a smooth transition from the Obama administration to the next President. \xc2\xa0And President Obama has talked before about how this administration benefitted significantly from the effective planning of President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s White House. \xc2\xa0And even though that transition took place across party lines, the effective coordination is something that benefitted the incoming President and the American people more generally. \xc2\xa0And the President aspires to meet, if not exceed, that very high standard that was set by the Bush White House. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do know that there is office space that the GSA has made available to the campaigns\xe2\x80\x99 respective transition teams. \xc2\xa0The much-discussed process of ensuring that the officials -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that the candidates themselves receive an intel briefing from the Director of National Intelligence, that process is now available to the candidates. \xc2\xa0They have to schedule the timing of that briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there also will be an opportunity for officials from the respective campaigns to now be a part firsthand of more official discussions about the transition-planning process that will include a wide variety of government officials. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we can get you some more details on those kinds of meetings. \xc2\xa0But this process has been initiated by the President because the President has made it a priority to ensure a smooth transition to the next President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0Does the President\xe2\x80\x99s finding that Trump is unfit for office have any impact on transition, intelligence briefings, any other kind of preparations for the possibility that he might win in November?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0The fact is, this administration is committed to working both effectively with the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee to ensure that once the American people have made a decision about who should lead our country, that that transition can take place smoothly.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That was my question. \xc2\xa0How can there be a smooth transition if the President thinks that Donald Trump is unfit? \xc2\xa0How can you -- there must be some overcompensation that has to happen in this transition relationship. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If he\xe2\x80\x99s unfit, how can there be a smooth transition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what we\'re planning for right now, Ron, is we\'re planning for a smooth transition. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the responsible step that you would expect the Commander-in-Chief to undertake. \xc2\xa0And the President is committed to engaging in that process across party lines in the same way that his predecessor did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is there like additional staff that\'s -- you understand the logic of this? \xc2\xa0If you think that the other party can\'t do this job, then how can you possibly work with them to transition into something that you don\'t think he can do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, right now, Ron, we\'re not planning to transition with them. \xc2\xa0We are planning for a transition. \xc2\xa0And we are incorporating both campaigns into that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe kind of question that you\'re asking is a legitimate one, but I think is one that probably is more relevant once the American people have decided who the next President should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Iran thing, you kept referring to how much money -- how much money has Iran received in sanctions relief?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the latest assessment that has been made about this. \xc2\xa0What I do know is that there had been predictions prior to the commencement of the deal from critics who suggested that Iran could get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. \xc2\xa0That\'s false. \xc2\xa0They were wrong. \xc2\xa0And were they just informed or lying? \xc2\xa0You\'d have to ask them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0But again, you were giving a fairly -- you were giving an accounting that seemed based on something that -- X went to debt relief and infrastructure, and so on and so forth. \xc2\xa0So how much went to -- how much didn\'t go to terrorism, and how much did go to terrorism if you have this accounting of -- if you\'re so confident that you know that the money primarily went to debt relief and infrastructure, and so on and so forth?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I was actually citing the comments of the Director of the CIA. \xc2\xa0So you can certainly check the intelligence community or the Treasury Department for a specific number.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the point is, you don\'t know how much they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten in sanctions relief or really where it\xe2\x80\x99s gone.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, Ron, the point is right now that we do know how Iran has spent a lot of that money. \xc2\xa0And the amount of money that Iran has received is far less than what critics predicted. \xc2\xa0So they were either wrong or lying. \xc2\xa0You can go ask them.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we do know is that Iran was quite concerned about the state of their economy. \xc2\xa0That was the whole strategy that we put in place from the start. \xc2\xa0We recognized that the international community was fractured over how to deal and confront Iran and their growing nuclear aspirations. \xc2\xa0So the United States demonstrated some leadership. \xc2\xa0President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and other people had to represent the United States, get the international community to agree to apply significant pressure to Iran and their economy. \xc2\xa0The strategy worked. \xc2\xa0Iran\xe2\x80\x99s economy struggled. \xc2\xa0The value of their currency plummeted. \xc2\xa0They went into a recession because we were able to coordinate with the rest of the international community to apply this pressure. \xc2\xa0So Iran was desperate for sanctions relief so that they could address this economic weakness in their country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we know that they used this money to invest in infrastructure, to try to pay off their economic debts that they were saddled with, and to try to shore up the value of their plummeting currency. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the administration is not concerned about the amount of money that Iran has spent to finance terrorism post-Iranian -- post-nuclear deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Pre-Iranian nuclear deal, the President made clear that we continue to be concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nefarious activities in the region. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the United States has deepened our coordination with our allies and partners in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0To counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities, we\'ve beefed up and strengthened our interdiction efforts to prevent Iran from being able to expand on their ballistic missile program. \xc2\xa0We\'ve sought to deepen our cooperation even further with Israel because we know how Iran seeks to menace our closest ally in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0So we\'ve acknowledged on the front end that we continue to be concerned with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nefarious activities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that was pointed out to me today -- and I\xe2\x80\x99d actually forgotten this -- the day after, or two days after this agreement was announced, that weekend in January, later that week, the United States announced additional sanctions against Iran because of their ballistic missile program, as I recall. \xc2\xa0So we\'ve been serious from the beginning about making sure that we are taking appropriate steps to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s various nefarious activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the $400 million that was the tribunal settlement -- the whole amount, as I recall, was $1.7 billion. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Where\xe2\x80\x99s the other $1.3 billion now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that $1.3 billion is essentially what was subject to negotiation in terms of how much interest accrued on this money. \xc2\xa0So that is why I make the case to you -- and other senior administration officials have done the same, including back in January -- that the American people saved potentially billions of dollars because of this smart deal that was reached.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right -- the estimate was $10 billion or something, as I recall, that the United States could have been liable for. \xc2\xa0But the question is, where is the $1.3 billion, less the $400 million, that\'s already -- has the rest of it already gone to Iran, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You have to check with the Treasury Department in terms of whether or not that other payment has been made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\'s significant, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? \xc2\xa0Why can\'t the administration be more transparent about -- and this is the concern raised by the reporting about the pallet and the cash. So why --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\'t know how much more transparent the President of the United States can be than to call all of you into the Roosevelt Room, I believe it was, on live national television, and announce the fact that we have reached an agreement with Iran. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know how much more transparent we can be than to have the Secretary of State of the United States on January 17th issue a standalone written statement that\'s headlined, "Hague Claims Tribunal Settlement." \xc2\xa0It\'s seven paragraphs long and it explains exactly the deal that was reached. \xc2\xa0So we have been quite forward-leaning in terms of explaining to the American people how they benefitted from this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So has Iran received the rest of this more than a billion dollars or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You need to check with the Treasury Department in terms of how these transactions are conducted. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you, Ron, is that when the United States makes an agreement and we make a commitment to make a payment, we\'re good to our word.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the other thing on Iran, how many American citizens are now in Iran -- Iranian custody, post Iran nuclear deal? \xc2\xa0Because the reporting and the suggestion from the Iranian media base -- some of it, in reading that -- is that this is happening because a ransom was paid, because there was this coincidence.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be clear, I never called it a coincidence. \xc2\xa0We confronted that before.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah, the question is -- there are other Americans who are now being held prisoner by Iran. \xc2\xa0What is the administration doing about that? \xc2\xa0And do you see a connection to the Iran deal from January?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of things here. \xc2\xa0The first is that I\'m not in a position to talk publicly about the cases of individual Americans if they have not signed a privacy waiver. \xc2\xa0So we protect the privacy rights of American citizens around the world. \xc2\xa0So I\'m quite limited in what I can say about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\'s also true is that in discussing the cases of Americans who are unjustly detained or being held hostage, we have often found that it is not helpful to name them, to detail them, to identify them specifically. \xc2\xa0So let me just say that we have continuing, longstanding concerns with Iran\'s treatment of American citizens in Iran. \xc2\xa0And that is why an agreement -- again, announced back in January -- that prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, that reached a financial settlement to save the American people potentially billions of dollars, and secure the release of five Americans that had been unjustly detained in Iraq was hailed as such a positive, beneficial outcome for the United States. \xc2\xa0But let me be clear: \xc2\xa0The United States does not pay ransoms. \xc2\xa0The only person that\'s making that accusation, at least included in The Wall Street Journal story that we\'re talking about, is some Iranian official. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, it\'s actually Paul Ryan is doing it now and --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Marco Rubio --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They are now. \xc2\xa0So it sounds to me like they are once again in a position where they\'re making the same argument as hardliners in Iran in an effort to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement. \xc2\xa0The President made clear a year ago that right-wingers in the United States were making common cause with right-wingers in the Iranian government. \xc2\xa0And, again, if they\'re doing it again to try to justify their opposition to an agreement that has benefitted the American people, they can do that, but I think that\'s going to be pretty hard for them to explain. \xc2\xa0Maybe there\'s another letter from Senator Cotton to the Supreme Leader we don\'t know about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just this last -- can you confirm or deny that the money arrived the day that the Americans left?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can\'t confirm the details of the specific transaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you can\'t say anything about the remaining balance of this hundreds of millions of dollars that the United States has agreed to pay to settle the tribunal issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I can -- I can\'t provide a specific update for you in terms of the transaction. \xc2\xa0I can tell you when the United States makes a commitment, we\'re good for our word and we live up to the terms of the agreement that we signed onto.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I think a lot of us reported on that transfer at the time -- $400 million to the Iranian account, $1.3 from taxpayers, coming from the Treasury. \xc2\xa0But in terms of the logistics of this, there are some in Congress, including Ed Royce who has written an exchange letter to the State Department asking for more granularity on that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0A vowed opponent of the Iran deal continuing to try to justify his opposition to this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But as you would say, these are actually three separate deals. \xc2\xa0This isn\'t about the nuclear report, this isn\'t about prisoners, you\'re arguing; this is its own deal. \xc2\xa0So if we put those two aside and we just focus on this deal, specifically with the money transfer, will you be providing that detail to Congress, knowing that you can\'t tell us from the podium, as you just said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, we\'ll continue to engage with members of Congress about this. \xc2\xa0I think what is true -- and I think would certainly account for the descriptions that were included in the newspaper today -- is that the United States does not have a banking relationship with Iran. \xc2\xa0And the reason for that is because of this administration\'s commitment to ensuring that we continue to hold Iran accountable for a variety of activities that we are deeply concerned about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that\'s logical in terms of not refuting the idea that it had to be a cash payment since there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any banking accounts, and that now that the banking system is a little less clogged, you could find other ways to pay, so maybe the timing suggests once again it\'s around the same time. \xc2\xa0Do you understand that -- I\'m sure you appreciate that without the clarity on this, the innuendo and the optics make it tough, so to truly kill that idea and the allegations being made of a ransom payment. \xc2\xa0So why not provide that detail of exactly how the money was received?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\'s a lot of rationality in the argument that you\'ve outlined that is being made by hard right-wing officials in Iran and Republican critics of the deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That taxpayers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know how the $1.3 billion of their money was --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, no, no. \xc2\xa0No, no, no. \xc2\xa0I\'m talking about as it relates to this suggestion that somehow this was a ransom payment, that this is somehow connected to other elements of the deal. \xc2\xa0The only people who are making that suggestion are right-wingers in Iran who don\xe2\x80\x99t like the deal, and Republicans in the United States that don\xe2\x80\x99t like the deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it would be very easy for you to kill that argument by saying this is exactly how it happened and why -- not just "trust us, there\'s nothing shady about a plane arriving in the middle of the night loaded with cash" -- which you\'re saying innuendo, right? \xc2\xa0You\'re saying there\'s nothing that was done that was not above board. \xc2\xa0So why not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, Margaret -- I guess the point that I\'m trying to make, Margaret, is we could not possibly have been more transparent about this arrangement than to have the President of the United States announce it to all of you on live national television on the day that the agreement was reached.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The day the agreement was reached and intent to pay the $1.7 billion, yes. \xc2\xa0But the details -- you\'re saying yourself it\'s new detail and an old story. \xc2\xa0I guess clarifying the detail is what would help clarify it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But why is that relevant? \xc2\xa0Why is that relevant? \xc2\xa0Particularly when we all know that there\'s no banking relationship between the United States and Iran. \xc2\xa0So again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re talking about the cash transfer --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yeah, I understand -- again, I understand the political attacks that are being made by people who are trying to justify their opposition to our engagement with Iran. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But at a minimum, the $1.3 billion is taxpayer money. \xc2\xa0So don\xe2\x80\x99t people have a right to have an answer to that question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, that\'s why we announced it, as you point out, back in January.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the details of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And what are the details?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Those transfers from the trust fund to this bank, to this bank, or it had to be in euros and francs because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a banking relationship because it\'s complicated. \xc2\xa0Like, that would be a really simple thing that people would be able to follow.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So, look, I guess none of what you have walked through changes the basic facts there. \xc2\xa0We acknowledged, again, back on January 17th, that there would be all kinds of innuendo hurled by people who oppose engagement with Iran -- Republicans in the United States who oppose engagement with Iran. \xc2\xa0I recognize that the details that you\'re seeking to elicit might make for a colorful news story, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t change the facts. \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t actually change any sort of innuendo that\'s going to be lobbed by critics of the deal about our intent. \xc2\xa0They certainly are not going to effectively convince, again, a right-winger in Iran who\'s seeking some kind of propaganda victory in the pages of The Wall Street Journal from basically making a false claim that this somehow is a ransom payment. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can tell you is that the United States, when we make an agreement, we live up to it. \xc2\xa0We announced the terms of this agreement back in January. \xc2\xa0The reason we announced the terms of the agreement in part is because we have a desire to be transparent with the American people. \xc2\xa0We also have a desire to advocate for the fact that because of this smart agreement, the American people potentially saved billions of dollars. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you say this is completely politically motivated?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, the facts of this case, the facts of this situation and the benefits of this situation have been known for more than six months now. \xc2\xa0You all have been reporting on it for more than six months ago -- again, not because of some secret anonymous leak in the bowels of some government bureaucracy, but because the United States of America announced it on live television from the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know we\'ve all been covering it. \xc2\xa0But the thing that\'s new is the detail that you\'re saying is irrelevant. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why it becomes a sticking point in the conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I recognize it\'s my job to answer that questions up here, but I will acknowledge I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand -- other than for the fact that it makes for a colorful lead, I\'ll concede that -- but it\'s doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the facts of the situation. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change anybody\'s assessment about the motive of the United States whether or not this was wired from one particular U.S. government account to some Iranian government account, as opposed to delivered on pallets. \xc2\xa0That\'s not going to change the argument of Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio that they\'re opposed to the deal. \xc2\xa0It\'s not going to change the propaganda efforts of the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, they\'re opposed --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re linking them all.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because they are.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\'re saying they\'re not linked.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because they are. \xc2\xa0I\'m saying, the argument that they\'re making -- that is false, that has been proven wrong time and time again -- is not going to change based on whether this was wired or delivered in paper currency. \xc2\xa0So that -- so I understand the interest in details for a more colorful story, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what this does to the broader outlines of an argument that have been in place for six months now. \xc2\xa0Republicans have lost that argument, critics of the deal have lost this argument, because we have succeeded in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0We did succeed in securing the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained overseas in Iran. \xc2\xa0And we did succeed in saving the American taxpayers potentially billions of dollars by reaching a longstanding financial settlement with the Iranians over their money.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re just arguing that it\'s all worth it, basically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the details don\xe2\x80\x99t matter on this, is what you\'re saying.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not been quoted saying that, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be quoted saying that. \xc2\xa0I think what I\'m saying is, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the contours of the argument. \xc2\xa0The argument that is being made by Republicans is they\'re struggling to justify their opposition to our engagement with Iran. \xc2\xa0They\'ve lumped it all together. \xc2\xa0We have made clear time and time again that we capitalize on this opening with Iran to try to settle this variety of claims. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there is no disputing, despite the best efforts of right-wingers in Iran and right-wingers in the United States, that we have prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, they have rolled back key aspects of their program, we did secure the release of five Americans, and we have settled a longstanding financial claim in a way that benefits the American people, potentially saving billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, nothing like this will happen to secure the release of the four Americans that are U.S. residents who some of their families have said are being held in Iran and the Iranians have said they\'re being held? \xc2\xa0I know you can\'t talk to those specific cases.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I will say is that the United States, under President Obama, has not paid a ransom to secure the release of Americans unjustly detained in Iran, and we\'re not going to pay a ransom. \xc2\xa0If there are Americans who are unjustly detained in Iran, we will make a case regularly through some now-established channels with Iran to advocate for their release.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This financial dispute you mentioned has been going on for 35 years. \xc2\xa0Why was it necessary to airlift in the pallets of cash on the very weekend that the American prisoners were released?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, Scott, the reason is simple. \xc2\xa0The United States does not have a banking relationship with Iran. \xc2\xa0So --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That explains that it was cash, but it doesn\'t explain the timing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because we reached the agreement and Iran wanted their money back. \xc2\xa0So, again --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They waited 35 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right, so you might expect that they would be eager for them to get their money back. \xc2\xa0Again, this all stems from a payment that Iran had made into a U.S. account related to a military sale that didn\'t actually go through. \xc2\xa0The military equipment wasn\'t provided. \xc2\xa0So, again, you could understand why they\'re quite eager for the money.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou also would understand that they\'re quite eager for the money when you consider that the value of their currency has plummeted, that they haven\'t been able to invest in infrastructure, that they\'ve got debts that need to be paid, and that they\'re in the middle of a recession. \xc2\xa0So at the time, they were eager to try to address the legitimate concerns of the Iranian people about the state of the Iranian economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And why was the U.S. government so eager to pay --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why was the U.S. eager to deliver the money so quickly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I would not describe the United States as eager -- I would describe the Iranians as eager. \xc2\xa0I think what the United States is, is we\'re a country that lives up to the commitments that we make. \xc2\xa0And that\'s exactly what we did. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\'s been called a ransom payment by Iran. \xc2\xa0That\'s not exactly surprising. \xc2\xa0But would those prisoners have been released had this payment not been made at the time that it was? \xc2\xa0And so it isn\'t essentially a ransom payment then, even if the U.S. does not view it that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0It is not a ransom payment. \xc2\xa0The United States does not view it that way, and it\'s not accurate to describe it that way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So would those prisoners have been released then if this money hadn\'t been paid then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what is true is that there were a team of negotiators -- let me just start from the beginning. \xc2\xa0What I know is true is there were a team of negotiators in the United States that were interacting with Iranian officials to secure the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran. \xc2\xa0That negotiating work was successful and those Americans are at home.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was a separate group of negotiators who were working through The Hague process for decades to try to reach an agreement, a settlement, on these financial claims. \xc2\xa0And there was momentum in our relationship where we were closing out accounts, where we were resolving longstanding concerns. \xc2\xa0And in each case, the United States reached agreements and closed out accounts in a way that benefitted the American people. \xc2\xa0And whether that is preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon or rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program or securing the release of five American citizens who were unjustly detained there, or reaching an agreement on a longstanding financial claim made by the Iranians about Iranian money in a way that saved the United States taxpayers potentially billions of dollars -- there are a lot of benefits to this deal. \xc2\xa0And we talked about them back in January with a lot of transparency. \xc2\xa0You all reported on it. \xc2\xa0And, again, the motive of people who want to talk about it again seems to be to just drum up innuendo in an effort to cover up the benefits of all of these agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think a lot more people find this interesting than just people who are opposed to it. \xc2\xa0But, again, would those prisoners have been released then if this money had not been paid then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that our negotiators who were talking with the Iranians about what was necessary to secure the release of American citizens in Iran succeeded. \xc2\xa0That was different than the group of negotiators who were involved in The Hague negotiating with their Iranian counterparts to settle these longstanding financial claims.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So because U.S. policy is opposed to ransom payments, even if it were only for the appearance of this not being a ransom payment, why would you not have made Iran wait even a week longer? \xc2\xa0I mean, why would Iran\'s eagerness to get their hands on their money be more important than making sure that this was not a quid pro quo that was based on the exact timing being right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the answer to that is pretty obvious, which is that even a week delay would not have prevented Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio from falsely claiming that they\'re a ransom. \xc2\xa0Because, Michelle, come on, I saw you sigh. If we announced this financial settlement on the same day that the prisoners were released, that\'s fodder to our Republican critics. \xc2\xa0I get that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But everything is fodder.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, exactly. \xc2\xa0I couldn\'t have said it better myself. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No one is questioning that. \xc2\xa0It\'s an election coming up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s fine.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It works both ways.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t think it works both ways.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it was a pretty simple question. \xc2\xa0Would those prisoners have been released --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just say one thing about this --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- if the money wasn\'t paid on that same weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I guess what I\'m saying is it\'s a pretty simple negotiation that took place, which is you had a group of negotiators who are interacting with their Iranian counterparts to secure the release of five American citizens. \xc2\xa0It is a different group of negotiators who are involved in trying to reach this settlement at The Hague. \xc2\xa0I think at some point the premise of your question is predicated on a decision that was made by Iranian officials. \xc2\xa0So I guess I would wish you the best of luck in trying to get an answer from them about what decision that they would have made.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me tell you one other thing, though, as it relates to sort of waiting a week. \xc2\xa0It certainly wouldn\'t have prevented Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio from falsely accusing us of paying a ransom. \xc2\xa0But here\'s the other key thing. \xc2\xa0It also would not have prevented right-wingers in Iran from falsely seeking a propaganda victory by making the same argument. \xc2\xa0So that\'s why -- again, to go back to Margaret\'s line of questioning --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We already said none of that is any surprise.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0None of it is a surprise but it also is a good illustration I think of how the outlines of this argument haven\'t changed in six months. \xc2\xa0So there may be some more details that make for good newspaper copy, but they don\'t change the facts of this situation and they don\'t change the rationale for the argument that we have been making about the variety of ways in which the American people have benefitted from this series of agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\'s no harm in putting second eyes on something when some new detail has put it back in the public view. \xc2\xa0I mean, nobody is questioning that anything really has changed. \xc2\xa0It\'s just, you know, why not ask again? \xc2\xa0There\'s no harm in that. \xc2\xa0Anyway, just quickly -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t stood up here and said that you guys shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be asking the questions that you are. \xc2\xa0I welcome the opportunity to talk about all of the ways in which the American people have benefitted from our interactions with Iran. \xc2\xa0I think what I do take some umbrage at is the suggestion that somehow this is new evidence that proves that a ransom was paid. \xc2\xa0That\'s false. \xc2\xa0It was false when that accusation was made in January, it is false when that accusation is made in August, and it is false when that accusation is made in light of facts that don\'t change the calculation, either on the part of the President or anybody else who has a view on this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How helpful would you say Iran has been in determining where Robert Levinson is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\'t have an update for you in terms of the conversations that we\'ve had with the Iranians about that. \xc2\xa0What we have indicated, as a part of that agreement that secured the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran, is Iran made a specific commitment to cooperate with our efforts and to share information with the United States that could potentially lead to the rescue of Mr. Levinson. \xc2\xa0But I\'m not able to speak to the status of those ongoing talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Despite the sharpening of my axe for a while, to dive into that topic everybody else has pretty much touched on it, so I\'m going to switch gears a little bit and talk Russia. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0You guys did a great, job by the way. \xc2\xa0Thank God, right? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President mentioned a tough relationship, obviously, with Russia and in particular with President Putin. \xc2\xa0I\'m just wondering, how concerned is the White House, sort of to follow up on an earlier question, about the possibility of Russian hacking impacting not just our election but more broadly our infrastructure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, the United States has been concerned for some time about Russia\'s nefarious activities in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0And Director Clapper discussed this in his -- the Worldwide Threat Assessment that he delivered to Congress earlier this year. \xc2\xa0He said, "Russia is assuming a more assertive cyber posture based on its willingness to target critical infrastructure systems and conduct espionage operations, even when detected and under increased public scrutiny." \xc2\xa0Secretary Carter has talked about Russia\'s nefarious activities in cyberspace as well. \xc2\xa0He noted that earlier this year, the censors that guard DOD\'s unclassified networks detected Russian hackers accessing one of our networks. \xc2\xa0And you\'ve heard Lisa Monaco, who is the President\'s top counterterrorism advisor and somebody who is focused on homeland security, talk about how cognizant the Obama administration and the U.S. government is of Russia\'s activities in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe understand that there is a risk, a threat that Russia poses in cyberspace, and this is something that we have raised with them in a variety of channels and we\'ve made clear that we have some concerns. \xc2\xa0So there are a variety of things that we have done in response. \xc2\xa0We haven\'t just raised it with Russian officials. \xc2\xa0The President more than a year ago designated additional authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to allow him to impose financial sanctions against entities or individuals who are involved in hacking in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0That is a capability that the U.S. government didn\'t previously have, but it is something that we have used before and could potentially be used in preparing a proportional response to cyber threats.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we have worked to do is to work with the rest of the international community, including through the G20, to try to arrange the international community around a set of international norms. \xc2\xa0And the President made reference to this in his comments yesterday that innovation in cyberspace and development of capabilities in cyberspace has outstripped the international community\'s ability to establish rules of the road and norms when it comes to appropriate conduct in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0And so we need to do the important work of building international momentum around agreeing to those kinds of norms. \xc2\xa0That will help us and be effective in enforcing those norms and holding people accountable for violating them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When the President has a conversation with Vladimir Putin or other leaders and you say that he\'ll have an exchange -- and he even said yesterday, he said, add to the laundry list, effectively, of the problems of disagreements that I might have -- does he get specific about if you do X, or if you continue to do X, we will be forced to do Y? \xc2\xa0And I ask the question because people wonder often, when he\'ll make a comment and he\'ll say, you know, we have raised that with our counterparts or we\'ve discussed this with our counterparts -- they are always looking for more meat on the bone in that respect. \xc2\xa0You kind of touched on it a bit. \xc2\xa0Can you expand on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have any additional insight to shed on private conversations between the U.S. President and the President of Russia. \xc2\xa0But I do think I can faithfully tell you that the President has been very direct and other U.S. officials have been very direct in talking to their high-level Russian counterparts about our concerns about Russian activities in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0Those are well-known.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose concerns are well-known, their activities are something that have been well-documented. \xc2\xa0Their capabilities are something that U.S. officials have been talking about publically for quite some time. \xc2\xa0So the Russians are well aware of our concern, and they\'re well aware of our capability when it comes to potential responses.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut just to make sure that people don\'t misinterpret what I said, I want to be clear that the FBI has not announced any specific conclusions about their investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t want any of this conversation to be construed as applying to that specific case. \xc2\xa0Our discussion relates to our broader concerns about Russia\'s activities in cyberspace, and they\'re not commenting with regard to one specific case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last thing -- I guess I can take maybe a small swing at it -- would you at least acknowledge the wince-some appearance going back to this payment -- the wince-some appearance of payment goes out, people who are held captive come home? \xc2\xa0Maybe it was just timing, granted, but would you at least acknowledge that it doesn\'t look great?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, if that was a legitimate concern, it is a concern that would have been raised six months ago when we originally announced it. \xc2\xa0That\'s why I\'m quite skeptical of the integrity of the reaction that we\'ve seen from people who have long been on the record of opposing our efforts to engage with Iran. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, despite their opposition and despite their criticism, we have succeeded in rolling back key aspects of Iran\'s nuclear program and preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and securing the release of five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran, and settling a longstanding financial dispute in a way that potentially saves American taxpayers billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They keep plucking American -- Iranian Americans. \xc2\xa0Do we have any of their citizens?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not quite sure what you mean by saying "have any of their citizens." \xc2\xa0There are any number of Iranian Americans in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I meant specifically they seem to be -- the government seems to be kidnapping Americans -- kidnapping Iranian Americans over there. \xc2\xa0Are we doing anything in response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can\'t speak to any individual case for the reasons that I outlined earlier. \xc2\xa0What is true is that when there were Americans who we believed were unjustly detained in Iran, Secretary Kerry acknowledged when he was having daily meetings with his Iranian counterpart in the context of the negotiations to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0He raised U.S. concerns about that unjust attention every single day.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this the status of Americans held against their will around the world is a top priority of the U.S. government, and there are significant efforts and significant resources that are committed to seeking the recovery of Americans who are unjustly held or held hostage around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0If I can circle back to Iran briefly. \xc2\xa0Is it your contention that it is not a ransom payment because there was no quid pro quo or because it was Iranian money that was flown in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is our contention that there was no ransom paid to secure the release of U.S. citizens who were being unjustly detained in Iran because, A, it\'s against the policy of the U.S. government to pay ransoms. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that we told the Iranians that we would not do. \xc2\xa0We would not -- we have not, we will not pay a ransom to secure the release of U.S. citizens. \xc2\xa0That\'s a fact. \xc2\xa0That is our policy and that is one that we have assiduously followed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said the timing -- you refused to describe this as a coincidence also. \xc2\xa0Regardless of whether this was a ransom, was the timing a concession to allow the Iranian regime to save face or to gain a symbolic propaganda victory? \xc2\xa0Was that something that factored into the U.S. calculation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We talked about this calculation back in January. \xc2\xa0And what we said back in January -- I stood at this podium on January 19th and we talked about this. \xc2\xa0The timing is predicated on the ability to resolve a variety of concerns that we had with Iran. \xc2\xa0Iran was signing off on deals and we got them to sign off on a deal that released five Americans who were unjustly detained in Iran. \xc2\xa0We got them to sign off on a deal that rolled back key aspects of their nuclear program and prevents them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0We got them to sign off on a deal that would resolve longstanding financial concerns -- our longstanding financial dispute that, yes, that returned $400 million of Iranian money but that also saved U.S. taxpayers potentially billions in interest charges. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo all that came to a head at the same time because we were focused on capitalizing on this opportunity to complete these agreements. \xc2\xa0And the benefits of those agreements are quite difficult to argue with. \xc2\xa0I recognize it doesn\'t prevent our critics from trying to do so in a partisan, political way, but when it comes to our national security and when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, when it comes to the safety of American citizens abroad, when it comes to saving taxpayers billions of dollars, those are the kinds of things that should rise above politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Switching topics. \xc2\xa0The President said in March at the South by Southwest Festival about voter registration online and online voting, he said: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe can pay our taxes, we can hold up our phone at the supermarket to pay with our credit card, but somehow online voter registration is perceived to be insecure...\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Given that there is potential meddling by a foreign government in our election process, is it still his contention that online voter registration and voting does not raise significant concerns of the security of our elections?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think you may be taking some editorial liberties with the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments there. \xc2\xa0I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s comment speaks very well for itself. \xc2\xa0The chief obstacle that we had seen to modernizing and making the voting registration and ballot casting process more efficient is Republicans who have no interest in making it easier for people to participate in our democracy. \xc2\xa0In fact, we actually see Republican intentionally erecting barriers to participation because somehow they believe that that allows them to enjoy a political benefit. \xc2\xa0That\'s rather disappointing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact that banks have been hacked does not prevent anybody in this room from accessing their checking account online. \xc2\xa0The point is we place a high priority on addressing threats in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0And the risk associated with this is not a reason to remain in the 20th or 19th century when it comes to our voting system. \xc2\xa0It actually is an argument for a more robust and more technologically sophisticated investment in our voter registration and vote tabulating system. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve made that case forcefully, and the President will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on online voting and online voter registration is that it is something that should be looked at.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is our view that there is a way for us to use technology to make it easier for eligible voters to register to vote and cast a ballot. \xc2\xa0And we should be trying to capitalize on technology that makes it easier for our citizens to participate in democracy. \xc2\xa0That certainly is true. \xc2\xa0There obviously are a number of technical questions that are raised. \xc2\xa0But we should confront those questions and we should address them because the President believes that our democracy is stronger when more people are able to participate. \xc2\xa0And if we make the process more efficient and more convenient, the President believes more people will.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you mentioned that you told the Iranians that the U.S. government doesn\'t pay ransom. \xc2\xa0Did they ask for one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to speak to any requests that were made the Iranian government. \xc2\xa0You can check with them. \xc2\xa0But if they were to have asked, the answer would have been no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, and on a different subject. \xc2\xa0North Korea fired two intermediate-range ballistic missiles yesterday, one of which landed in Japanese waters. \xc2\xa0Is there anything about the target of these launches or the proximity to them getting a nuclear-armed ballistic -- developing of a nuclear-armed ballistic missile that would change your calculus in how you approach this? \xc2\xa0As I understand it, you\'re going to go back to the U.N. and Pyongyang is going to ignore whatever sanctions come out of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me go through the details here. \xc2\xa0The U.S. Strategic Command systems detected what we assess were two North Korean launches yesterday at about 7:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time. \xc2\xa0Initial indications reveal one of the missiles exploded immediately after launch, while the second was tracked over North Korea and into the Sea of Japan. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are the details. \xc2\xa0You saw the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations announce today our intent to convene an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council with Japan to discuss this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe continue to believe -- the United States continues to believe that our response to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities is stronger when the international community remains united. \xc2\xa0So that\'s why the United States continues to work so closely with our partners at the U.N., with our allies like Japan and South Korea, and with countries like Russia and China to try to counter this activity and try to urge, impress upon the North Korean government the need to stop these kinds of missile launches that are destabilizing to an already volatile region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we continue to be concerned about this, but we continue to place a high priority on our effective coordination with the international community. \xc2\xa0In order to apply additional pressure on the North Korean government, we\'re going to need to work effectively with the Russians and the Chinese to get that done. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what we\'re committed to doing. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Final question. \xc2\xa0Do you have -- is there a public estimate about how long it will take before North Korea has a nuclear-armed ballistic missile?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of an updated intelligence assessment on this that\'s been presented. \xc2\xa0But let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s some additional information that we can provide on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, three different subjects. \xc2\xa0Going back to Iran, what other options were on the table from the consideration of making this payment to fulfill your obligation and also in light of the recession that\'s happening in Iran? \xc2\xa0You said something about the week later. \xc2\xa0Were there other timelines on the table when you were trying to figure out how to make this payment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The weeklong delay is a hypothetical that Michelle raised, and I think was a good illustration because it indicates that the logistics involved in this transaction don\'t at all change our desire to resolve a longstanding financial dispute with the Iranians that saves the American people potentially billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t know what else was considered in terms of the logistics, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that doesn\'t affect both our desire to resolve this dispute, it also doesn\'t affect the way in which the American people benefitted from the resolution of this dispute.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Next subject. \xc2\xa0Going back to something earlier in this briefing, Denis McDonough and the efforts for the transition for both campaigns for whomever is going to be President of the United States. \xc2\xa0How was Denis McDonough received from the Trump camp? \xc2\xa0This was days before President Obama said that Donald Trump was unfit. \xc2\xa0But we understand, everyone knows that there is disdain in both camps -- or maybe that might be too harsh a word -- there is no love lost between both sides. \xc2\xa0How was Denis received by the Trump camp?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I can tell you is that Denis was fulfilling a responsibility that President Obama had given to his team to prioritize planning for an effective transition come November. \xc2\xa0And so I can tell you that Denis fulfilled that responsibility seriously because the President has made it a priority. \xc2\xa0How the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s representative may have responded to that call, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you think he fulfilled -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in that -- he fulfilled his responsibility. \xc2\xa0But was he able to adequately fulfill his responsibility? \xc2\xa0Was there a blockage? \xc2\xa0Did it go smoothly? \xc2\xa0Was he able to pick up the phone and meet right away? \xc2\xa0Could you give us a little tick-tock?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was just a telephone call. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any concerns that were raised by the call.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, not serious but significant. \xc2\xa0President Obama has his last birthday as President on the 4th, tomorrow. \xc2\xa0How is he spending his birthday as President -- the last birthday he has as President of the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending at least some of his birthday with all of you when he does a news conference tomorrow at the Pentagon after convening his National Security Council meeting to talk about our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf that\'s something he wanted to do for his birthday -- (laughter) -- is something you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask him tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But if I recall, he had another press conference I think it was last year or the year before on his birthday. \xc2\xa0But let\xe2\x80\x99s go -- sorry, I digress a minute. \xc2\xa0So okay, that\'s for his birthday. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about a party. \xc2\xa0I understand -- I hear that there\xe2\x80\x99s some big planning and some big names coming in for the President. \xc2\xa0Is that true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any updates on how the President is planning to celebrate his birthday, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\'t have any updates, but you do know something, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any details at this point, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted. \xc2\xa0All right? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Earlier today, French President Hollande said that Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexcesses are both sickening.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that. \xc2\xa0And does the President feel that his comment about Trump being unfit for the presidency while sort of standing next to another world leader gives other world leaders an opening to speak out against Donald Trump, as we\'ve seen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, other world leaders are going to make their own decisions about what they share with regard to their feelings about the U.S. presidential election. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll let them do that in the way that they believe is most appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d just point out that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday were in a response to a direct question that he received at a news conference standing next to the Prime Minister of Singapore.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also part of his response was to say that sort of in 2008 and 2012 if McCain or Romney had won, that he\xe2\x80\x99d be disappointed, but he would tell the American people this is the President and I believe this person will be able to uphold the Constitution. \xc2\xa0Was the implication there that if Donald Trump wins, that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to look at the American people in the eye and say, this is your President, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to uphold the Constitution?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t think -- I don\'t think the President was being particularly subtle about the doubts that he harbors. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I also wanted to ask about the DNC. \xc2\xa0A few people were let go there yesterday. \xc2\xa0Has the White House or the President been in touch with the DNC, with Donna Brazile? \xc2\xa0Is the White House satisfied with what you\'ve seen so far in terms of the dismissals?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Toluse, as we discussed, I believe it was last week -- what the White House believes is that the leadership of the DNC should be closely coordinating their activities with the campaign apparatus with the individual who is at the top of the ticket in 2016. \xc2\xa0That person is not President Obama but rather Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the White House has been in discussions with the DNC about some of their activities over there. \xc2\xa0But ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the Clinton campaign to effectively coordinate with the Democratic Party apparatus to integrate their efforts and focus on the upcoming election. \xc2\xa0So ultimately the question about the leadership of DNC is something that they\xe2\x80\x99ll resolve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted to go back to North Korea very quickly. \xc2\xa0And in an interview today, North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s top official dealing with the U.S. warns that relations between the U.S. and North Korea will be dealt with under wartime laws. \xc2\xa0And he specifically said that includes the detention of the two American prisoners who are being detained there. \xc2\xa0Does the U.S. have any word that these Americans are being mistreated or abused, or concern about their treatment going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we obviously are concerned about the status of U.S. citizens that are unjustly detained in foreign countries, including in North Korea. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve made the case to the North Korean government about appealing for their release. \xc2\xa0There are obviously specific channels through which we can do that because the United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea. \xc2\xa0But we certainly are making efforts to pursue the release of U.S. citizens that are being unjustly detained in North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the rhetoric that we\'ve heard from the North Koreans, I think it is in indicative of their destabilizing approach to the region. \xc2\xa0And U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea have encouraged North Korea to abandon that overheated rhetoric and those destabilizing activities. \xc2\xa0China and Russia have done the same. \xc2\xa0So ultimately, our case is strengthened, our hand in strengthened, in compelling the North Korean regime when we work effectively with the international community. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the reason that Ambassador Power will be working at an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to coordinate on an international response. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Zika really quickly, you said that Republicans need to act to pass funding. \xc2\xa0But since the outbreak in Florida has been announced, has the President made any personal outreach to congressional leadership to discuss this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, congressional leaders aren\xe2\x80\x99t in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0He can. \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any specific conversations to tell you about right now. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that the President has been on the phone with the governor of Florida to ensure that federal officials are coordinating effectively with state and local officials to make sure that we\'re mobilizing an effective response. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans in Congress know everything they need to know to make a decision about whether or not they\'re going to fulfill their responsibility to do their part to protect the American people from the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0Thus far they haven\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0And if they\'re going to change their approach, we hope they\'ll do it soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, tomorrow is the counter-ISIL meeting at the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0I realize this is one of the regular series the President has been having at the agencies. \xc2\xa0To what extent does this one have to do with the air campaign that\'s begun in Libya this week, in and around Sirte?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mark, I can tell you that this meeting was scheduled before those airstrikes were conducted. \xc2\xa0But I\'m confident that U.S. activities in Libya, at the invitation of the Libya government, will be a part of the briefing that the President receives, because it\'s an important part of our efforts to prevent ISIL from establishing a safe haven anywhere in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How long is this campaign going to go on? \xc2\xa0Are we looking at days, weeks, months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Are you talking about the situation in Libya? \xc2\xa0Or just --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The campaign in and around Sirte.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the Department of Defense has put a timeline on it at this point. \xc2\xa0But obviously our activities in Libya are in support of a ground force that is acting on the orders of the Libyan government. \xc2\xa0And the actions that the United States has taken in Libya come at the request of the Libya government. \xc2\xa0And moving forward, all our activities in Libya will continue to be closely coordinated with the central government there. \xc2\xa0So I guess that\'s a long way of saying that the timeframe will certainly be dependent upon the preferences and requests that are put forward by the Libyan government.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0I really appreciate it. \xc2\xa0I have a question about Pope Francis, what he said. \xc2\xa0But I\'m a rare guest these days, so I\'ll ask a couple of things about Russia. \xc2\xa0Number one, you are concerned about -- Americans are held abroad. \xc2\xa0Are you aware that there are American prisoners in Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think you have to check with the State Department in terms of determining the case and determining what we can say publicly about this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah, the question is -- there are a couple of Russians, at least, held in the U.S. who basically have been kidnapped, brought here from third countries. \xc2\xa0The Russians today -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why today -- mentioned that they offered a swap, a prisoner swap, to the Americans. \xc2\xa0They publicly said that. \xc2\xa0They hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said that before. \xc2\xa0Are you aware of that offer? \xc2\xa0And what in general -- what is your attitude to such ideas of prisoner swaps?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what cases you\'re specifically referring to when you mention the Russian citizens there. \xc2\xa0I can confidently tell you that the U.S. government has not been involved in kidnapping any Russian citizens. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who would make that kind of claim, but there\'s no evidence for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Viktor Bout and Yaroshenko, the pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, who were (inaudible) one in Thailand and the other in Liberia, brought over here and put on trial and put in American jails. \xc2\xa0Those are the two cases.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I would encourage you to check with the Department of Justice to get the facts on that case. \xc2\xa0It sounds like it might be worth you doing so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Secondly, since you were talking about this campaign against ISIS, will we be bombing al Nusra together anytime soon? \xc2\xa0Because Secretary Kerry and Minister Lavrov seem to agree on this, but today at the Pentagon, they asked Peter Cook, and he basically there are -- no, I\'m sorry it was not Cook, it was the General from the battlefield. \xc2\xa0He said that no preparation was being done in terms of intelligence. \xc2\xa0So will we be bombing al Nusra together?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrei, the case that we have made directly to the Russians is they should use their special influence with the Assad regime to enforce a cessation of hostilities to get back to a place where the Assad regime, with the support of the Russians, is not attacking innocent civilians. \xc2\xa0And that\'s not happened. \xc2\xa0And that is a violation of commitments that Russia made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities. \xc2\xa0And that has prevented -- frankly, it\'s exacerbated a humanitarian situation because it has prevented an increase in humanitarian assistance that can be provided. \xc2\xa0It has exacerbated the political situation around the diplomatic talks that we\'ve been working together to try to facilitate because opposition leaders don\xe2\x80\x99t want to come and sit at the negotiating table with the Assad regime as long as the Assad regime that\'s being aided and abetted by the Russian government is carrying out attacks against civilians that they supposedly represent. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the truth is, the United States continues to be concerned both about the failure of Russia and the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Cessation of Hostilities, but also about the continued presence and activities of extremist organizations inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And we have said for quite some time that we would welcome Russia not using their military might to buck up the Assad regime, but rather to focus entirely on going after extremists. \xc2\xa0And if they were prepared to do that, the United States would be prepared and our coalition partners would be prepared to work more effectively with them. \xc2\xa0But thus far, Russia has refused to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the truth is -- the question right now is one that relates directly to the credibility of Russian leaders. \xc2\xa0Are they going to live up to the commitments that they\'ve made? \xc2\xa0And if so, we can begin doing the important work of more effectively coordinating our efforts to go after extremists that we know threaten both our countries. \xc2\xa0And the continued efforts of the Russians to prop up the Assad regime only makes it easier for extremists in Syria who we know thrive on chaos to bolster their positions in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess the Russians would say that the biggest priority is going after the extremists. \xc2\xa0Do you agree with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We certainly believe that the priorities should be placed on going after extremists. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, the conduct of Russian military activities has been inconsistent with that claim; that Russian military activities have devoted significant time and attention and resources and energy to supporting the Assad regime, and to further --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Against who?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Against opposition fighters in Syria. \xc2\xa0The point is that the more that they do that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The moderates.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Excuse me?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The moderate opposition fighters. \xc2\xa0But there are no moderate opposition fighters. \xc2\xa0That\'s the point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The point is, Andrei, as long as the Russian military continues to buck up the Assad regime, it only foments greater chaos in Syria. \xc2\xa0It only makes a diplomatic resolution and a political transition, that President Putin himself said is necessary, farther off into the distance. \xc2\xa0And the farther off that political transition is in the distance, the more chaos there is in Syria in the near term. \xc2\xa0And that chaos is something that we know extremist organizations thrive upon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why we believe that Russia should live up to the commitments that they have made, enforce the Cessation of Hostilities, not devote so much energy and attention to fortifying the Assad regime, and actually working more effectively with the international community to go after extremists. \xc2\xa0Once Russia has demonstrated a commitment to actually doing that, then I would be much more optimistic about the ability of the United States and Russia to work more effectively together inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, my general question about a very interesting comment that Pope Francis made. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you can answer it right away. \xc2\xa0If you take my question, I\'m fine if you give me an answer later. \xc2\xa0Pope Francis basically said peace is lost -- which is striking. \xc2\xa0We all remember when -- and I\'m not saying that it\'s like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, President Obama\'s fault, but we all remember that President Obama, when he was first elected, was immediately given this Nobel Peace Prize, which reflected at least like the hope of all the world that we\'ll have some peaceful future ahead of us. \xc2\xa0And now, at the end of the Obama presidency, the Pope says peace has been lost. \xc2\xa0And when we look at Europe, when we look at the Middle East, when we look at the United States, we cannot say that peace is here. \xc2\xa0So basically my question is, how do you explain that? \xc2\xa0Why has peace been lost on President Obama\'s watch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I will say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the assessment in the way that you portrayed it. \xc2\xa0So I think I\'d take a closer look at Pope Francis\'s comments and see if we can get you a response.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:14 P.M.
