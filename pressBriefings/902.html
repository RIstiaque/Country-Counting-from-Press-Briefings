EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have anything off the top.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have a series of fundraisers, many of which you will cover over the course of the day today.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements.\xc2\xa0 If you want to -- so you can go ahead and get started.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the update on Secretary Bryson?\xc2\xa0 Do we have any better idea of what happened to him and what\xe2\x80\x99s the prognosis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you saw last night, Secretary Bryson had a statement indicating that he ended up taking a medical leave of absence.\xc2\xa0 Before leaving the White House this morning, the President had an opportunity to speak to Commerce Secretary Bryson on the telephone, where they had a short conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President encouraged Secretary Bryson to focus his thoughts on his own health and on his own family.\xc2\xa0 And the President indicated his confidence in Dr. Blank, who is somebody who could lead the Commerce Department in Secretary Bryson\xe2\x80\x99s absence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you said he did express confidence in him?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Dr. Blank.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In Dr. Blank -- as somebody who could lead the Commerce Department in Secretary Bryson\xe2\x80\x99s absence.\xc2\xa0 And the President encouraged him to focus -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak up a little bit, I apologize.\xc2\xa0 And the President encouraged Secretary Bryson to focus on his own health and getting that care and medical treatment that he needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is there any update as far as exactly what the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s condition is or what type of seizure he had?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on those factual details about what happened over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, the medical tests that Secretary Bryson will undergo are related to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was this the first time they had an opportunity to speak, the President and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Since the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, since the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Since the weekend, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you go over a little bit more of the tick-tock beginning with when was the White House first informed of the incident?\xc2\xa0 And the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t informed until Monday morning.\xc2\xa0 How come the gap in time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot -- I mean, you have the details right, that the White House was informed late in the day on Sunday and the President was briefed on Monday morning.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of more details, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot more light to shed on those details at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it -- Jack Lew talked to him when?\xc2\xa0 Sunday or Monday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that Mr. Lew spoke to him on Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Monday morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To Bryson?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To Bryson, Monday morning.\xc2\xa0 And so it was -- and the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t informed until Monday morning.\xc2\xa0 So it was<br/>\n\tLew --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Lew had decided it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him until Monday morning, so the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t informed until Monday morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on Monday morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t know why there was a lag on why Bryson didn\xe2\x80\x99t report in or what happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we know who -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if Mr. Lew called him later in the day to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the minute-by-minute tick-tock.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we -- what Jay broadly discussed yesterday in terms of the tick-tock is -- continues -- is an accurate portrayal of the events over the last 72 hours or so.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details to add to that beyond the President\'s phone call to Secretary Bryson this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a medical leave of absence is unusual.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t Secretary Bryson decide to step down, fully resign?\xc2\xa0 And do you have a timetable for his return?\xc2\xa0 Does the President expect him to return?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for his return, primarily because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pre-judge what the results of a medical examination that was referred to in the statement last night might reveal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what the President -- I can reiterate to you what the President reiterated to the Secretary this morning, which is that his -- that the Secretary\'s attention and interest and priority at this point should be his own health.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you say why he chose to take a medical leave versus just agree to resign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to that at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it suggested to him by anyone that he take a medical leave?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You have to refer to -- you have to check with the Commerce Department on what went into his decision, in terms of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you know if Lew or anyone else in the White House suggested to him that it would be a good thing to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Even if I were privy to the conversations that took place, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to share about them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s sort of open-ended for when he can return as far as the President is concerned.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true, primarily because the time that he\'s taking here will be devoted to his -- an examination of his health and some medical tests.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s going to take the time that he needs to focus on those priorities, those things that should be his priority, those things along with his family.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\'t Bryson himself that informed the White House on Sunday night?\xc2\xa0 Or was it someone else?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we\'ve gotten into the details about who was on either end of the phone during those conversations, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like his return hinges on the results of his medical exam.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pre-judge into all of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who notified the White House initially, Sunday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I just said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on who participated in those phone calls.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an idea of today, like what will happen today?\xc2\xa0 And will the President -- what is the tone that he\'ll take today?\xc2\xa0 He\'s had a rocky -- some might say a rocky time lately.\xc2\xa0 Will he sort of be redefining his message a bit?\xc2\xa0 Will he be able -- can you talk about what he plans to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think much of what you\'ll hear the President talk about today over the course of the fundraisers, both in Baltimore and in Philadelphia, is the President laying out what he views as a very important debate for us to have in this country about what kinds of economic policies should be put in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is, as we\'ve discussed extensively, a pretty stark difference between the vision that\xe2\x80\x99s being articulated by the President\'s Republican opponent.\xc2\xa0 That is a vision that is characterized by the same kinds of policies that were put in place by the previous administration that led to a pretty significant economic downturn and a pretty significant spike in our federal budget deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has a different approach.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we need to adopt a balanced approach in dealing with our deficit challenges, and that includes important and significant cuts in federal spending, including the largest -- including the cuts that he\'s already enacted, which have brought our discretionary spending down to the lowest levels since the Eisenhower administration as a percentage of GDP, but also making important investments in innovation, in infrastructure, in energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that is the key to strengthening our economy, both in the short run, but also laying the kind of foundation that we need to ensure the economic strength of our country in future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat represents a pretty stark difference in the approach that\xe2\x80\x99s being advocated by the Republicans in Congress and by the President\'s Republican opponent.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that we\'ll have over the course of the next five months.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll hear the President flesh out those themes in his remarks over the course of today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he revisit the private sector and the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By addressing his remark Friday.\xc2\xa0 Will he say anything about it at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you can certainly expect to hear the President talk about the proposals that he has forwarded to Congress.\xc2\xa0 This would include additional tax cuts to small businesses to encourage them -- to give them an incentive to hire new workers.\xc2\xa0 There are other proposals that the President has talked about in the American Jobs Act and the State of the Union about allowing small businesses to expense capital purchases and other kinds of tax benefits that would help small businesses grow and expand and hire more workers.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can certainly hear the President talk -- again, expect to hear the President talk again about his proposals that were paid for, that would put construction workers back to work rebuilding our infrastructure, rebuilding our roadways and runways and bridges, and modernizing our schools.\xc2\xa0 You can certainly hear the President -- expect to hear the President talk about his proposals, again, fully paid for -- the kinds of things that have earned bipartisan support in the past, that would support state and local governments as they seek to rehire teachers, put police officers and firefighters back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis grouping of ideas that the President described as the American Jobs Act were projected by economists to significantly strengthen our economy and add up to 1 million jobs to the -- to add 1 million jobs to our economy.\xc2\xa0 So these are the kinds of ideas that we believe that Congress should act on, and we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for Republicans in Congress to explain why they haven\xe2\x80\x99t acted on them.\xc2\xa0 I think that certainly there are a lot of questions in the minds of the American people, middle-class families out there who are struggling, who bear a very significant burden in this difficult economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, the President has put forward a plan that would allow responsible homeowners to refinance their homes.\xc2\xa0 Some of them are underwater, and because of red tape are prevented from refinancing their homes at these historically low interest rates.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans in Congress would act on the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, it would allow these responsible homeowners to refinance their homes, which for the average homeowner would save them up to $3,000 over the course of this year.\xc2\xa0 That would certainly offer a significant boost to our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a number of things that can be done, a number of things the President has proposed that have been sitting on the doorstep of Congress for months now.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s time for them to act.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that you can expect to hear the President talk about that today as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what did you -- what did the administration think of the Fed report on personal wealth?\xc2\xa0 It showed that a median family net worth in 2010 was no more than it had been in 1992.\xc2\xa0 Does that give the President\xe2\x80\x99s critics ammunition --</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I think I would say about that is, is that this is obviously a pretty powerful illustration of something that the President has talked about extensively over the course of the last three years, which is that we went to a significant -- went through a significant and painful economic downturn, the likes of which we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is an illustration also that that downturn had a significant impact on middle-class families, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why so much of what the President has advocated are policies that would strengthen our economy, but also the ability of middle-class families to go out there and get a good job, to afford their mortgage, to save for retirement, to send their kids to college.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of these are the kinds of investments that the President is advocating.\xc2\xa0 All of these are the kinds of things that would lighten the burden of middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And too many of these are policies that have been blocked by Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 That is the nature of the debate that we\xe2\x80\x99re having.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that this -- it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible, and I think that you could say that we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that this colorful illustration would prompt Republicans in Congress to abandon their political tactic of obstructing everything that the President has proposed -- or at least the vast majority of the things the President has proposed -- and pass some policies that would bring some relief to middle-class families that is long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, any updates on phone calls or briefings that the President has had regarding Greece and what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Europe?\xc2\xa0 And then also, secondly, Holder and what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Hill with the June 20th vote for the contempt -- any updates on phone calls and briefings on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any phone calls to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 As has been the case for quite some time now, administration officials have been in contact with their counterparts in Europe, and they continue to be, about the kinds of steps that members of the eurozone can take to strengthen their monetary union.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the hearing that Attorney General Holder participated in today, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been following some of the news reports as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been traveling here for the last hour.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific reaction to the contempt vote that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to other than to point out to you that I believe that today was Attorney General Holder\xe2\x80\x99s ninth trip to Capitol Hill to testify before Congress; that there are more than 7,000 pages of documents -- 7,000 pages of documents have been released as a request of Congress, as a part of that investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd my colleagues at the Department of Justice have also indicated their willingness to continue to cooperate with legitimate oversight efforts.\xc2\xa0 But it does -- all of this I think illustrates something that maybe you do -- would find newsworthy, which is that I do happen to agree with Congressman Steve King, which is, his observation that this is nothing more than politics.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in today\xe2\x80\x99s news or in today\xe2\x80\x99s hearing that will prove Congressman King wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President doing anything to support Ron Barber in the special election to -- for Gabby Gifford\xe2\x80\x99s old seat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 You might check with the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign on that front.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s -- he called \xe2\x80\x9cForward\xe2\x80\x9d absurd.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that a little?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you have specific questions about the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s slogan, then I would encourage you to call the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 However, I would say that there is no question that policies that the President\xe2\x80\x99s opponent is advocating would take us back to the kinds of policies that led to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and would lead to a giant hole being blown through our budget because of a $5 trillion tax cut that is weighted heavily toward those at the top of the income scale.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s an approach that the President believes is wrong; that that approach to take us back is not the right one.\xc2\xa0 The President believes in something that is fundamentally different, that would take us forward, that would strengthen the middle class, in making certain investments in energy and infrastructure and education while adopting a balanced approach to dealing with our deficit challenges, including asking those at the top of the income scale to pay their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are two starkly different approaches.\xc2\xa0 And the observation that what Mitt Romney wants to do is very similar to the approach that was adopted by the previous administration that that takes us back in a different direction than the forward-looking approach the President is advocating.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnything else for this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is kind of late breaking, but it looks like there was some action on Syria.\xc2\xa0 And this may have -- apologies, this may have just crossed.\xc2\xa0 Bulletin -- hang on one second -- the U.N. peacekeeping chief says Syria conflict is now a civil war.\xc2\xa0 The government has lost large chunks of territory in some cities.\xc2\xa0 So I guess anything on the civil war.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific reaction for those comments.\xc2\xa0 Our administration -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard members of the administration come out and say that the Assad regime is being increasingly isolated, even within their own country -- that a lot of this is due to the international pressure that\xe2\x80\x99s being applied by the United States and other -- our allies and partners across the globe and in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that these coordinative actions are continuing to squeeze the Assad regime financially, and making it harder for them to bankroll their brutality.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. and international sanctions have had a significant effect in taking a bite out of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s reserves.\xc2\xa0 So meanwhile, the regime is unable to make any money, and Assad is spending all of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s money to kill the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 So it is apparent that that isolation is only increasing, and the pressure on the Assad regime is getting tighter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in terms of the specific observation that you cited from the U.N. official, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said the size of reserves.\xc2\xa0 Are you talking oil reserves or currency reserves?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about his -- about the financial resources of the country.\xc2\xa0 Right, that the international sanctions that are in place are taking a bite out of the resources that are at his disposal.\xc2\xa0 And currently, he\xe2\x80\x99s spending those resources to fund his war machine that\xe2\x80\x99s attacking and killing the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been awful quiet -- anything on your end?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You good?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 All right guys, thanks for bearing with us in these --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No update in the NBA finals pick?\xc2\xa0 I saw the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say the President will be watching.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:57 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
