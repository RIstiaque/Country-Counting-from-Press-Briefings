EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everyone. \xc2\xa0Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Charleston, where the President will deliver his eulogy at the service later this afternoon. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any announcements at the top, so I\'m happy to move right to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give us a sense of how the President found out about the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage today, his reaction, and the mood in the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I can, Julie. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that as soon as the ruling was out, Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett phoned the President. \xc2\xa0He was in the residence, working on the eulogy for this afternoon, actually -- working on his remarks. \xc2\xa0The President subsequently was in the Oval Office and got a full debrief by Neil Eggleston and and was joined by the Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And his reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think you heard from the President his reaction in the Rose Garden earlier. \xc2\xa0I think he\xe2\x80\x99s very pleased. I think the ruling is consistent with his beliefs \xe2\x80\x93 *inequality in equality -- confirming, as he said earlier, that love is love. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you put this in a broader political context for us? We saw some Republican presidential candidates this morning put out statements after the Supreme Court ruling, basically saying we kind of want to move on from this issue, talking about religious freedom stuff, but not sort of pushing the same kind of constitutional amendment we\'ve seen in the past. \xc2\xa0Do you feel like this moment today is a big pivot point in American politics? Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s still a big split between the parties when it comes to LGBT rights?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\'m going to leave the political analysis to others. \xc2\xa0I do think, as the President said, this was a consequential ruling, one that affirms equality, one that guarantees the right to marriage no matter who you love, and one that\'s consistent with not only the President\xe2\x80\x99s public policy positions but one that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s values.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk about the terror attacks? \xc2\xa0I know the President has been briefed, but can you give us some detail on what the White House knows so far and if there\xe2\x80\x99s any indication that those events around the world are connected?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Angela, I can tell you the President was briefed early this morning on this and continues to receive updates as the situation warrants. \xc2\xa0I can also tell you that our national security staff and our intelligence community professionals are in touch with their counterparts in the respective countries and continue to offer help and assistance to those in those countries. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut obviously these are unfolding circumstances in real time with the attacks happening hours ago. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t have an intelligence assessment to provide at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any sense that the attack in France was because the company that ran that factory was based in the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\'t have specific details from our intelligence community, but I can tell you that our law enforcement officials continue to be in touch with our counterparts in France. \xc2\xa0So as soon as there\xe2\x80\x99s any assessment along those lines I\'m sure we\'ll get it to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any higher-level security alert that you\'re considering or directive that you guys plan to put out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Carol, I would refer you to the Department of Homeland Security, which constantly is monitoring our security protocol back here in the United States. \xc2\xa0But I haven\'t seen anything -- any changes announced on the heels of these attacks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President had a chance to reach out to his counterparts in any of these countries -- President Hollande, for instance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Roberta, I don\'t have any foreign leader calls to read out to you yet today. \xc2\xa0But as you know, the President has actually met recently -- or spoken recently with President Hollande, as well as the leaders of Kuwait and Tunisia in recent weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m asking about today, if he has --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I understand, and I don\'t have any foreign leader calls to read out to you right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s day in Charleston, what his message is going to be in the speech, and then can you tell us if he will meet with the families after?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Julie, I don\'t have a significant amount of preview for you of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks. \xc2\xa0The good news is he delivers those remarks in a few hours so you all will be able to listen for yourselves. \xc2\xa0I do expect the focal point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks to be celebrating the life of Reverend Pinckney, his contributions to the community down there. \xc2\xa0I believe it\'s hard to have an extensive conversation about the tragic shooting in South Carolina without mentioning some of the social issues that we\'ve been talking about over the past week, but, again, I expect the focal point of the eulogy to be about his life.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- list of lawmakers who are on the plane?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I do. \xc2\xa0Speaker Boehner is joining us on Air Force One this afternoon, as well as Congressmen Scalise, Butterfield, Van Hollen, Becerra, Congressman Lewis, Congressman Cummings, and Congressman Price. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you -- for the people back home?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Speaker Boehner, Congressman Scalese, Congressman Butterfield, Congressman Van Hollen, Congressman Becerra, Congressman Lewis, Congressman Cummings, Congressman Price.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll also tell you that there\xe2\x80\x99s a separate aircraft bringing many more congressmen down with us. \xc2\xa0We\'ll make sure you get that full list. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about Cabinet Secretaries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know of any Cabinet Secretaries on this flight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie also asked if the President is going to be meeting with families on the ground in Charleston. \xc2\xa0I can confirm that\'s going to happen and that will happen after today\xe2\x80\x99s service. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Which families?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with the families of those who were tragically lost last week and some of the surviving families.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s first Air Force One trip with the President, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure. \xc2\xa0I\'d have to fact-check that for you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you get back --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\'ll see what I can do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- bring the Speaker back?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I will see if he\xe2\x80\x99s interested. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you a broader question on -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of chatter out there that this is a great day for the President, he\xe2\x80\x99s had a lot of victories. \xc2\xa0He had trade, he had health care. \xc2\xa0And people are crediting him with gay marriage. \xc2\xa0I guess one question is, do you feel like he deserves credit for the gay marriage decision? \xc2\xa0What role does he think he had to play in that? \xc2\xa0The other two are kind of obvious that he had a role in. \xc2\xa0And my question to that is, do you guys feel like this has been a very successful week? \xc2\xa0And if so, how do you feel about that going forward when there aren\'t that many at least domestic policy big-ticket items left for you in the next 18 months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Carol, I do think it\'s been a significant morning, it\'s been a significant couple of days, and it\'s certainly been a significant month for not only the President and the administration, but for the country. \xc2\xa0And if you take a moment to step back, I think the developments we\'ve all experienced over the past few days speak to not only the modern American presidency, but also speak to the reason this President ran for office.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you go back to 2007, you will remind yourselves that principles and values of equality, of expanding health care, making that more affordable, of making sure that health care is a right and not a privilege, making sure that the middle class has all the economic opportunities that we can build for them -- those are the reasons the President ran for office. \xc2\xa0Those continue to be the motivating factors for this President moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you speak to the modern American presidency? \xc2\xa0What do you mean by that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think I just meant given everything that\'s been happening this week -- we\'re on a plane right now down to Charleston where the President is going to deliver a eulogy on the heels of a terrible mass shooting, and the conversation that has stemmed from that both at a national level, also in South Carolina and around the country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- the first mass shooting where the President knew one of the victims. \xc2\xa0Is he more affected by this than others? \xc2\xa0I mean, he was greatly affected by the Newtown shooting as well, but this one he really knew someone personally.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Pam, I am going to defer to the President. \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about his relationship with the Reverend. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to overstate that relationship. \xc2\xa0They met back in 2007. \xc2\xa0The Reverend was a early supporter of the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for the White House. \xc2\xa0He and the First Lady met the Reverend back in South Carolina in the early stages of the campaign. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it to the President to discuss what that means to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can we go back to gay rights real quick, LGBT rights? \xc2\xa0Obviously, we saw a big move today by the Supreme Court, huge, huge advance for people who support LGBT rights expansion. \xc2\xa0There is still some stuff on the table that advocates want to see done -- principally, this open service for transgender members of the military. \xc2\xa0Is the President prepared to just say he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do that by the end of his time in office at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Evan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any policy pronouncements for you today. \xc2\xa0I will say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s overarching value and guiding principle on this is that any man or woman who wants to serve in our military ought to be able to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have one more about today. \xc2\xa0Will the President have a chance to see or visit the church where the tragedy took place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Roberta, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x99s on the schedule for today, but if that changes we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you characterize the tone or tenor of the President\xe2\x80\x99s phone call with Vladimir Putin yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s phone call with whom?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Vladimir Putin.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much to add to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s readout on that. \xc2\xa0As you saw, they discussed a variety of pressing issues, including new developments in Syria, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that Russia start to abide by the Minsk agreements. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Is that it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have one other question. \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that you guys have slowed down your outreach to the Hill on Iran talks while you were trying to push through trade, and that that\xe2\x80\x99s ramping back up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Carol. \xc2\xa0Josh did a little bit of this yesterday, but our outreach to Congress on the Iran deal remains robust and aggressive. \xc2\xa0I know that there are conversations that happen between members and both our national security staff here -- back at the White House, but also with folks at the State Department and also at the Department of Energy. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m fairly confident in telling you that anyone -- any member of Congress who would like -- who has questions or wants a phone call returned will get one. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Oh, week ahead, yes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will host a working dinner with President Rousseff of Brazil at the White House. \xc2\xa0On Tuesday, the President will host a bilateral meeting with President Rousseff of Brazil at the White House. \xc2\xa0That meeting will be followed by a joint press conference. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House. \xc2\xa0And on Saturday, the President and First Lady will celebrate the Fourth of July by hosting military heroes and their families for an Independence Day celebration with a barbeque, a concert, and a view of the fireworks on the South Lawn. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
