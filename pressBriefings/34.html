Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:11 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 After hearing the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments, I think it should be apparent to you what\xe2\x80\x99s on the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind today.\xc2\xa0 It includes, obviously, making sure that we follow through on our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, to continue to press Congress to take common-sense but meaningful gun safety steps that would actually strengthen our homeland security, and also to make sure that even as we are in the midst of an important campaign and political debate across the country, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t confuse political talking points for a counterterrorism strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments largely stand for themselves, but if you have questions on this or other topics I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take them.\xc2\xa0 So, Darlene, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They do stand for themselves, but would you give us a little bit of insight into what it is that led the President to sort of go off at the end of his statement there about Donald Trump -- without naming Donald Trump -- and everything that he\xe2\x80\x99s had to say about Muslim Americans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency, based on those who have been covering this political debate for the last several months, to focus in on one candidate.\xc2\xa0 But many Republicans have been making exactly the case that the President has expressed concern about.\xc2\xa0 It was Governor Bush who initially advocated for a religious test on individuals who are entering the country.\xc2\xa0 It was Senator Cruz who made the reference to enhanced surveillance of Muslim communities.\xc2\xa0 It is Chris Christie who expressed concerns about admitting Syrian refugees to the United States.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- unfortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about one politician in the Republican Party who is reacting out of fear and using language that the President is concerned could undermine our homeland security.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is quite passionate, I think as was evident, about doing what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 He took a solemn oath, twice, in the last seven years, seven and a half years, to faithfully execute the duties of the office of the presidency and to fulfill his number one priority, which is protecting the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that commitment to our national security and to our homeland security, and to making sure that all Americans enjoy that protection is something the President gets quite passionate about, particularly because, as he also discussed, he sees firsthand the substantial commitment and sacrifices that are made by our men and women in uniform, that are made by our men and women in the intelligence community, that are made by our diplomats, that are made by our law enforcement professionals, that are made by officials at the Department of Homeland Security to keep us safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey, too, have taken an oath.\xc2\xa0 They put their lives on the line, many of them every single day, to protect our country.\xc2\xa0 And as the leader of the country and as the Commander-in-Chief, the President feels strongly about making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re executing a strategy that is consistent with the sacrifice that they\xe2\x80\x99re making.\xc2\xa0 And that would explain the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the other candidates that you did mention -- Bush, Cruz, Christie -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve all said things against Muslim Americans, but Donald Trump is the Republican presidential -- presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so to be clear --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is the loudest voice out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem.\xc2\xa0 That is the problem.\xc2\xa0 There is a tendency to just reduce this to one person, and that is to deny the reality about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another question, regarding the Orlando shooting, Governor Scott of Florida said earlier today that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard from the President since Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans for him to reach out to Governor Scott, given that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to Florida on Thursday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the President has had the opportunity to speak with Buddy Dyer, who is the mayor of Orlando.\xc2\xa0 Other senior White House officials have been in touch with Governor Scott directly, and there have been a number of conversations between Obama administration officials and their counterparts in Florida to ensure that we are effectively coordinating the efforts of federal authorities with state and local authorities as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that is an important principle here, to make sure that all our efforts are concentrated on investigating this situation, getting to the bottom of it, but also standing in solidarity with a community that\xe2\x80\x99s grieving.\xc2\xa0 And, as we announced last night, the President will be traveling to Orlando on Thursday. \xc2\xa0And, as we always do, we will invite the governor to be a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully the President will have the opportunity to see Governor Scott there.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The DNC has said it was hacked by Russian hackers.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how concerned the President is about this.\xc2\xa0 Has he been briefed about it?\xc2\xa0 What do you make of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I do not know at this point whether or not the President has been briefed, but this administration obviously takes our cybersecurity -- our nation\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me discuss before, there is actually a very specific proposal included in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget to enhance our cybersecurity, including by increasing resources that are dedicated to that pursuit.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs has been well-documented, Republicans, for the first time in 40 years, have declined to even hold a hearing on that specific budget proposal, which means that the President has put forward a specific plan, laid out exactly how he believes we should pay for it to enhance our nation\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity, and Republicans in the House and Senate have indicated they don\xe2\x80\x99t even want to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s rather disappointing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, standing from here, I do not make a habit of discussing ongoing criminal or national security investigations.\xc2\xa0 So questions related to how or even whether the federal government is investigating this situation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was another horrific attack in France, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the White House has reached out to officials there and whether the President has been briefed on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is aware of reports that a French police officer and his partner were killed outside Paris.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a concerning situation.\xc2\xa0 It is only enhanced by the fact that there are indications that the killer may have had a terrorist affiliation.\xc2\xa0 So U.S. officials have been in touch with French authorities. \xc2\xa0As you know, the United States and France are allies, and our counterterrorism partnership is critical to the national security of both of our countries.\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate that the United States will do what we can to assist French authorities as they conduct this investigation and as they take the steps that they believe are necessary to continue to protect their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I first wanted to ask about the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today.\xc2\xa0 It seemed like they were matched nearly verbatim by Secretary Clinton, both on Twitter and in the speech that she gave right after the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can talk at all about if there\xe2\x80\x99s coordination on the messaging point today, kind of against Republicans, between the White House and Secretary Clinton about the discussion, who might have begun that conversation, and any kind of insight you could shed on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any advance coordination or notification that was provided by the White House to the Clinton campaign of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today.\xc2\xa0 That said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you should be particularly surprised that the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments and views on this topic are similar to the views and principles that are articulated by the woman who served as his Secretary of State during his first term in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou often hear me indicate that the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for his successor to build on the progress that our country has made and not scrap it.\xc2\xa0 I often make that argument in the context of our country\xe2\x80\x99s success in digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true in that context.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also happens to be true in the context of our homeland security and our national security.\xc2\xa0 The President does believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that his successor is somebody who recognizes that our country is safer than it was eight years ago; that we\xe2\x80\x99ve enhanced our standing around the world; that we\xe2\x80\x99ve strengthened our alliances; that we have refined and improved and strengthened our homeland security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we will -- the American people do face a question about whether or not they want to build on that progress because there surely is more that can be done to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President made the direct reference to making it harder for would-be homegrown extremists to get their hands on a gun.\xc2\xa0 So there certainly are steps that we can take.\xc2\xa0 But the question for the next President will be, do you want to build on the progress that we made over the last eight years or do you want to tear it down?\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just apply when it comes to the economy; it also applies when it comes to protecting the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Five straight public opinion polls in the UK have shown voters favor now leaving the European Union.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re set to head to the polls in about a week.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- obviously the President went there, spoke repeatedly about why he thought the UK should stay in the EU.\xc2\xa0 Now that the tide seems to have turned against that position, is there anything more that we can expect him to do in the coming days to sort of make a last-ditch effort to persuade voters?\xc2\xa0 And, secondly, is there anything the Treasury Department or the White House is doing to sort of prepare for what could happen to the financial markets if this sort of uncertainty is injected into them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Justin, as you often hear me say, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident there are well-compensated individuals in the United States that provide public analysis of polling data here in this country.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the same is true in the UK.\xc2\xa0 So, again, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s -- so I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that analysis to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will say is that the President did have an opportunity to travel to London six or eight weeks ago, and in the context of a conference with Prime Minister Cameron described how the United States benefits from having the UK as well-integrated with Europe.\xc2\xa0 We have a special relationship with the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 So the United States has an opinion, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an opinion that the President has shared publicly.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President also was quick to add, as I am, that this is a decision for the British people to make.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial one.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a consequential decision.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re confident that the British people will consider their options carefully.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly is important for them to weigh in on this decision.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a weighty one, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that they alone will make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Reuters yesterday reported that the administration had ruled out sort of additional executive actions to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are a wide array of things that the President has already been doing, and also that your preference is for Congress to come up with a solution here.\xc2\xa0 So kind of granting those, has the administration kind of ruled out kind of additional steps or an executive action that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet heard about to close the prison?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take any options that are available to the President off the table.\xc2\xa0 We do continue to believe that Congress should coordinate and cooperate with the administration in pursuit of a bipartisan national security goal, which is closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Even if there are some Republicans that don\'t support that bipartisan goal, they should at least be interested in trying to save taxpayers money.\xc2\xa0 And there are many indications that a substantial sum of money could be saved without enhancing or increasing the risk to the American people by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re going to continue to implement that strategy that we\'ve been focused on for quite some time, which is carefully reviewing the case files of the individuals that are currently housed there.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to work with our partners all around the world to find appropriate security circumstances in which those individuals can be safely transferred.\xc2\xa0 And that work continues.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any transfer announcements to make today, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you informed if there are any upcoming.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on this question of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comments and the President\xe2\x80\x99s, there was a phrase that the Secretary used, that somehow there are magic words once uttered will stop terrorism, she said about Trump.\xc2\xa0 And the President said, there\xe2\x80\x99s no magic in the words that radical -- magic words.\xc2\xa0 They were both used around the same time in Pittsburgh.\xc2\xa0 So there was no discussion at all between the campaign and the White House about this day?\xc2\xa0 It just seems such an unlikely coincidence that they would use phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cmagic words,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic terrorism\xe2\x80\x9d at the same time --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that anyone at the White House gave the Clinton campaign advance notice of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m also not sitting here telling you that it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence.\xc2\xa0 I think it should be apparent to all of you that President Obama and Secretary Clinton have similar approaches and consider the homeland security of the United States a top priority.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not making the case that it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m actually making a pretty bold case that they agree that these are principles that are worth fighting for and articulating, and that the use of the word "radical Islam" is a political talking point.\xc2\xa0 That is not a counterterrorism strategy.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, to use that political talking point only gives our enemies the legitimacy that they are desperately craving, and giving them that legitimacy only makes it easier for them to recruit.\xc2\xa0 And making it easier for them to recruit makes it harder for us to keep the country safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But clearly there is some discussion going on between the White House and the Clinton campaign about various things at some level?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are appropriate confines within the law where the Clinton campaign can be in communication with the White House.\xc2\xa0 I think that was evident when we released a video from the President last week through the campaign to announce his support for her in the general election.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anyone at the White House providing anybody at the Clinton campaign advance notice of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation about what Senator Sanders will do or say after the vote is completed tonight in the District and elsewhere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding -- and again, this is just based on published reports -- that Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton are planning to get together here in the not-too-distant future.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get ahead of what their meeting is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the discussions that Senator Sanders had with the President last week, what would you say was the understanding that the President had as to what the Senator would do after, given that he said that Secretary Clinton had already clinched the votes needed for the nomination?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President came away from the meeting with the impression that Senator Sanders understands exactly how important the general election is.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Sanders addressed all of you right outside that window and made clear how important it is that the Republican nominee for President not be elected next President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that was a view that he expressed.\xc2\xa0 So he clearly understands the stakes.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the President walked into his meeting with Senator Sanders well aware of the fact that Senator Sanders has more than earned the right to make his own decisions on his own timeframe about the future of his campaign.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly respectful of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has no -- the President has no expectation about when the campaign will end?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation is that that\'s a decision that will be made by Senator Sanders.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, often these post-NSC meeting briefings are very much just sort of battlefield assessments and a check-in.\xc2\xa0 This had a very different feel to it.\xc2\xa0 There was anger, there was frustration coming through from the President.\xc2\xa0 And part of it really did feel like a political speech.\xc2\xa0 Would you say that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair assessment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not my assessment.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what was different about this meeting is the fact that this meeting was convened 48 hours after the worst mass shooting in American history.\xc2\xa0 That is, as the President and the FBI Director have indicated, is likely the result of an individual who became radicalized.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yeah, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that this meeting took on a different flavor than it usually does.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team was able to report to him important and critical progress in implementing our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 In terms of reducing the flow of foreign fighters, reducing the ranks of ISIL fighters, reducing the amount of territory that they can control, reducing their ability to fund their operations -- ISIL is under increasing pressure because of the strategy that has been led by the United States and effectively implemented by our 65 coalition partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying that the American people are grieving after a terrible tragedy.\xc2\xa0 And there is intense focus on what steps we can take to prevent something like that from ever happening again.\xc2\xa0 And some of those steps include closing the loophole that allows individuals who are currently on the no-fly list from being able to walk into a gun store and buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 If it\'s too dangerous for you to board an airplane, it should be too dangerous for you to buy a firearm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that we should reinstitute the assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s too easy for a would-be homegrown extremist to get his or her hands on a weapon of war.\xc2\xa0 The President also believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to confuse political talking points for a counterterrorism strategy.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to protecting the American people, the President is quite passionate about that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that passion was on display over at the Treasury Department about an hour ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the things that the President got the most heated about in those remarks were not the sort of practical things in terms of confirming Adam Szubin or the gun control debate, or everything he had on that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good example of something I left out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on that long, long laundry list.\xc2\xa0 Things he was getting heated up about, at least as a viewer, were about the ban on Muslims.\xc2\xa0 He specifically mentioned a nominee tweeting, in particular.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned basically scapegoating of the Muslim community.\xc2\xa0 And it was couched as a defense of American values, which is something you have said would really be the message on the campaign trail, that this is, the President thinks, his role to defend American values, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing alongside Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I think what is clear is that there is a basic question about American values; that to discriminate against people because of their religious views undermines American values.\xc2\xa0 The President is quite passionate about defending American values.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President also is quite passionate about protecting the American people.\xc2\xa0 And there are consequences for using political rhetoric that alienates or marginalizes or targets Muslims.\xc2\xa0 It only serves to feed the narrative and confer legitimacy on ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s argument.\xc2\xa0 That is the thing that ISIL desperately craves.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know that ISIL leaders wake up every morning desperate to try to find ways to convey to the rest of the world that they are fighting the West in the name of Islam.\xc2\xa0 They call themselves religious leaders.\xc2\xa0 They label the individual who are in their ranks as holy warriors.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to perpetuate this notion that they represent the world\xe2\x80\x99s Muslims, more than a billion of them, in the fight against the West.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re wrong about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the political rhetoric that we too often hear on the campaign trail is so disconcerting.\xc2\xa0 It feeds the false narrative and the myth that our enemies depend on for their survival.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels strongly about that.\xc2\xa0 And the President is concerned that there are some who are willing to cynically overlook that fact just because it might be good politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to just step back here -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about a candidate, or several candidates, for President.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon to turn on cable television and see some Republican congressman I\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of talking about the President\xe2\x80\x99s non-use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islamic extremism\xe2\x80\x9d to define our enemy.\xc2\xa0 Those are facts.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to make clear why that matters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But aren\xe2\x80\x99t these the very same things we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear him say on the campaign trail?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this inherently a political speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, this is inherently a speech about what is necessary to protect our values and keep the country safe.\xc2\xa0 And that is the subject of intense political debate right now.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not denying that.\xc2\xa0 And it should be that way.\xc2\xa0 We should have a debate about what\xe2\x80\x99s important to keeping the country safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s why Ron and others are asking you -- parsing phrasing, because it feels like this is perhaps parts of this we would have heard tomorrow in Wisconsin, if the President had gone there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President feels quite strongly about making sure that his successor is someone who wants to build on the progress that we have made in strengthening our country and protecting our homeland.\xc2\xa0 And the rhetoric that we hear from a large number of Republicans undermines that.\xc2\xa0 And the President I think gave a pretty concise explanation for why exactly that is.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the great offense that I think many Americans take at undermining core American values.\xc2\xa0 Religious liberty is a founding principle of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t discriminate against people because of the way they worship God.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t treat them differently just because of where they attend religious services.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we do not do.\xc2\xa0 And the President is quite passionate about protecting that value.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop there.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion that was on display earlier this afternoon is not just a reflection of the way that our values have been undermined.\xc2\xa0 It is a reflection of the risk associated with pursuing that cynical strategy.\xc2\xa0 It is a strategy that undermines our ability to protect the American people in a very tangible way, particularly when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an attack that was carried out two days ago by an American citizen who had been radicalized by an enemy whose narrative is only advanced when we hear that kind of rhetoric from politicians.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick question.\xc2\xa0 Saudi Arabia, a very key ally in this fight against ISIS -- will the President be meeting with the Deputy Crown Prince, who is in town and met with the Secretary of State yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last couple of days some changes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule over the course of this week, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted as things get added to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And not coming to the White House at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule at this point.\xc2\xa0 We obviously had to change Wednesday -- we cancelled the trip.\xc2\xa0 The President added this trip to Orlando on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 So the next few days, in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, are in flux.\xc2\xa0 But if anything gets added, including the meeting that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tLesley.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I was hoping you could flesh out a little bit more about what the President might do on Thursday in Orlando.\xc2\xa0 And Governor Scott mentioned -- you were asked -- that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t called Governor Scott.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason he has not called him?\xc2\xa0 He has called the governors of other states before or after a similar event.\xc2\xa0 And the Governor has been pretty critical of the President.\xc2\xa0 He said he wants a federal plan for a Zika response by Wednesday and he has not heard anything.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s also not been a response to a federal emergency declaration after the Orlando shooting.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Lesley, is the fact that -- Lesley, I do anticipate that the President will have an opportunity to see Governor Scott when he travels to Florida on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Governor Scott will certainly be invited, and hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll be there.\xc2\xa0 But obviously I\xe2\x80\x99d make clear that senior officials at the White House have been in touch not just with Governor Scott\xe2\x80\x99s office but with Governor Scott directly.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has been in touch with Mayor Dyer directly, obviously, and a range of federal officials have been in touch with their state and local counterparts to ensure a seamless, coordinated response to this terrible situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about an emergency declaration?\xc2\xa0 Is that being considered?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s going through the regular process.\xc2\xa0 It is rather extraordinary to make a specific request like this for an event that is not ongoing.\xc2\xa0 But that will be considered through the regular channels, and once a determination has been made about that request we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously let you all know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would your response to this at all be anything to do with Governor Scott, who has endorsed the President?\xc2\xa0 Or is that a conflict between the President and the Governor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to the Governor to describe how he may or may not be influenced by politics.\xc2\xa0 But President Obama certainly believes that in terms of mobilizing federal resources to respond to a grieving community, politics needs to be set aside.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly has been President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Zika?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 On Zika, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made quite clear that this is a serious situation and our public health professionals almost four months ago put together a package that was submitted by the White House to Congress of the resources that they believe are necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 And Democrats have strongly supported the request that was made by our public health professionals, but for reasons that are difficult to explain, Republicans in Congress have resisted offering up the support that our public health professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we would certainly welcome Governor Scott\'s advocacy with his fellow Republicans to get Congress to provide the resources that public health professionals and states, particularly a big state like Florida, need to fight the Zika virus and to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s the war against ISIS and then there\'s this political war of words that seems to have reached strange proportions.\xc2\xa0 In the President\'s address today, he seemed to be acknowledging that, that this is -- at times, he seemed to be ridiculing his critics for focusing on this.\xc2\xa0 But then again, the President devoted a big chunk of this address to those words.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, this has been said for a long time, ever since the war against ISIS started.\xc2\xa0 Why is he so angry about the rhetoric now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you yourself said you\'ll turn on cable television and see some congressman that you\'ve never heard of before.\xc2\xa0 So why does this matter so much?\xc2\xa0 Why is he so furious about this today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think, Michelle, what I would describe is a President who is passionate about doing everything that\'s necessary to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And too often we heard Republicans -- some we\'ve heard of, some we\'ve never heard of -- making an argument that what\'s necessary to protect the country is for the President to describe the threat as the threat of radical Islamist extremism.\xc2\xa0 And here\'s why that\'s important:\xc2\xa0 That is used as a substitute for actions that Congress can and should take that would enhance our national security -- because again, maybe there is a Republican argument to be made about how using the magic words will somehow prompt ISIL to melt away.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\'s true, but they\'re welcome to make that argument.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President actually thinks is that Congress should act to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from being able to buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 That would make us safer.\xc2\xa0 That would certainly make it harder for somebody who is suspected of being involved in terrorism from being able to get a gun, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans, but it would make us safer.\xc2\xa0 We certainly could see Congress say, well, you know, we\'re scared of the NRA so we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that.\xc2\xa0 But you know what, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we confirm Adam Szubin?\xc2\xa0 This is the financial expert who served in Democratic and Republican administrations who\'s responsible for a critical element of our counter-ISIL strategy, which is shutting off their funding.\xc2\xa0 But for more than a year, this financial expert, who served in Democratic and Republican administrations, has been blocked by Republican members of the United States Senate for reasons that they admit are only related to politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President, or you, as well, not see a distinction, though, between calling what happens "Islam" and calling certain acts "radical Islamic terror"?\xc2\xa0 I mean, some people would say, really, what\'s the difference?\xc2\xa0 And if you\'re getting specific enough to call something "radical Islamic terror" when it clearly is, why is that such a big deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, to the extent that it would be helpful, we could provide you the numerous instances in which the President has acknowledged that what ISIL and other extremist organizations represent is a perversion of Islam.\xc2\xa0 The President, on a number of occasions, has made clear that part of their strategy is to recruit potentially vulnerable members of the Muslim community in the United States and around the world.\xc2\xa0 The President, on a number of occasions, has talked about the responsibility that leaders in the Muslim community -- both here in the United States and around the world -- have to speak out against those radical elements that are seeking to recruit people in their communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand that.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s the problem, Michelle:\xc2\xa0 The counterterrorism strategy articulated by Republicans is that the President should utter the magic words to defeat ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That\'s their strategy.\xc2\xa0 And the President says, let\'s define our enemy and let\'s make sure we define our enemy precisely.\xc2\xa0 Our enemy is not the religion of Islam.\xc2\xa0 Our enemy are radical, violent extremists that seek to pervert Islam and seek to advance a narrative that they are representing Islam in a war against the West.\xc2\xa0 That\'s false.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a myth.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the question really is, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t those Republicans in Congress actually focused on things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t just magic words but are a tangible contribution to our homeland security?\xc2\xa0 Let\'s close the no-buy, no-fly loophole.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s confirm Adam Szubin.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s hire 200 additional ATF officers.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s pass an AUMF that has actually authorized the Commander-in-Chief and our men and women in uniform to win this war against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 There are tangible things that Congress could do, but yet, time and time and time again, they refuse because they think that somehow the magic words are somehow more important.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you sure that anyone sees those magic words as a strategy, though, and they\'re not just pointing out the fact that the President hasn\'t wanted to say them for a very long time, even though others have, and now including Hillary Clinton?\xc2\xa0 Is just seems like, when he talks about people painting this with a very broad brush, it seems maybe as if you\'re painting this with a broader brush than some of those critics mean from the beginning.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What other critiques have those critics offered in terms of fighting ISIL?\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 This is the thing that they constantly come back to.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not the one who constantly brings up "radical Islamic extremism."\xc2\xa0 That\'s not me.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the guy who usually stands here.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the Republicans, many of whom I\'ve never heard of, who book themselves on cable television so they can make this argument.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\'s cynical.\xc2\xa0 They know it\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 They know that -- well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they know this, but the President knows that it undermines our ability to defeat ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It undermines our ability to prevent ISIL from recruiting in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande says the words "radical Islamic terror" very specifically, and Hillary Clinton says it, and she says she\'s happy to say it, are they then undermining values and strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard them criticize the President for not using the magic words.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s the point.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very specific and precise about how to define our enemy.\xc2\xa0 And for people who say that the only reason we haven\xe2\x80\x99t defeated ISIL is the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t used the magic words that they have chosen, that\'s cynical politics there, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to protect the country.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, as was on display tragically on Saturday night, it potentially makes the nation more vulnerable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that really necessary, though, to make this speech political?\xc2\xa0 What did the President think it was adding to make something that is about fighting the kind of act that we just saw about fighting Republican rhetoric?\xc2\xa0 What did he think that was going to add?\xc2\xa0 Or does he feel like that Republican rhetoric is so strong and so powerful out there that he needs to counter it when he\'s talking about countering terrorism?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President believes that it is worth having a debate about the most effective way to protect our country.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s worth having a debate about who\'s the person that will sit in the Oval Office, charged with making the most important decisions about how to protect the country, and there will be ample opportunity for the President to engage in that debate through the fall.\xc2\xa0 And I think the American people are going to care what he has to say about it, because he\'s been the person in charge of making those decisions over the last seven and a half years.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what the President was talking about today is making sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat mistakes that we\'ve made in our history when we acted out of fear.\xc2\xa0 And a willingness to compromise our values, even in the face of fear, is something that our nation and our leaders have previously regretted.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to prevent that mistake from happening again.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To continue along the lines just a little bit -- whether it was a political speech or not, it was directed to a domestic audience, to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And perhaps more than ever, leaders of terrorist groups such as ISIL and al Qaeda, and their emissaries across the world, are really now focusing on what the President has to say.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they\'re also focusing on what you have to say in your briefings.\xc2\xa0 As the President\'s spokesperson, what continued message does President Obama want to deliver on behalf of the American people directly to these individuals who would like to see Americans harmed and their allies as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think some of what the President had to say today is a message that was focused on the U.S. audience, but it\'s hopefully a message that the world will see.\xc2\xa0 The world should understand that the United States is committed to the founding principles that make our country great -- a protection of free press, protecting freedom of speech, protecting the ability to worship God in the way that we choose.\xc2\xa0 Those are central to the founding of our country.\xc2\xa0 And to compromise them because we\xe2\x80\x99re scared or fearful is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to regret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, are these individuals that are terrorists that are doing such harm, are they the same kind of people who understand Jeffersonian democracy and would understand what freedom of the press and freedom of religion mean in their world, in their environment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about ISIL leaders, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to them is quite direct -- is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to succeed in mobilizing the international community to degrade and ultimately destroy your organization.\xc2\xa0 And if you threaten or harm Americans, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find you and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold you accountable for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I made reference yesterday to the President\xe2\x80\x99s record speaking for itself, and part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s record is a long list of dead terrorists.\xc2\xa0 So the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shied away from using force to protect the American people, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to shy away from using force to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are also complicated questions about what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do here in the United States to protect the homeland and to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that does have a direct impact on our commitment to core American values and a commitment to a society that reflects the diversity of our country, and that prizes things like dignity and inclusiveness and tolerance.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd these are the profound concepts that in some ways we take for granted in our day-to-day life that are what make America the greatest country in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKenneth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you said the administration and President Obama won\xe2\x80\x99t be distracted by what you called \xe2\x80\x9csmall remarks" by Donald Trump and Republicans when it comes to saying \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islam\xe2\x80\x9d or refusing to say it, and the President should resign if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 So what happened in the past 24 hours?\xc2\xa0 What changed?\xc2\xa0 And is it safe to say the President is annoyed by those criticisms?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kenneth, I know that we all have to endure the challenge of differentiating the variety of charges that are lobbed on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 And there was a suggestion -- I think this was what I was asked about yesterday -- that somehow the President may have been complicit or not concerned about the terrorist attack that occurred in Orlando on Saturday night, early Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was responding to when I made those comments yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today speak for themselves when it comes to making sure we don\xe2\x80\x99t confuse a political talking point for a counterterrorism strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the White House reaction to what happened on the House floor yesterday after the moment of silence -- there was protest, House Democrats wanted to find out the status of some legislation on gun control after the Charleston church massacre, the legislation that was drafted.\xc2\xa0 In the next -- probably right now, Democrats are trying to force a vote on no-fly, no-buy.\xc2\xa0 The White House response on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President and the administration strongly support common-sense, meaningful gun safety legislation.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Homeland Security said it today.\xc2\xa0 Meaningful gun control, gun safety legislation is critical to our homeland security.\xc2\xa0 This is a homeland security issue now.\xc2\xa0 It is a source of concern by our homeland security professionals that it is too easy for would-be terrorists to get their hands on weapons of war and use them against innocent Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a homeland security issue, every bit as much as it is a question about protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is simply this:\xc2\xa0 We can take common-sense steps that will do more to protect the American people and protect our communities without undermining or gutting the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the question really for Republicans in Congress is, given this moment, given what we have endured, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they act on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, finally on Orlando, on the trip on Thursday, do we know exactly where the President -- will he meet with the doctors who were heroes and saved those lives?\xc2\xa0 We heard from a few of them today, and the victims as well -- the victims\' families.\xc2\xa0 Do we know if he actually is going to meet with those impacted and, obviously, the first responders and the doctors as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is certainly interested in spending time with people in the Orlando community that were touched by this terrorist attack and by people who were -- acted quickly to save lives.\xc2\xa0 The plans for the President to travel to Orlando were initiated at the end of the day yesterday, so our advance team has only arrived in Orlando this morning.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re still in the early stages of planning this trip.\xc2\xa0 But as more details come together, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you posted on what the President plans to do when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Orlando.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, yesterday you said seeing after the Orlando shooting individuals lining up to donate blood was powerful and represented what this country is all about.\xc2\xa0 But under the Obama administration policy, gay and bisexual men are prohibited from donating blood unless they\xe2\x80\x99ve been celibate for a year.\xc2\xa0 That means a gay person who wanted to donate blood to a wounded friend or a partner or spouse in Orlando was probably unable to.\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans to revisit that policy in the aftermath of the shooting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, as you know, this is a decision that was made by the FDA, and it was made consistent with the advice that our scientists have offered about the best way to ensure the safety of the blood supply.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you do know, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered this, that there was a policy decision that was made to change what had been a lifetime ban on gay men donating blood to a one-year deferral that you described.\xc2\xa0 So there has been a policy change.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is a policy change that was made consistent with the advice of our best scientists and public health professionals.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that when it comes to these kinds of questions, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to rely on scientific advice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on what your knowledge is, is there an opportunity for a further change on this policy?\xc2\xa0 Or would that have to happen during another administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if there are any additional changes that are made, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be rooted in the advice that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting from the scientists at the FDA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRich.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when did the President decide to expand his remarks from what are often the statistics of war following these types of briefings -- 13,000 airstrikes, troop movements in Iraq and Syria?\xc2\xa0 It appeared to be two separate speeches in a way.\xc2\xa0 And when did he decide to do that?\xc2\xa0 Did he go to the Treasury Department -- did the White House arrange that on-camera availability with that in mind -- with that message, the one about American values, in mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Rich, no.\xc2\xa0 This meeting the President convened with his national security team to get an update on our progress against ISIL is one that has been on the books for a couple of weeks now.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President every two or three weeks sits down with his national security team to review our strategy, to review our progress, and look for ways to intensify those elements of our strategy that are showing promise against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So this is a previously scheduled meeting, but obviously it occurred at a rather poignant moment -- just about 48 hours after the worst incident of -- the worst mass shooting incident on American soil in our history.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are indications that the individual who perpetrated that shooting was radicalized.\xc2\xa0 So it is not uncommon for the President to speak to all of you on-camera after that meeting occurs.\xc2\xa0 But yes, those comments were necessarily different, given the context in which he was delivering them.\xc2\xa0 I know the President spent some time working on his remarks both last night and again this morning, so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something the President has been thinking about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Speaker Paul Ryan earlier today said, I do not think a Muslim ban is in the country\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.\xc2\xa0 There are other Republicans who have said the same.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see a difference between a Republican who says they will vote for Donald Trump but opposes this type of -- or these types of proposals that have come out of this campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Rich, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a much more interesting question for the individuals who do have concerns about imposing a religious test on people entering the United States but yet insist that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to advocate for the election of a candidate that supports that ban.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very difficult pair of positions that they\xe2\x80\x99ll need to figure out how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to reconcile.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President bring this up when he speaks with -- when he has his regular conversations with House and Senate Leadership on the Republican side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which this particular issue or the challenge of reconciling these two positions have come up in his private conversations with individual congressional leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned earlier that you want Congress -- the administration has asked for Congress to pass an AUMF to confirm Adam Szubin so we can win this war.\xc2\xa0 The administration is operating, still under a very old AUMF, designed for a different fight in a way.\xc2\xa0 Adam Szubin is working under an acting capacity.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a bit misleading to say that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it going to change things tomorrow drastically?\xc2\xa0 The responsibility lies with the White House, no?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that despite the fact that Congress has been AWOL when it comes to these critically important issues related to our war against ISIL, our men and women in uniform continue to perform their duties and do their job against ISIL, even when Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Szubin and the individuals in his office continue to do their job to figure out how to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing even though Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t do their job and actually confirm him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it make it dramatically easier for any of those parties to do their job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think our men and women in uniform would certainly appreciate knowing that the United States Congress supports their efforts on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 I know that our allies would certainly appreciate seeing Congress weigh in with their support of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I know that when Adam Szubin is doing meetings with his counterparts all around the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to only enhance his negotiating position and only enhance his leverage in conversations if the individuals that are sitting across the table know that Adam has the strong bipartisan support of the Congress.\xc2\xa0 The only reason he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that now, the only reason he can\xe2\x80\x99t take the strongest possible negotiating position into those conversations that are critical to our efforts to defeat ISIL is because a bunch of Republicans in the Senate are playing politics.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s shameful.\xc2\xa0 It intensely disrespects the government service of a financial expert who served this country in the Bush administration and continues to serve the country in the Obama administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s rather unfortunate the way that he\xe2\x80\x99s been treated.\xc2\xa0 And I hope that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dissuade other dedicated, talented, qualified individuals like him from serving the American people in our government.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully it won\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tFred.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, actually.\xc2\xa0 California lawmakers have decided to extend the health care exchanges there to illegal immigrants.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President said throughout 2009, 2010 would not happen under the ACA.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the White House actually would oppose?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the President or someone with the White House might talk to Governor Brown about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a state policy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the policy decision that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my counterpart in Governor Brown\xe2\x80\x99s office for an answer about why they\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to pursue it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be counter to what the administration policy was pushing when they were arguing in favor of the health care law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is correct that it is different than the policy that the federal government has pursued.\xc2\xa0 So that fact is true.\xc2\xa0 But again, as a variety of Republican governors have not hesitated to demonstrate, they are, in many cases, willing to use their own authority as they choose.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other topic -- beyond being a policy priority as far as gun control goes, have there been any national security studies, reports that have said that gun control would be a counterterrorism measure, an effective counterterrorism measure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Director of Homeland Security said it today, so I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good endorsement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also ironic that you ask this question, Fred, because, as you know, Republicans have routinely prevented the CDC from actually even conducting any studies about the impact of gun violence.\xc2\xa0 So the answer to your question is something that Republicans I think are scared to learn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But beyond the possible ban on semi-automatic rifles, would any of these measures have prevented what happened in Orlando?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Fred, the investigation into what happened in Orlando is barely 48 hours old.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to assess at this point exactly what could have been done differently or what different laws or regulations would have prevented this terrible, tragic terrorist incident from occurring.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, the truth is the Secretary of Homeland Security I think made a pretty intuitive argument.\xc2\xa0 He certainly has a lot of expertise in this area, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot of common sense that informs his position.\xc2\xa0 If any individual -- just about any individual can walk into a gun store, buy a weapon of war and walk out that same day, that certainly enhances the ability of a would-be terrorist to kill even more innocent Americans.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we prevent that from happening?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why Republicans *[don\xe2\x80\x99t] want to prevent that from happening.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLauren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You and the President have been talking a lot about religious liberty, the importance of not having a litmus test.\xc2\xa0 And yet, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a great debate in the Supreme Court about the HHS mandate controversy and religious liberty.\xc2\xa0 No timetable has been set to end that.\xc2\xa0 And given that both sides have indicated to the Supreme Court that there is a way to satisfy all parties, what\xe2\x80\x99s the holdup?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of -- as you know, the Supreme Court remanded this back down to a lower court to try to arrive at this compromise that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeking for a number of years now.\xc2\xa0 And I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on that process.\xc2\xa0 You might check with either DOJ or HHS and they can give you some more insight into where that currently stands.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question.\xc2\xa0 An indictment was dismissed against David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress today for taking videos of a Planned Parenthood employee talking about selling fetal parts.\xc2\xa0 Is this a good time to look at what Planned Parenthood does and says in selling fetal baby parts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is obviously something that has cropped up a fair amount over the last year or so.\xc2\xa0 What the Obama administration has made clear are a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that Planned Parenthood is an organization that provides needed health care services to millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 This is a valuable service that many Americans rely on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration has also made clear that there are important rules and laws, consistent with our moral obligations, that are on the books.\xc2\xa0 And we expect everybody to follow them.\xc2\xa0 I know that Planned Parenthood has indicated that they do follow them, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for a more specific statement about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Josh, was there a point in recent hours or days where the President just slammed his fist down on the Resolute Desk and said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s criticism and he said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to answer back?\xc2\xa0 Was there a straw that broke the camel\xe2\x80\x99s back, leading to today\xe2\x80\x99s remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think the President does continue to be concerned by the rhetoric that we hear from a variety of Republicans, including the presumptive Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0 This is rhetoric that isn\xe2\x80\x99t just contrary to our values; it actually undermines our homeland security.\xc2\xa0 And as somebody who swore an oath to protect our homeland security and to protect our values, the President has quite strong feelings about it.\xc2\xa0 And after convening a meeting with his national security team to discuss what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to protect the country from ISIL, after spending the last 48 hours being briefed on the worst mass shooting in American history, I think the conditions came together for the President to deliver a forceful and passionate message about what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd political rhetoric, magic words aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to address the threat that is posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 If anything, ironically it could make that threat even more dangerous because it only serves to advance the narrative that our enemy is seeking to perpetuate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Considering the mood that the President reflected earlier today, is he in any mood for a picnic tonight -- (laughter) -- that includes Republican members of Congress coming by to chow down?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s National Bourbon Day.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was just going to say, is there ever a bad night for barbecue?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you guys have a picnic last night for staff?\xc2\xa0 The Vice President mentioned that in his speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, what typically happens when the South Lawn is set up to host members of Congress, I think either the day before or the day after administration officials will also enjoy a picnic to thank them for their service to the country and the government in the same way that we\xe2\x80\x99re thanking members of Congress and their staff and their families for their commitment to serving the government.\xc2\xa0 So there was an event last night, much like the one that all of you will see the President speak to tonight.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you get RSVPs from members of Congress who will or will not come tonight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there are RSVPs that are collected everywhere.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for all of them, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to individual offices about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to attend.\xc2\xa0 But yeah, I would not be disappointed if I, for instance, ran into Senator Perdue in the hallway, for example.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s likely?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Probably not.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You got any Bible verses for him?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I should prepare just in case I happen to.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99s been studying up himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M.
