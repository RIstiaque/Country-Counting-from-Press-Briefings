SAST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us as we make our way to Cape Town.\xc2\xa0 Here to deliver the world\xe2\x80\x99s fastest gaggle is Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll begin by going to Robben Island.\xc2\xa0 This is the President\xe2\x80\x99s second trip to Robben Island but it\xe2\x80\x99s his family\xe2\x80\x99s first, and it was very important for the President to have the opportunity to bring his family to Robben Island and to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela and all the people who sacrificed by being imprisoned there on behalf of their ideals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHis tour will include the \xe2\x80\x9cB Section\xe2\x80\x9d courtyard, the recreation room, as well as Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s cell, the Robert Sobukwe House, and the Lime Quarry.\xc2\xa0 The tour guide will be Ahmed Kathrada, who is 83 years old, a former inmate of Robben Island, a notable anti-Apartheid activist.\xc2\xa0 He also led the President\xe2\x80\x99s tour in 2006 when he visited Robben Island.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you spell that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Ahmed -- A-h-m-e-d and then K-a-t-h-r-a-d-a.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition on Robben Island of former inmates giving these tours, which adds even more meaning to the opportunity to be shown where people were imprisoned by those who shared in the sacrifice with Nelson Mandela and so many others.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfter that, as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to visit a community health center run by Desmond Tutu.\xc2\xa0 And of course, Archbishop Tutu was also a very important voice for social justice and in opposition to the Apartheid movement -- before giving the speech in Cape Town.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anything else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the first time for Mrs. Obama and the girls?\xc2\xa0 They were never at Robben Island before?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so last time they visited, they were able to visit with Nelson Mandela but they were not able to make it to Robben Island, so this is the first time for them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be joined by any members of the Mandela family as well on this tour?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just Mr. Kathrada.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments on Egypt yesterday -- can you say what kind of contacts you\xe2\x80\x99ve been having with the Egyptian government regarding safeguarding the embassy and consulates?\xc2\xa0 Are there sort of any military contingencies in place?\xc2\xa0 That kind of stuff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with all of our contacts in the government -- the political leadership, the military.\xc2\xa0 Those conversations haven\xe2\x80\x99t just focused on the security of our facilities -- that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly been a top priority for us -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve also focused on our desire for there to be a peaceful resolution of differences in Egypt, respect for both peaceful protests, also the obligation of the opposition to protest peacefully.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been in touch with the opposition as well through our contacts.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of contingencies, we\xe2\x80\x99ve basically taken the appropriate action to ensure that our embassies and consulates have additional security measures and that our personnel are taking additional security precautions.\xc2\xa0 I do want to just note there was an inaccurate report yesterday that I saw about a military deployment of some kind to Egypt -- that is not the case.\xc2\xa0 We believe we have significant security measures in place and that our civilians who are serving in Egypt can take additional precautions.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re watching the situation very carefully.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any of this informed by the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s report on Benghazi?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything done differently because of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I would have to defer that question to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had significant experience in Egypt with trying to assure security -- for instance, around the protests, some of which turned violent last September in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with a very volatile security situation for some time now, and we very regularly review the security posture and the diplomatic posture of our people in Egypt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know one American was killed -- reported killed in what happened.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House had any kind of contact with the family by any chance? He was a D.C.-area resident.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I know that the State Department has been in touch with the family and we\xe2\x80\x99re providing all the services that we do in these instances.\xc2\xa0 It was clearly a tragic case, particularly painful to lose a young person.\xc2\xa0 It speaks to how volatile the security situation is there.\xc2\xa0 The President is certainly aware of the loss of that American and shares in the grief that the family has, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if there are any additional contacts to report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in touch with Secretary Kerry at all about the Middle East peace process?\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s extended his stay to talk about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President spoke at length with Secretary Kerry before he left for this latest trip to the region.\xc2\xa0 So he fully supports what Secretary Kerry is of course trying to move forward there.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been kept regularly updated by Secretary Kerry and his team from the road, and I think it speaks to what high a priority we place on trying to move forward with a peace process that the Secretary of State has invested so much time and energy in this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President and Secretary Kerry haven\xe2\x80\x99t chatted recently about it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of them having spoken since -- in the last couple days while he\xe2\x80\x99s been there.\xc2\xa0 They did speak again before he left and Secretary Kerry briefed the President on his plans.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if we have any updates on additional conversations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one thing about tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I think President Bush and, of course, the First Lady -- former First Lady will be in Tanzania.\xc2\xa0 Is there any talk -- have there been any -- well, first of all, would the current President be talking or meeting in any way with President Bush?\xc2\xa0 And/or have there been any discussions about them doing any kind of joint event?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- well, first of all, the First Lady, Michelle Obama, will be participating in the forum that Laura Bush is hosting.\xc2\xa0 So they will appear together.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important forum that lifts up the role of women in Africa.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the presence of the Bushes is something that marks I think the bipartisan support for Africa that exists in the United States, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very welcome symbol that they can be there at the same time.\xc2\xa0 We think it sends a very positive message that both political parties in the United States share a commitment to this continent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the two Presidents, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated if there are any scheduling updates as to whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll be at the same place at the same time.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s still being worked through.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But right now, where does it stand?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not aware that we have anything scheduled at this time.\xc2\xa0 But it may -- there may be something.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has President Obama spoken with Morsi directly?\xc2\xa0 Or is there any high-level -- like Biden, anyone like that -- contact with the Egyptian government that you can read out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 There have been a range of high-level contacts.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the fullest to read out to you, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if there\xe2\x80\x99s any additional information there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:58 A.M.
