EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I\'d just like to say to you that the President has made the decision not to release any of the photographs of the deceased Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 And rather than -- or rather, first I will give you the language the President used when he was recently interviewed about an hour ago to explain his decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis is in an interview with CBS 60 Minutes, Steve Kroft.\xc2\xa0 The President was asked -- he said that they were discussing -- when bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s body was taken out of the compound, the President was asked about how they knew it was him.\xc2\xa0 And he said:<br/>\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they landed, we had very strong confirmation at that point that it was him.\xc2\xa0 Photographs had been taken.\xc2\xa0 Facial analysis indicated that, in fact, it was him.\xc2\xa0 We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet done DNA testing, but at that point we were 95 percent sure.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQuestion:\xc2\xa0 Did you see the pictures?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQuestion:\xc2\xa0 What was your reaction when you saw them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President:\xc2\xa0 It was him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQuestion:\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you release them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President:\xc2\xa0 We discussed this internally.\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind that we are absolutely certain that this was him.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve done DNA sampling and testing and so there is no doubt that we killed Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not who we are.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t trot out this stuff as trophies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe fact of the matter is this was somebody who was deserving of the justice that he received, and I think Americans and people around the world are glad that he is gone.\xc2\xa0 But we don\'t need to spike the football.\xc2\xa0 And I think that given the graphic nature of these photos, it would create some national security risk -- and I\'ve discussed this with Bob Gates and Hillary Clinton and my intelligence teams, and they all agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQuestion:\xc2\xa0 There are people in Pakistan, for example, who say, look, this is all a lie.\xc2\xa0 Obama -- this is another American trick.\xc2\xa0 Osama is not dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President:\xc2\xa0 The truth is that we were monitoring worldwide reaction.\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt that bin Laden is dead.\xc2\xa0 Certainly there is no doubt among al Qaeda members that he is dead.\xc2\xa0 And so we don\'t think that a photograph in and of itself is going to make any difference.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be some folks who deny it.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is you will not see bin Laden walking on this Earth again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat\'s the conclusion of the excerpt.\xc2\xa0 I think it states rather thoroughly why the President made the decision that he did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith that, I\'ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Based on those comments, the President made a very compelling case why not to release the photos.\xc2\xa0 So what was the internal debate, and was he ever seriously considering releasing photos?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the photos didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist until bin Laden was killed, so there\xe2\x80\x99s not a great deal of time between then and the decision.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously arguments to be made on either side.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, as the President described, these are graphic photographs of someone who was shot in the face -- or the head, rather -- and it is not in our national security interests to allow those images, as has been in the past been the case, to become icons for -- to rally opinion against the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s number one priority is the safety and security of American citizens at home and Americans abroad.\xc2\xa0 There is no need to release these photographs to establish Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\xc2\xa0 And he saw no other compelling reason to release them, given the potential for national security risk, and further, because he believes, as he said so clearly, this is not who we are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was he, in the time period you\'re discussing, the moment he had the photos until now that we know the answer, was he grappling with this at all?\xc2\xa0 Or was his stance clear and he was just gathering other opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the evolution of his decision-making process.\xc2\xa0 When I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him discuss it, he held this opinion very firmly.\xc2\xa0 And he has held that opinion very firmly.\xc2\xa0 But this is a very short period of time.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he wanted to hear the opinions of others, but he was very clear about his view on this.\xc2\xa0 And obviously his decision is categorical.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 Director Panetta, in one of the interviews he did yesterday, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe government obviously has been talking about how best to do this, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- there was any question that ultimately a photograph would be presented to the public.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How do you explain that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that there are compelling arguments for, in general, the release of information and there\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion to be had about the pros and cons.\xc2\xa0 And the President engaged in that discussion and made a decision.\xc2\xa0 Every member of the national security team is aware of and expressed the downside of releasing, which has I think weighed heavily on the President in terms of the potential risks it would pose to Americans serving abroad and Americans traveling abroad.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the idea that this is 100 percent obvious -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the fact of the matter is, the President never gets to make a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s 100 percent obvious because those kind of decisions never get to his desk.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that I understand, but I\xe2\x80\x99m saying his comment was there was no question that a photograph would be released -- obviously that was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the thing is the President made this decision.\xc2\xa0 He consulted members of his national security team.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable arguments to be made.\xc2\xa0 The President felt very strongly and made the decision he made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you talked yesterday a lot about firefight.\xc2\xa0 Who was it that was shooting back at the U.S. commandos?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have, as you know, since the moment this operation became public been as helpful as we can be to provide as much information as we can.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the operational details, we have gotten to the point where we cannot cross lines because of the necessity for preserving the methods and operational techniques and capabilities of the kinds of forces that were used in this case.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to the limit of our ability to do that and still maintain some of the things we need to maintain and be kept secret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo that\'s a long way of beginning my answer to say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve revealed a lot of information.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been as forthcoming with facts as we can be.\xc2\xa0 A lot of information came out quickly. When we needed to clarify some of the information that we had as more information came in, we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided that.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of further details of the operation, I don\'t have any for you.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to obviously consult with the Defense Department about them, but I don\'t have any more information.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said already the operational details.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But some things, as you acknowledged yesterday, have changed as the information came in.\xc2\xa0 Is the fact of a firefight solid?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You heard the account that I read yesterday, and that is information that I provided.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just simply saying I\xe2\x80\x99m not going further than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious about you mentioned --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go further than what I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So we can talk about -- we can ask a lot about operational details.\xc2\xa0 The answer to your question is certainly contained within the account I read yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point where we need to be mindful of the necessity to protect our ability in the future to go after other bad guys, perhaps in the same way we went after this one.\xc2\xa0 And some of the capacities that we have, the methods that we use need to be protected and not compromised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask one follow-up question.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that the way in which bin Laden was killed and buried at sea might hurt the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to reach out to the Muslim world as he has tried to over the last two years?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The efforts that were made to give Osama bin Laden an appropriate burial, following Islamic precepts and traditions, were considerable.\xc2\xa0 However, I would also say that there is nothing -- the respect that was shown to him and his body was far greater than the respect that Osama bin Laden showed to the victims on 9/11 or any of his other victims, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because that\xe2\x80\x99s who we are.\xc2\xa0 So we feel very comfortable with the fact that we took extraordinary measures to show that respect to the traditions of the Islamic faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question is about the President\xe2\x80\x99s specific outreach to the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 How does this affect that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President speak on Sunday evening about the unbelievably important fact to make clear, that President Bush made clear before President Obama, that our efforts in the fight against terrorists, against al Qaeda, are not aimed at Islam, are not aimed at Muslims.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, that the cooperation and assistance provided by Muslims around the world is essential to our fight and it\xe2\x80\x99s not about them, because Osama bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer -- a mass murderer of people around the world, including Muslims.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we obviously believe that we were absolutely within our rights to go after the most wanted man in the world, the most wanted terrorist in the world -- the man who ordered the attacks on so many Americans and killed so many Americans.\xc2\xa0 And we -- it needs to be recognized that this is seen as a good thing throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 And yet, because of who we are, we took extraordinary measures to show the kind of respect that was shown in his burial.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to the families of the victims of 9/11 and the USS Cole and other terrorist acts by al Qaeda if these family members say they want the photo released so they can have some closure?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s response to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go beyond the words of the President, and I will rephrase them to say that there is no question at all that Osama bin Laden is dead.\xc2\xa0 He will not walk this Earth again.\xc2\xa0 We have established beyond any doubt, through DNA evidence, facial recognition, visual recognition, the naming of him by individuals on that compound, that Osama bin Laden was shot and killed on Sunday night.\xc2\xa0 He is dead.\xc2\xa0 And that -- I think Americans feel a great sense of closure because of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any other -- I understand the photographs are off the table.\xc2\xa0 Is there any other evidence of his death that might -- that you\xe2\x80\x99re still considering releasing, the President is still considering releasing?\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s video of his burial at sea, whether the DNA evidence -- is there anything else that could be released?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will simply say that we are -- that this decision applies to all visual evidence.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of discussions that might be had to go into more detail about how the DNA evidence was analyzed and collected, how the facial recognition evidence was analyzed and collected, and how the experts reached their conclusion that this was without any shred of doubt Osama bin Laden, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that information might be made available or will be made available in the future.\xc2\xa0 But this decision that I cited that the President made has to do with the visual evidence, the photographic evidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, the CIA Director, Leon Panetta, said in a closed-door briefing on Capitol Hill about the Pakistani government, that they either were involved or are incompetent.\xc2\xa0 Is that the position of the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I assume you mean by a closed-door briefing a classified briefing?\xc2\xa0 I have no comment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip.\xc2\xa0 Oh, sorry, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify, you said that the President, based on your observations, had always held the position that these photos should not be released?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I just meant that we\xe2\x80\x99re now two and a half days since this took place, that I know he had this -- I heard him express this view yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But there was still -- he was gathering the thoughts and views of others on his team.\xc2\xa0 So \xe2\x80\x9clong held\xe2\x80\x9d is an impossible statement to make since we\xe2\x80\x99re only talking about a couple of days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this a sense that he had made up his mind and wanted just to open it up for opinions to sway him as to whether or not they should be released?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has a national security team, and he wanted to hear the opinions of others, obviously.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how he makes decisions in this White House, and he wants to hear, as he did with the decision to authorize this mission, which I think has been reported was not a decision that every member of his team supported or thought was -- people had reservations, obviously, because it was a very risky mission.\xc2\xa0 But this is the process that he undertakes because he believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s the way he wants his presidency to function.\xc2\xa0 He wants the unvarnished opinions and advice and assessments of his top advisors.\xc2\xa0 And in a situation like this, the last thing he wants is a bunch of people telling him what they think he wants to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of whether or not it was the majority opinion of those who were giving him advice that the photos should not be released?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was a majority opinion, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, can you give us anything more about this team that will be going to, I guess, brief former President Bush?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I know you said you didn\'t want to get into operational details, but you kind of opened the door.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you can try.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you kind of opened the door on one thing.\xc2\xa0 You said that he was shot in the face, and then you corrected yourself and said \xe2\x80\x9crather the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Were you saying that he was not shot in the face?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I simply -- he was shot above the neck. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We would rather go with head if we\xe2\x80\x99re given the choice, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying it was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\'t have any details to give you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why has the President decided not to speak at Ground Zero tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely fitting and appropriate to visit the site of Ground Zero in the wake of this significant and cathartic moment for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And he wants to lay a wreath to honor the victims, to honor the first responders who so courageously rushed to the scene and, in many cases, gave their own lives to try to save others; to honor the spirit of unity in America that we all felt in the wake of that terrible attack.\xc2\xa0 I think the power of that requires no words. And he will also meet with families of the victims and first responders in private.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a debate on whether to speak and, to use his expression, was there concern that it would look like spiking the ball?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t forget the President -- no, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a debate, but the President did speak on Sunday night and a remarkably large audience in this country, a remarkable number of Americans saw him speak because the word traveled so fast about this monumental event that had occurred.\xc2\xa0 And so, no, there was no debate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question on the New York Times/CBS poll.\xc2\xa0 His approval rating jumped 11 points from 46 to 57, but at the same time, his approval on the economy is the lowest ever in this poll, 34 percent.\xc2\xa0 If you could just comment on if you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any significance to all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the country is still emerging from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 I think that gas prices have weighed heavily on Americans as they try to make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely understandable why that sentiment is out there because people are struggling.\xc2\xa0 And people, in the case of how they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with these high gas prices, are suffering.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s -- we are fully aware of that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this President, I think you will see, will continue his focus on growing the economy, creating jobs, on working with Congress to pass legislation that does that; working with Congress to take measures that reduce our deficit, that invest in those areas that allow us to grow, allow us to compete; make sure that we educate our kids so we can be competitive in the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, the remarkable thing to me, watching\xc2\xa0 -- being on the inside now, is -- you always hear this, right -- is that the train never stops.\xc2\xa0 The speed, the rapidity of events, and the demands are so great.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in these historic times since the President came into office is that that has been the case and then some.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd his focus on the economy has not wavered, even as he has dealt very quietly, with only a select number of people, with this mission from its inception to its execution.\xc2\xa0 And that focus will continue.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no -- the two things that he thinks about the most, the security of the American people and the economic security of the American people, at the same time.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the economy continues to be a major priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing more and more lawmakers are seeing the bin Laden photo or photos.\xc2\xa0 To be clear, are they just being shown the photos, or are there copies floating around the Hill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any photos being -- floating or being shown.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden -- Sunday when the raid happened, was there any opportunity for U.S. officials to question him before he was shot?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into operational details about -- beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past yesterday is what I would say today.\xc2\xa0 So what happened on Sunday night is that an incredibly courageous team of U.S. personnel entered a foreign country in darkness on an incredibly risky mission, executed it at great risk to their own personal safety, executed that mission with great professionalism, and accomplished a goal that this country had sought for nine and a half years, in a mission that dramatically minimized collateral damage and civilian casualties, that was pulled off without any casualties among American personnel, and it resulted in the bringing to justice of Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 We have enormous regard for what was accomplished on Sunday by those men.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re American heroes.\xc2\xa0 I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if they got a question in before --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would just refer those questions to the Defense Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question real fast.\xc2\xa0 Any attempt by American officials to interview, question bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wife who was there at the scene?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but you might ask the State Department that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any U.S. officials involved in the questioning of anybody else at that compound?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that goes to that, what Mike just asked, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer.\xc2\xa0 We obviously cooperate and have an important relationship with Pakistan and with the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information with which to answer that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they sending briefings of their interrogation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- I just don\'t know, so -- I don\'t have an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be an updated narrative on what you read yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I made pretty clear that we have provided a great deal of information, and have made an effort to get that information to you very quickly.\xc2\xa0 The nature of this operation and the rapidity with which we tried to respond to the desire for -- understandable desire for information about it has meant that we needed to clarify some facts.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any more operational details for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you done clarifying?\xc2\xa0 This is it?\xc2\xa0 This is the final narrative?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more operational details for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is final?\xc2\xa0 Will we have any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t draw any lines like that.\xc2\xa0 It would be foolish to.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- we don\'t have any information for you today.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a great deal of information for you about that operation.\xc2\xa0 Our focus and I think most people\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on the remarkable nature of what was accomplished, the fact that it was done with no American casualties and very limited collateral damage, and done in a way that we could be entirely sure that Osama bin Laden had been brought to justice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, one more on the issue of 9/11 families.\xc2\xa0 Given that many members of Congress are being shown this photo, if they ask to see the photo under some circumstance that would not be public but for them, if they ask for that opportunity, would the administration be open to giving them that opportunity?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, may I follow up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Jared.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I spoke on I believe it was Monday with the chairman of the 9/11 Commission.\xc2\xa0 He said one of the glaring recommendations that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been implemented yet is giving -- or freeing up radio spectrum for the first responders.\xc2\xa0 Where does the administration stand on that -- so the first responders can communicate amongst each other when --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question, Jared, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, I know you answered this, but can you clarify -- you said no visual evidence at all is going to be released, including video or anything of that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, visual record of Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s death or his deceased body.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just one on a different topic, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any expectations -- or what expectations does the administration have for the meeting tomorrow that Biden is hosting with congressional leaders?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think this is the beginning of an important process.\xc2\xa0 The President, by appointing the Simpson-Bowles commission, by putting forward the plan he did at George Washington University for his vision for reducing our deficit in a balanced way while investing in the essential priorities of government to allow us to grow and allow us to create jobs -- he has now taken this step to move this process forward because he believes that we\xe2\x80\x99re at an important point here where Republicans and Democrats alike share -- recognize the problem -- that\xe2\x80\x99s important -- and they agree that it exists.\xc2\xa0 They share the same end goal, which is $4 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And they share the same general idea of what the timeline should be, 10 to 12 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis created the potential for a bipartisan compromise on some of this, at least.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what this process we hope will launch on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 And so we -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- there will be no announcement after that meeting that a deal has been reached, because this is a process.\xc2\xa0 But we expect progress to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, just trying to get some clarity here.\xc2\xa0 Why did the narrative released yesterday not mention bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s son?\xc2\xa0 Was he killed in the raid?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re -- this is the kind of thing that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying not to, first of all, go beyond what I said yesterday, and secondly, to -- what I would just say is that for questions like that I refer you to the Defense Department and they may be able to get an answer for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because John Brennan on Monday gave one name, and it turns out that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I think this has been made clear.\xc2\xa0 This is an important point.\xc2\xa0 The transcript -- he gave a name; it is the correct name.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, when the transcript was listened to and put on paper an error was made in transcribing that name.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve corrected that and what he said was accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was any other person, dead or alive, taken from the compound and transported from the scene by --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- U.S. personnel?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on tomorrow, is there a -- does the President have concern about possibly exploiting 9/11 families?\xc2\xa0 Does he want to keep some of this private?\xc2\xa0 What can we expect --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting in private with 9/11 families.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I mean, is there any in public --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In private.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So what are the public events then tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to the World Trade Center site and laying a wreath in public.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that will be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did he decide to make these meetings all private tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you said so in your question.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you suggested why that would be the case.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about -- he wants to meet with them and share with them this important and significant moment -- a bittersweet moment, I think, for many families of the victims.\xc2\xa0 And he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to do that in private.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did he want to invite President Bush?\xc2\xa0 And what is lost by President Bush not being there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama wanted to invite and did invite President Bush because as he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear on Sunday night and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, that this is a moment of unity for Americans and a moment to recall the unity that existed in this country in the wake of the attacks on 9/11.\xc2\xa0 And he wanted to -- he invited President Bush because he had hoped that if President Bush were able to come that he would join the President in visiting the World Trade Center site.\xc2\xa0 We completely understand that he\xe2\x80\x99s not able to come, but the invitation was made in that spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow on Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question earlier, when CIA Director Panetta spoke both to NBC and to lawmakers on the Hill, he was pretty clear that it was a question of when, not if, the photos would be released.\xc2\xa0 So was he misinformed, or was he overruled?\xc2\xa0 And what --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The decision -- a final decision had not been made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he spoke out of line, out of turn?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President made a decision.\xc2\xa0 It was -- there are obviously arguments to be made on each side of this, but the final decision was not made until today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he was wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The final decision was not made until today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This morning.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have -- I don\'t remember precisely.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t look at my watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were with him when he made the decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I clarify just one thing?\xc2\xa0 When you talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s role tomorrow in New York, are you ruling out that he\xe2\x80\x99ll make some comments, perhaps even informal ones?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no plan for him to speak at the wreath-laying ceremony.\xc2\xa0 His events with the families and first responders are in private.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- as was the case the other day when he didn\'t speak at the Cabinet meeting, I obviously don\'t -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not a robot, and he could potentially speak at some point tomorrow, but there are no plans for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to anyone on the team that carried out the mission?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information for you on that at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if anyone in the White House has?\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it depends.\xc2\xa0 The team is a big -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not just those men who went into Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an obviously bigger network that represents the team, the operation team.\xc2\xa0 And I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there is the head of Special Forces who obviously has spoken to members of the administration and he\xe2\x80\x99s very much part of the team.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about more contact.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.N.\xe2\x80\x99s top human rights official said yesterday that she hoped the administration would release full details about the operation in order to settle any questions about whether it was legally justifiable.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration feel or have any plans that it needs to say anything more about how the operation was carried out, the rules of engagement, to justify the action that happened on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me address that question and I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- forgive me, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read so I\xe2\x80\x99m very precise here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe team had the authority to kill Osama bin Laden unless he offered to surrender; in which case the team was required to accept his surrender if the team could do so safely.\xc2\xa0 The operation was conducted in a manner fully consistent with the laws of war.\xc2\xa0 The operation was planned so that the team was prepared and had the means to take bin Laden into custody.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere is simply no question that this operation was lawful. Bin Laden was the head of al Qaeda, the organization that conducted the attacks of September 11, 2001.\xc2\xa0 And al Qaeda and bin Laden himself had continued to plot attacks against the United States.\xc2\xa0 We acted in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s self-defense.\xc2\xa0 The operation was conducted in a way designed to minimize and avoid altogether, if possible, civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 And if I might add, that was done at great risk to Americans.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, consistent with the laws of war, bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s surrender would have been accepted if feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s my response.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 One, what President Obama did on Sunday, he became hero around the globe because he gave relief to the millions of people, including in India.\xc2\xa0 India was the victim for the last 20 years of this terrorism.\xc2\xa0 Also, my question is, when President spoke with President Zardari, what was the reaction from Pakistan as far as -- and other leaders that he has spoken to -- what are they saying now inside Pakistan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for the Pakistani government, and I think in terms of our analysis of the reaction within Pakistan, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the State Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President of Pakistan obviously wrote an op-ed the other day.\xc2\xa0 I think you can glean some information from that.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of other leaders, the President did speak with a number of leaders from around the world and they all congratulated the United States on this accomplishment, bringing to justice Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other characterization to give you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why I ask that, for the last 10 years this is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying here and the White House and the State Department and the Pentagon that Osama is living and protected by the Pakistani intelligence and military and living like a maharaja.\xc2\xa0 And you can see on Sunday what the whole world saw, how his lifestyle was there inside Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 So don\xe2\x80\x99t you think now Pakistan has to -- so many questions have to answer to the international community and to the United States and also millions of people that he has been --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What John Brennan said and what I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat is that we obviously are interested in finding out the details of the support network that obviously helped Mr. bin Laden hide in Abbottabad.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know the members of that support network.\xc2\xa0 We also note that the Pakistani government has launched an investigation of its own, and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And we will work to find out as much as we can about how that happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI would then further state that our relationship with Pakistan, while complicated, is very important, and it is very important precisely because of our need to continue the fight against al Qaeda, to continue the fight against terrorists.\xc2\xa0 The fight is not done, and we look forward to cooperating with Pakistan in the future.\xc2\xa0 As others have said, more terrorists have been killed on Pakistani soil than probably any other country.\xc2\xa0 And the cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve received from Pakistan has been very useful in that regard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second if I may --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s third, but okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 What President said Sunday was good that war is not against Islam or the Muslims.\xc2\xa0 But my question is that in order to bring Muslim community, including in the U.S., because they are saying that they are being targeted, and Congressman King\xe2\x80\x99s also had hearings on Muslims.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t you think there is now time for President to speak globally to the Muslim people that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements for other speeches.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement on Sunday stand for itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify, has the President indicated to you in any way that he wants you to stop giving out any clarifications or information?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or that he wants DOD to stop?\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99re directing us in that spirit --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My point is simply -- this is just to make the point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a great number of details.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any new details for you to provide.\xc2\xa0 And there are issues here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, a lot of you people understand, a lot of the reporters here have covered and written about or done pieces on special operations and the kinds of operations that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here, and there are equities we need to protect.\xc2\xa0 It would be extremely foolhardy for us to divulge information in the recounting of what happened on Sunday that would in some way -- in any way limit our capacity to perform a similar operation in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re not done going after terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Would that we were, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you suggesting that to answer Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question or any of these questions today would harm national security, compared to the details that you were giving out for the last two days?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we have given out a great number of details.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more details for you.\xc2\xa0 You can certainly ask the Defense Department for more details.\xc2\xa0 But I think the -- the point here is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve divulged an extraordinary amount of information about this operation, and we don\'t want to divulge any information that would impede our capacity to launch a similar operation in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think that\'s entirely reasonable.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, that the level of detail and the amount of information has been rather extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 And there has to be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have to clarify --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we did.\xc2\xa0 And there has to be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can\xe2\x80\x99t we keep doing that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you can ask, but the point is, is that I don\'t have any clarifications for you.\xc2\xa0 What I said yesterday stands.\xc2\xa0 And I clarified a couple of points.\xc2\xa0 And the problem is, is that if we engage in this kind of thing, it leads to those areas that unwittingly could have the divulging of information that would limit our capacity to do this kind of operation in the future.\xc2\xa0 And that would be a grave error.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me follow up on something that you said we might be able to get.\xc2\xa0 On the Vinson was there a pathologist who would have made a written record of the body --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and would there have been a written record of a burial at sea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s always a written naval record of a burial at sea.\xc2\xa0 Could we have a copy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That may be possible, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not making that promise.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m -- the point I -- the question I was addressing, the question the President addressed was photographs and video.\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- and the decision not to release that is related to the image, images, and the potential harm that could cause by releasing those.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you ask?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- yes.\xc2\xa0 And I will ask.\xc2\xa0 But, again, there is no point in trying to tease out all these details about an operation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a great number of details on and which, again, is the kind of operation that -- elements of which need to be protected for obvious reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you say with certainty that bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s hideout would have been found without the enhanced interrogation techniques that were done under the Bush administration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say with certainty that no single piece of information, with the exception of the address of the compound, was vital to this -- was singularly vital to this -- because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about tiny bits of information that were compiled by unbelievably competent professionals over nine and a half years.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know if one piece of information came from one source and was corroborated in another way, if -- which thread held the cloth together -- with the exception of the location of the compound.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply note that that has not been -- only been in existence for five or six years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just finish answering his question?\xc2\xa0 That would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe fact is, is that information was gathered from detainees -- we have multiple ways of gathering information -- from detainees, from different methods that we have of getting information.\xc2\xa0 The work that was done to put the case together was done primarily by analysts gathering tiny bits of information, putting it together and creating a body of work, if you will, that led to the finding of the location where Osama bin Laden was hiding.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up.\xc2\xa0 It sounds to me at the very least like what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that the interrogation techniques cannot be ruled out as a critical and necessary piece to have found bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that that is true?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that there is no single piece of information beyond the location of the compound where Osama bin Laden was hiding out that was incontrovertibly critical to the success of this operation on Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, I can\xe2\x80\x99t categorically rule out that one piece of -- because we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re missing a sort of bigger picture here, which is that the incredibly hard and focused work of our intelligence community, intelligence professionals, who don\xe2\x80\x99t get credit because they\xe2\x80\x99re so often -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t name them and identify them and stand them up and celebrate them -- to this success.\xc2\xa0 And then joint intel, IC, military cooperation led to the remarkably successful mission on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 And that I think is a testament to the focused determination of the American people to do what we said we would do after 9/11, right up to Sunday, which was we were going to bring Osama bin Laden to justice, and we would keep looking for him and we would find him and bring him to justice.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point, the President used that in the transcript that you read from at the top of the briefing, that Osama bin Laden had received justice.\xc2\xa0 Is that what the SEALs went in to do, was deliver justice, or did they go in to take him into custody so he could be tried --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just went through a whole litany of what their assignment was.\xc2\xa0 It involved --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it seems like an important message, though.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is how it\xe2\x80\x99s being perceived around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we absolutely -- and if he had surrendered and we could have done -- brought him into custody safely, then that would have been bringing him to justice as well.\xc2\xa0 But he was brought to justice on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate that, given the circumstances, that he was brought to justice in the way he was.\xc2\xa0 The professionals on the ground made -- put themselves at great risk and accomplished their mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just said that we are not done going after terrorists.\xc2\xa0 The Pakistani government said in a statement that Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s raid was an \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized unilateral action.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So how does that statement -- how would that statement sort of affect any future special operations that might take place for another person believed to be involved with al Qaeda?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have a complicated but vital and important relationship with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t agree on everything, but their cooperation has been essential in the fight against al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work on that relationship and seek that cooperation and receive it.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to seek and find and bring to justice terrorists who are plotting to do harm to Americans and our allies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would you use the same method -- the same methods that were used on Sunday, even after --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical, but certainly that method was very effective and was entirely lawful.\xc2\xa0 And as I said before, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to preclude the use of that method by anything I might say from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Different subject, Jay?\xc2\xa0 In his meeting with the Prince of Wales this afternoon, will the President express any interest in meeting Prince William and Kate Middleton on his visit to the U.K. later this month?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 He might --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday that he would congratulate the Prince.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will congratulate Prince Charles, but beyond that, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t predict.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tStephen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just following that question there -- are you saying that the U.S. reserves the right to, as the President said back in the campaign, if Pakistan will not act against terror suspects, to go and enter Pakistani territory and act against them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 He made very clear during the campaign that that was his view.\xc2\xa0 He was criticized for it.\xc2\xa0 He maintained that that was his view, and by the actions he has taken as President, feels that it was the right approach and continues to feel that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President concerned about incitement from the photographs if, indeed, bin Laden was in fact the Charles Manson of the Muslim world?\xc2\xa0 Do you paint him as not a Muslim?\xc2\xa0 Do you describe him as an extremist?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Muslim leader.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you say, yet, the showing of his dead body will incite --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no need to publish those photographs to establish that Osama bin Laden was killed.\xc2\xa0 And it is not, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, necessary or prudent to do that because of the possible inflammatory nature of those photographs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is it inflammatory, if he is not in fact a Muslim leader?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is a long history of images like that being used to rally opinion against people, to turn people in those photographs into heroes, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in doing that.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re also, as Americans, not interested, as the President said, in trotting around photographs as trophies.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are, and so we won\xe2\x80\x99t do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Muslims have told me they would like to see the photographs because --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it would show the enemy dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding a historical agreement between Hamas and Fatah today, and Egypt today, Prime Minister Netanyahu called this a blow -- a blow to peace and great victory for terrorism.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on this statement?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with Netanyahu?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We understand that Fatah and Hamas have reached a reconciliation agreement.\xc2\xa0 What is important now is that Palestinians ensure implementation of that agreement, that its implementation advances the prospects of peace, rather than undermines those prospects.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to seek details, more information about the nature of the agreement, and we\xe2\x80\x99re consulting with the parties about these very issues.\xc2\xa0 And I refer you to the Palestinians for details on the agreement because we\xe2\x80\x99re still seeking them ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But many people think that without solving Palestine issue, terrorist activities will not disappear in that region.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s imperative for the parties involved to sit down and negotiate a lasting peace.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made that clear and he continues to believe that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just another different topic on electric company, Sony. Sony\xe2\x80\x99s network was attacked by unauthorized outsiders, and they were -- more than 100 million people\xe2\x80\x99s information has been taken to the outside.\xc2\xa0 Congress has started to criticize them.\xc2\xa0 There was a hearing today and some didn\xe2\x80\x99t attend.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the view on the situation by the administration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the details of that and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an administration view for you. But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take that question if you get back to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up, on the Middle East, does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good time now to start an initiative on the peace process?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has believed since he took office that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to move forward with the peace process -- no time like the present.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:11 P.M.
