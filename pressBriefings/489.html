Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:18 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Happy Monday.\xc2\xa0 I hope everyone is recovered from prom and had a fine time on what turned out to be a glorious weekend weather-wise.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you can see, I have with me today John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President.\xc2\xa0 He is no stranger to many of you or even to this briefing room.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s here to talk about issues around energy and energy efficiency that the President will be discussing this week.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll make a presentation at the top and stay for questions on his issue areas.\xc2\xa0 As we traditionally do, if you could direct questions to him at the top, and then when that\'s done, we\'ll let him go and I\'ll remain for questions on other subjects.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with that, I give you John Podesta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good to be back here.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Not really.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You know I don\'t lie.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I\'m going to run through a few slides.\xc2\xa0 As Jay noted, President Obama pledged to make 2014 a year of action, and the administration and the American economy are firing on all cylinders when it comes to producing more energy, cleaner energy, and more energy efficiency, as well as combating climate change. We prepared a few slides -- because we\'re doing a number of activities this week -- to give you some background and provide some context that were done by the CEA -- Jason is out of town today, so forgive me, I don\'t have a Ph.D. in economics, but I think I can walk you through these slides.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first one -- I think you all have copies -- the United States is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world and the largest producer of gas and oil in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\'s projected that the United States will continue to be the largest producer of natural gas through 2030.\xc2\xa0 For six straight months now, we\'ve produced more oil here at home than we\'ve imported from overseas.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s all a good-news story.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGo to the next slide.\xc2\xa0 Domestic energy production is boosting economic growth overall.\xc2\xa0 In 2012 and 2013, it accounted for .22 and .24 percent of growth, which is the highest on record.\xc2\xa0 If you go to the next slide, as you can see, that\'s had a direct impact on employment.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve added 133,000 jobs in the last three years in the oil and natural gas extraction sector, and those numbers are projected to continue to grow.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time as we\'ve been producing more oil and natural gas at home we\'re cutting our energy usage dramatically, improving energy efficiency.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of what the President means when he says that we have an \xe2\x80\x9call of the above\xe2\x80\x9d energy strategy, trying to produce more domestic energy but also using it in a much more efficient way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs this slide shows, the efficiency standards like the fuel economy standards finalized in 2012 are driving down the amount of energy necessary to produce a dollar\xe2\x80\x99s worth of goods or services.\xc2\xa0 Consumption of gasoline is well below the expected trend lines that you can see from 2006 and even 2010.\xc2\xa0 That\'s expected -- as the energy efficiency standards come into place that go out to 2025, that\'s expected to save consumers $1.7 trillion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we\'re evolving a cleaner overall energy mix even as we boost domestic oil and natural gas production and improve efficiency.\xc2\xa0 Renewable energy is on the rise -- it\'s some of the fastest-growing part of our energy mix.\xc2\xa0 Cleaner burning natural gas is the only fossil fuel that\'s growing as a share of the energy mix.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese trends will keep the United States\xe2\x80\x99 economy competitive.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the U.S. economy growing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll help us achieve the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSince President Obama took office, we\xe2\x80\x99ve increased electricity generation from solar by more than 10 times and tripled electricity production from wind power.\xc2\xa0 Last year\xe2\x80\x99s solar energy was the second-largest source of new electricity added to the grid after natural gas.\xc2\xa0 Every four minutes, another home or business went solar.\xc2\xa0 Federal government is doing its part to make sure that these trends continue and more energy is produced by clean renewable sources like wind and solar.\xc2\xa0 Five years ago there was not one renewable energy project on the hundreds of millions of acres of public lands; today, DOI is on track to issue permits for enough renewable energy generation on public lands to power 6 million homes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd finally, power plants that create electricity by burning fossil fuels are still the largest single source of CO2 emissions in the U.S. -- in 2012, they\xe2\x80\x99ve accounted for 38 percent of CO2 emissions and 31 percent of greenhouse gas emissions overall.\xc2\xa0 The transition to natural gas increases and efficiency, and deployment of more renewables has meant that our CO2 emissions from energy production are trending in the right way, and that is down.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we have more work to do.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re up to this week and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just finish -- just give you a sense of where we are.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working every day to implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s Climate Action Plan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made, I think, important gains on all three fronts of the Climate Action Plan that he released last year:\xc2\xa0 Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about; building resilience in American communities to the climate impacts we know are coming; and leading the international negotiations to tackle this global challenge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis week, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking further actions.\xc2\xa0 An important part of the Climate Action Plan was calling forth the National Climate Assessment.\xc2\xa0 That will be released tomorrow here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 As part of that release, the President will be spending some time speaking to meteorologists about what the report\xe2\x80\x99s findings will mean for communities across America.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis third National Climate Assessment will be the most authoritative and comprehensive source of scientific information ever produced about how climate change is going to impact all regions of the United States and key sectors of the national economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a tremendous undertaking -- hundreds of the best climate scientists from across the U.S., not just in the public sector but in the private sector as well, have worked over the last four years to produce this report.\xc2\xa0 This assessment is about presenting actionable science.\xc2\xa0 We expect it will contain a huge amount of practical, useable knowledge that state and local decision-makers can take advantage of as they plan for the impacts of climate change and work to make their communities more resilient.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLater in the week, starting on Wednesday, the administration is going to be holding a three-day Better Buildings Summit here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 In February of 2011, the President launched the Better Buildings Challenge to help American commercial and industrial buildings become at least 20 percent more efficient by 2020.\xc2\xa0 More than 120 diverse organizations representing over 2 billion square feet of real estate are already on track to meet that 2020 goal and cut their energy use by 2.5 percent annually. These efforts obviously save families and businesses money on their utility bills, they reduce energy demand, and they help us to achieve our climate goals by reducing greenhouse emissions. This week\xe2\x80\x99s events will highlight the progress for our private and public sector.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, finally, coming out of last month\xe2\x80\x99s White House Solar Summit, anticipating this week\xe2\x80\x99s Better Buildings Summit, the President has been using the power of his phone, and all of us in the White House have been working to get more commitments from more partners on these key sectors to get more efficiency in our build sector, more deployment of solar across the economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some announcements of that at the end of the week.\xc2\xa0 We obviously need all hands on deck if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, the impacts that the IPCC warned us about just a month or so ago and that the National Climate Assessment will bring into sharp focus with respect to the U.S.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, let me go ahead and take some questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie Pace.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I had a question on power plants.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned this briefly as it relates to your last slide.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any sense about what the President is planning on the front in terms of executive actions and regulations perhaps later this year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, the President has asked the EPA to move forward to regulate existing power plants under the Clean Air Act.\xc2\xa0 He set a June 1 deadline.\xc2\xa0 I think we will meet that or be close to it.\xc2\xa0 And the EPA has modeled a proposal that\'s being reviewed through an interagency process right now, so we will propose -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a proposed rule out in the beginning of June.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the charts that you showed showed a declining use of gasoline and a greater energy -- more efficient use of gasoline.\xc2\xa0 An impact of that is that the Highway Trust Fund is running out of funds.\xc2\xa0 The Highway Trust Fund, as you know, has been the source of funding for infrastructure repair in this country.\xc2\xa0 To what extent would the administration support increasing the gas tax to replenish that fund or replace funding in some other way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we just put forward a bill on surface transportation which replaces it in a different way.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised an important point.\xc2\xa0 Stable funding for the great infrastructure needs that the United States is currently experiencing -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s crumbling roads and bridges, or building a more modern infrastructure across the board to move our goods and freight more efficiently, to make the driving experience more efficient, building more transit to move people inside urban environments -- is a pressing need.\xc2\xa0 But the Secretary of Transportation just sent legislation to the Hill last week, on Thursday, I think, that covers both what we need to do and how to pay for it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon Karl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your chart shows -- it has been a big story for a while -- the rapid increase in natural gas production, which is much cleaner than coal -- obviously a lot good about that.\xc2\xa0 How much of an environmental downside has there been to this boom in fracking and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, for the most part, there\xe2\x80\x99s been an upside as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen cleaner natural gas replacing dirtier fossil fuels in the electricity system in particular.\xc2\xa0 But there is a concern that gas that\xe2\x80\x99s fracked, if you will, that\xe2\x80\x99s produced through that method, is done in the cleanest, most efficient way. In particular, the administration released a methane strategy a couple of weeks ago that goes to the question of how we ensure that the best production methods are used in the production of both oil and gas in that process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFor the most part, that\xe2\x80\x99s regulated at the state level, but I think there are ways that the United States -- the federal government can take steps to ensure that we use the best practices, capture that methane, and ensure that, which, of course, has a heavy effect on the climate if it\xe2\x80\x99s just allowed to be released into the atmosphere.\xc2\xa0 But I think there are ways to control that and we\xe2\x80\x99re working, both in discussing that both at the oil and gas production level and also at the transportation level.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Energy has had intensive negotiations --or not negotiations -- discussions with the transportation people because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of leakage in the system at that level as well.\xc2\xa0 We need to get that methane leakage down, but I think there are practical ways to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter Alexander.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Podesta, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible for the President, as aides have suggested, to have climate change be one of the key components of his legacy and also to support the Keystone pipeline?\xc2\xa0 Are those two things in conflict, or can he accomplish both of those at once?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave that one to Jay.\xc2\xa0 As I think you know, when I came here, I said I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to work on the Keystone pipeline, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll just defer that to a later question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that most of the extraction stuff is regulated by state governments, what can the federal government do to ensure that water quality is unharmed, that geologic disturbances -- all of this reported very much by people, local people where the fracking is taking place?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we have resources at EPA that certainly can support this -- and at the Department of Energy, which has a major research program going on this -- to provide state regulators the up-to-date scientific knowledge about the best practices that can be utilized.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to work with the states to ensure that people can be reassured.\xc2\xa0 And obviously different states are going different ways on that question in terms of providing effective regulation of oil and gas production or deciding to have no production at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no government -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no federal regulations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, again, the methane strategy will produce, again, some steps to deal with that issue. But for the issue around particularly fracking fluids is largely managed at the state level.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John, when Democratic candidates hear either their opponents or challengers say that they\xe2\x80\x99re not supportive of the oil and gas industry, that the administration is not being supportive, when you look at this data and they look at this data, what is the message that they have to counter those criticisms that this administration is against oil and gas?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a big increase in both oil and gas production.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you would have seen that if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a practical approach.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, in the first term, we went through the largest oil spill in the country\xe2\x80\x99s history with the BP spill in the Gulf, but we\xe2\x80\x99re back on track to produce more oil and gas in the Gulf itself and I think with better procedures for making sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s done in a safe and effective and environmentally friendly way.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think the statistics that I just presented belie the argument.\xc2\xa0 People will make that argument, but I think that if you look at the overall -- as I said, the overall mix, it\xe2\x80\x99s cleaner; it\xe2\x80\x99s more domestically produced.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve turned the corner so that we\xe2\x80\x99re now producing more oil than we\xe2\x80\x99re importing. Those are all facts that I think that can be utilized by candidates to make the case that we\xe2\x80\x99re on the right path to have a cleaner, better and more secure, more American-made energy future for the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Podesta, this really sort of seems like the centerpiece of the President\xe2\x80\x99s pen-and-phone agenda, is energy and climate, something he can\xe2\x80\x99t really get much out of Congress. You said we need all hands on deck.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that you think you can get through Congress this year?\xc2\xa0 Anything that you\xe2\x80\x99re working on or that you see happening in Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Senate is taking up energy efficiency legislation this week.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if that can get passed and get onto the floor.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important bill.\xc2\xa0 It will move us in the right direction on energy efficiency.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s still a question of whether that will be filibustered so they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get to it this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Podesta, you mentioned the catastrophic impact of climate change.\xc2\xa0 As you survey everything that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen coming in, what do you think are the areas that need the most immediate federal attention?\xc2\xa0 So much has been written about it, how far off it is and so forth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve put out at climate.data.gov a first tranche of information about sea level rise.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s particularly going to affect communities on the Eastern Seaboard, in Florida, in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- building resilience towards what is certain to be a rising sea level is something that communities need to grapple with; they need to grapple with it right now in terms of their infrastructure investments, how they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about the future.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of experiencing major droughts in California, in the Colorado River Basin.\xc2\xa0 That comes along with greater fire risk.\xc2\xa0 And the administration has put forward a new way of budgeting on the question of fire risk going forward and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that already with intense fires already in the plains in Oklahoma, in California.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think if you have to pick two, I would say those would be two good ones to attend to.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, Peter, the President recommended a billion-dollar fund in this year\xe2\x80\x99s budget that would begin to support communities to develop climate resilience plans and do better planning -- to take a look at what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see tomorrow, which is a National Climate Assessment, which begins -- it doesn\'t localize per se, but it begins to take the climate discussion down to a regional level.\xc2\xa0 So it breaks the country apart; anticipates what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in each region.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s another separate breakout on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to the ocean and to the oceans because of increased acidification, and what the effect of that may be on the productive economies that are around, particularly coastal communities and ocean-oriented economies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think that kind of information will help communities plan, and the funding that we\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed I think will provide the resources that would be useful to give communities a jumpstart on their planning.\xc2\xa0 Some communities obviously are already on top of that as a result of catastrophic events really, particularly as a result of what happened in the Gulf with Katrina, and what happened with Superstorm Sandy in the Northeast.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to climate change doubters, you say what?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say that probably, look out your window and you\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to feel the effects.\xc2\xa0 But 97 percent of scientists agree; there\xe2\x80\x99s an overwhelming amount of evidence that exist that climate change is real, it\xe2\x80\x99s happening, it\xe2\x80\x99s caused by CO2 pollution and other pollutants that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting into our air that cause climate change.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s well-known science now.\xc2\xa0 The data continues to come in.\xc2\xa0 If anything, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some of the effects that are predicted by the models coming in more quickly than were predicted in the models that existed even a decade ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think if you want to try to -- particularly if you want to try to side with the polluters and argue to the American public that climate change is not happening -- today, tomorrow and certainly in the future, that\'s going to be a losing argument.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The statistics you presented pretty much read like a wholehearted endorsement of fracking.\xc2\xa0 And when the President was in Brussels a couple of months ago he spoke laudably of fracking, recommending that Eastern Europeans step up their technology.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, is fracking the answer to the world\xe2\x80\x99s energy needs?\xc2\xa0 Or is fracking a disincentive to develop renewable energy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 No, I think, again, we put a major emphasis on --\xc2\xa0 I quoted the statistics -- 10-time increase in solar, three times increase in wind.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very committed to renewable energy.\xc2\xa0 But at this moment, as a bridge, if you will, from a world in which there\xe2\x80\x99s still a need for fossil fuels to power our economy to a world in which we can get more from zero-carbon-source energy, whether that\'s through new technology, because we can sequester the carbon that\'s coming from the release in power plants, or from more renewables in the system, more zero carbon-source energy in the system, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a practical and viable way to reduce emissions in the short run.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo obviously there are environmental issues around the production of gas and oil, but again, in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view, that can be dealt with through the proper application of the best practices to produce that oil and gas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Time for one more.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the energy efficiency bill in the Senate. I was wondering what level of concern you have that Republicans might try to tack on kind of a pushback on some carbon emissions regulations to that bill, and what work, if any, you guys are doing to shore up Democrats in the Senate on that issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the question of whether they would -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll find various ways, particularly in the House, to try to stop us from using the authority we have under the Clean Air Act.\xc2\xa0 All I would say is that those have zero percent chance of working.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re committed to moving forward with those rules.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re committed to maintaining the authority, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to ensure that the Clean Air Act is fully implemented.\xc2\xa0 That\'s critical to the health of the American people, the health of the economy, and the health of our environment.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo they may try, but I think that there are no takers at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- with respect to the commitment of Democrats to support a cleaner energy future, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong sentiment there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s quite a bit of organization that\'s led particularly by Senator Whitehouse now in the Senate, Senator Boxer and others, Senator Markey and others, to ensure that we get the right outcome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, this is bipartisan legislation on efficiency.\xc2\xa0 We hope that it gets to the floor.\xc2\xa0 We hope that it passes.\xc2\xa0 But if it passes with unacceptable riders, then it will be headed to the watery depths, I guess.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, John.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOkay.\xc2\xa0 I thank John Podesta for joining us today.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing more from the President this week on those issues.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I go to Julie Pace once again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The violence in Ukraine has spread into Odesa.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s now in a city of a million people, a strategically important port city, if that impacts the U.S. calculus at all in terms of the response, ratcheting up a response more quickly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, we remain extremely concerned by the deteriorating situation in both eastern and southern Ukraine, where pro-Russian militants who are armed have escalated their already violent behavior and taken over additional government buildings in yet more towns.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOdesa, as you know, is in southern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to call on Russia to live up to its commitments in Geneva and to use its influence over these groups, these pro-Russian militant groups, to urge them to disarm and to instead engage in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s political process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to Odesa, I want to reiterate that we mourn with all Ukrainians the heartbreaking loss of life there on Friday.\xc2\xa0 The violence and mayhem that led to so many senseless deaths and injuries is unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 We call on all sides to work together to restore calm and law and order.\xc2\xa0 And we call on the Ukrainian authorities to launch a full investigation and to bring all of those responsible to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe events in Odesa dramatically underscore the need for an immediate deescalation of tensions in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The violence and efforts to destabilize the country must end.\xc2\xa0 And we again call for the immediate implementation of the commitments made in Geneva on April 17th.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to the general principle of violating a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, seeking to destabilize a sovereign state, the actions of Russia regardless of where they take place within Ukraine are very, very serious.\xc2\xa0 And we have called them out and we have called on them to use their influence -- that is, Russian leaders, to use their influence to prevail upon militants in eastern and southern Ukraine to disarm, to vacate the buildings they\xe2\x80\x99ve occupied and to engage in the political process in Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, there are elections scheduled for May 25th, in just a few weeks, and that is an opportunity for every Ukrainian, regardless of his or her political views, to take advantage of the democratic process to express their will.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how it should be.\xc2\xa0 Ukrainians must decide for themselves the future of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 It is not for another nation or for militants within a nation supported by and abetted by another nation to force anything upon the people of Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\'re saying in terms of the U.S. response, U.S.-Europe response, that nothing is really going to change in terms of your timeline and your set of options, even though this crisis has now moved into a pretty major city.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that we have from day one escalated our actions that impose costs on Russia as Russia has escalated its interference in and efforts to destabilize Ukraine. And as the President made clear last week when we announced new sanctions in coordination with our European and G7 partners, those costs will continue to escalate.\xc2\xa0 We have a wide range of tools available to us up to and including sectoral sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And should Russia take actions that we and our partners decide or view as meriting further escalation costs on Russia, then that\'s what we will do.\xc2\xa0 We will impose those costs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the authorities the President has available to him under the executive orders he signed give him a flexible range of tools to impose further costs and higher costs on Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to ramp up those costs, ratchet up those costs, if and as Russia continues to engage in efforts to destabilize Ukraine and fails to honor the commitments that Russia made in Geneva on April 17th.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just quickly, does the White House plan to cooperate with the House Select Committee on Benghazi?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One thing this Congress is not short on is investigations into what happened before, during and after the attacks in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 Seven separate congressional committees -- investigations, rather -- have been looking at this since 2012, including the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, House and Senate Intelligence Committees, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Armed Services Committee.\xc2\xa0 All told, these investigations have consumed 13 hearings, 50 member and staff briefings, and over 25,000 pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 And yet, what we said at the time remains true today:\xc2\xa0 In the days after September 11, 2012, we were concerned by the unrest occurring across the Muslim world and we provided our best assessment of what was happening at the time.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd all of these investigations, in addition to the work of the independent Accountability Review Board, chaired by the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appointed by George W. Bush, have found that the facts as we described them in terms of how we approached this remain exactly as we described them then.\xc2\xa0 The facts of yesterday are the facts today, and they will be the facts no matter how often or for how long Republicans engage in highly partisan efforts to politicize what was a tragedy -- a tragedy that led to the deaths of four Americans, brave Americans serving overseas, representing the United States of America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd from day one, the President has been committed to finding out what went wrong there, why security was inadequate, and in pursuing those responsible for the deaths of Americans and bringing them to justice.\xc2\xa0 And that effort will not cease.\xc2\xa0 The effort to take action to make changes because of what we saw in Benghazi when it comes to the security of our diplomats and our facilities is embodied in the immediate response that the administration took once the Accountability Review Board put out its report, which was unsparing in its assessments of the problems that existed that helped lead to that tragedy.\xc2\xa0 And then-Secretary of State Clinton adopted all 29 of the ARB\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations and began implementing them right away.\xc2\xa0 The President insisted that that take place, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we are going to continue focusing on the need to make sure that our diplomats and other Americans serving abroad are as safe as they can be.\xc2\xa0 We call upon Republicans to take a little of the time they spend investigating investigations or voting to repeal a law they will not repeal and focus on providing the funding necessary so that we can adequately provide security to our brave Americans serving overseas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to let you get on to some of my colleagues, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question of whether you\xe2\x80\x99re going to cooperate with the committee or not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, we have always cooperated with legitimate oversight.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s represented by the statistics I just read to you.\xc2\xa0 All of the seven separate congressional investigations, all of the committees that have participated in those investigations, all of the administration personnel who have briefed or testified because of those investigations -- everyone who --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there was legitimate oversight --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at even what some Republicans have said, it certainly casts doubt on the legitimacy of an effort that is so partisan in nature.\xc2\xa0 There is a problem when you have so many conspiracy theories that get knocked down by the facts and yet the adherents to those theories only become more convinced that the facts aren\xe2\x80\x99t what they so clearly are.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that information loop is fed by authorities who -- in the Republican Party, in this case -- reconfirm for those who want to believe in conspiracy theories that don\xe2\x80\x99t have any factual basis, but tell them they\xe2\x80\x99re true anyway; by media outlets that pound that message into those who are predisposed to believe it -- who, for example, continue to assert that there was a military stand-down order, which has been refuted forthrightly by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who investigated it and made sure that it was not true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt some point, you just have to assume Republicans will continue this because it feeds a political objective of some sort.\xc2\xa0 But I think, at the same time, you have to ask, what about the American people who want to see Congress actually work for them; who want to see Congress take action to raise the minimum wage or take care of the millions of Americans who are looking for work; whose benefits were cut off because Republicans would not extend them; who want Congress to help build on the recovery we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- 50 months of private sector job creation so that we invest in infrastructure, education, or innovation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re doing none of that.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they\xe2\x80\x99re investigating and investigating, and investigating investigations, and voting, of course, periodically, to repeal the Affordable Care Act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that the allegation on the other side would be that there was an attempt to politicize it with the talking points -- that that was some effort on that side to do so.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel like you need to get that message out more strongly -- that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a politicization on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s part after the fact?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think at some point it becomes necessary to actually look at what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about and review the history. Within hours -- not days, not weeks -- within hours of the very attack that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, the Republican nominee for President issued a scathingly political statement.\xc2\xa0 It was actually pointed out as such by many of you in this room or your organizations.\xc2\xa0 And that effort to politicize this tragedy has continued unabated since.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe can -- and perhaps we will -- go over again and again what the assessment was by the CIA; the points that the CIA drew up and provided to members of Congress of both parties who requested them so they could talk about it publicly, and that we provided to our representative who was going out to talk about them publicly; and the fact that that assessment by the intelligence community was based on what was said clearly to be early information, the best available information at the time, and that as more information became available, it was corrected. But at some point, as I was saying before, the facts begin not to matter to those who fervently want to believe in something else.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd when they are constantly reaffirmed in their beliefs by those who seek to gain some sort of political traction by reaffirming those beliefs, the facts themselves, the documents themselves, the testimony, what Admiral Mullen said, what the Deputy Director of the CIA said, what Ambassador Pickering said, what then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said -- none of that matters anymore if you want to believe in a certain set of conspiracies.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue focusing on the facts and what matters about this episode, which is to bring to justice the four -- I mean those who are responsible for the deaths of four Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that effort will not end and will not flag until it is accomplished.\xc2\xa0 And then to implement -- hopefully with Congress\xe2\x80\x99s help -- all of the recommendations in the Accountability Review Board\xe2\x80\x99s report, which include beefing up -- hopefully with funding provided by a Congress that seems otherwise focused on other matters -- beefing up security at diplomatic installations around the world so that all those Americans who serve, unquestionably, with some risk in dangerous places, representing us, are better protected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I change the subject quickly\xc2\xa0 -- on the Nigerian girls.\xc2\xa0 I think a report just passed while we were sitting in here that U.S. officials are heading to Nigeria. Can you clarify the U.S. response?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to go beyond intelligence-sharing, or is it already?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we view what has happened there as an outrage and a terrible tragedy.\xc2\xa0 The President has been briefed several times and his national security team continues to monitor the situation there closely.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has been in regular touch with the Nigerian government about what we might do to help support its efforts to find and free these young women.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs Secretary Kerry said, we will continue to provide counterterrorism assistance to help Nigerian authorities develop a comprehensive approach to combating Boko Haram.\xc2\xa0 We continue to stand firmly with the people of Nigeria in their efforts to bring the terrorist violence perpetrated by Boko Haram to an end while ensuring civilian protection and respect for human rights.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to what specifically we are doing, our counterterrorism assistance in Nigeria focuses on information-sharing, on improving Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s forensics and investigative capacity.\xc2\xa0 It also stresses the importance of protecting civilians and assuring that human rights are protected and respected.\xc2\xa0 We are working with the Nigerian government to strengthen its criminal justice system and increase confidence in the government by supporting its efforts to hold those responsible for violence accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are other things -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure specifics that the State Department can provide to you.\xc2\xa0 But this is an outrage and a tragedy, and we are doing what we can to assist the Nigerian government to support its efforts to find and free the young women who were abducted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just on the energy issue, if I could go back to the energy efficiency bill.\xc2\xa0 John Podesta said that the administration supports that but if there are unacceptable riders attached to it, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance of getting the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there are efforts to attach two provisions that would approve the Keystone pipeline.\xc2\xa0 Would that be an automatic veto trigger?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate, but I think you have seen from what we have said and done in the past that it is our strong view that the process around the decision-making on that pipeline has to be compartmentalized out of politics, housed and run at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 That has been the case in previous administrations of both parties and it is the case with this pipeline.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the past, when Congress has acted, it has actually served to slow down the review process, and we believe strongly that that\xe2\x80\x99s not an effective or helpful way to bring that process to a conclusion.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what Congress may or may not do -- we would be here all day -- in the end, it tends not to do much.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to focus on the issues that John talked about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could follow up on the response that you gave to the gas tax question.\xc2\xa0 I realize you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your proposal to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, but would a gas tax also be something that the administration would reject?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have never proposed or supported a gas tax.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTommy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions for you on Benghazi. First of all, there\xe2\x80\x99s a clip of Mike Morrell that\'s getting a lot of play now -- he talks about reacting to Ambassador Rice\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that the video was not something that our analysts attributed the attack to.\xc2\xa0 In the first part of that statement, he says that his reaction to her Sunday show appearance was that when she talked about the protests, that was based on the best information at the time -- right in that same sentence.\xc2\xa0 And the protests were because of the video.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, here, I think I can help you to tease this out.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the points that Mr. Morrell has many times said publicly that he oversaw and took responsibility for, the first sentence essentially says, based on currently available information, what happened in Benghazi arose out of -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing -- protests at Benghazi that were inspired by demonstrations outside of the U.S. embassy in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question that, like the demonstrations around so many of our diplomatic facilities in the Muslim world at that time, the demonstrations outside of our embassy in Cairo were inspired by anger over the video in question.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think that clearly explains what was at issue in the CIA talking points, what have been described as the CIA talking points, and what the sort of connection between, based on currently available information that was being made at the time, between the demonstrations over the video and what happened in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along and what CIA has said, and other intelligence community leaders have said, what folks in this administration have said, is that when more information became available we made it available to the public through you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in a situation like that, it is obviously complex in the sense that you have an event like that happening across the world, you have concurrently demonstrations -- highly violent and potentially very damaging demonstrations happening outside of diplomatic facilities across the Muslim world that threatened at least to become even more severe.\xc2\xa0 And that was something that was of great concern to national security officials both here and across the administration and across the world, as you would expect it would be.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is the context in which to understand how the talking points were developed and what everyone was saying about them at the time and the fact that there was contradictory information at the time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People are taking that and sort of saying that that\'s of course whatever -- my question is what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying here doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense to me.\xc2\xa0 He says -- yes, it was a protest, which were about the video, but it\'s not about the video.\xc2\xa0 My question is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tommy, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see specifically that testimony.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that Mr. Morrell has on repeated occasions made clear that those talking points were overseen by him, developed by the intelligence community, were based on the best available information they had at the time, produced at the request of and on behalf of members of Congress of both parties who wanted to be able to answer questions publicly about the event, and that we used the same points and provided them to our representative who went out to talk about it publicly.\xc2\xa0 And he has also made clear and testified that he felt absolutely no political influence as he was developing those points.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo dialing it back a year to when we had these discussions the last time, that was the focus of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xc2\xa0 And it was because that process in developing those points had been mischaracterized, because of the partisan political effort on the Hill by Republicans to reporters, that we voluntarily put out the documentation that backed up what we were saying and what Mr. Morrell was saying.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe unfortunate thing about all of this is that in the end it distracts from what the focus should be, which is that we need to take action to ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s better security for Americans, civilian Americans serving abroad at our diplomatic facilities, many of them in countries where there are inherent risks to Americans.\xc2\xa0 And we need to continue the effort to hunt down and bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of four Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus.\xc2\xa0 And we wish that it was the focus of members of Congress as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question is this:\xc2\xa0 It\'s been -- you just sort of mentioned it -- it\'s been almost a year to the day now when reports emerged -- there were reporters saying that they had obtained emails that proved that the White House had politicized the creation of the talking points.\xc2\xa0 And then as you said, it turned out these were not actually emails, they were inaccurate summaries that were fed to them by Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Now we fast-forward a year later.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the same reporters saying that they now have an email that proves the same thing.\xc2\xa0 So I guess what I want to know is that -- it seems like you\'re expecting the American people -- how do you expect them to believe that the same guy is wrong about the exact same thing two years in a row?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tommy, I think our interest really is not in playing that game.\xc2\xa0 It\'s in making clear that we\'re focused on the things I talked about -- ensuring that our diplomats are secure.\xc2\xa0 And we need Congress\xe2\x80\x99s help, we need Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 help in providing the funding necessary to take care of that -- that is reflected in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget -- and in continuing the investigation and the effort to bring to justice those who killed four Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe rest of this, or so much of the rest of this is so clearly and unfortunately partisan that I suspect, as I said earlier, that no matter how many committees look into it and how many investigations of investigations of investigations there are, or how many highly credentialed and admired people in the military and our civilian service who testify to the facts, when the facts won\'t be enough, the political, partisan process will continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s unfortunate for only one reason, which is that we all have a limited amount of time in the day to focus on things, and that includes members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And all the time they spend investigating this and investigating other matters, or voting to repeal a bill or a law that has led to more than 8 million Americans signing up for private health insurance, the less time they have to try to focus on the things that Americans really care about, which is the economy and helping it grow, and investing in a way that rewards hardworking Americans for the hard work they do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You called on Alexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re out there defending your colleague.\xc2\xa0 She was excellent in that video, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That was a great production.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 So just to follow up on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which one?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 You went to great lengths to suggest that because it\xe2\x80\x99s a partisan, political effort on Capitol Hill, according to the White House, the administration is not going to cooperate with a select committee investigation.\xc2\xa0 Because of the amount of time that you just spent in the briefing room and we would assume be spending talking about this again when they get going, just to clarify, the administration is not going to cooperate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point you to the fact that we have always cooperated with legitimate oversight and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 And we have cooperated extensively with the oversight on this matter -- which I think a lot of folks, including Republicans, have identified as not always legitimate, but highly political.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are many people, including if you look at some of the Republicans on the Sunday shows yesterday, who believe that this is necessary after seven congressional investigations and multiple committees have looked into it.\xc2\xa0 And so I think you can make your assessment about how serious it is and how serious-minded an approach is, which is so clearly designed to politicize what was a tragedy that again perpetuates -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like a conspiracy theory without a conspiracy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFundamentally, it has always been about were we trying to perpetuate a myth about what happened in Benghazi, when -- I mean, once the intelligence community changed its assessment we put it right out there.\xc2\xa0 And it was a murky situation in which we were providing the best available information, conservatively relying on the intelligence community\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that it was providing to Congress.\xc2\xa0 And when that assessment changed, of course, our assessment changed.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think if you look at it, it still remains murky exactly what happened, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll never know until the investigations are complete and the investigation into who killed those Americans is complete and they\xe2\x80\x99re brought to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut that\xe2\x80\x99s -- as I said before, at some point, when the conspiracy theories sort of fall flat and yet there is a fierce adherence to the notion that the conspiracy exists, you just have to continue to focus on getting work done that\xe2\x80\x99s important to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And we can talk about this as much as you want in this room, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change the facts, because none of this is going to change the facts as they existed then, as they exist now, or they will in the future.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second question -- on Arkansas.\xc2\xa0 There are folks in Arkansas who are wondering why it took the President so long to come to their state, which he will do this week.\xc2\xa0 Can you just comment on why it took a long time for President Obama to get there?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those comments.\xc2\xa0 The President is visiting in two days.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean as President, not after the disaster.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, say that again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just people are saying it took him a long time to come.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not after the disaster.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to respond to that, except to say the President is focused and will be focused when he visits on Wednesday on the families of victims and on the first responders, and on the efforts underway to help Arkansas rebuild.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWendell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of your skepticism of this committee is fueled by Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of Trey Gowdy as the chair -- Gowdy, is a member of the oversight committee which has been pretty tough on you guys?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think my view on this has less to do with personalities than on the fact that there have been nothing but investigations into this matter for the past 18 months by multiple committees, with 25,000-plus pages of documents turned over, many, many briefings, much testimony, and all have failed to provide Republicans what they have desired politically, which is some proof of a conspiracy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd remember, this all began with a statement put out by the Republican nominee for President within hours of the attack, and the effort to politicize this has continued unabated, which is unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But it is what it is, and it has been what it has been.\xc2\xa0 And I suppose that this won\xe2\x80\x99t change, just like the facts won\xe2\x80\x99t change.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to focus on the things that I think the American people wish Washington were more focused on, which is the kinds of issues that Mr. Podesta, John Podesta, was talking about earlier:\xc2\xa0 How do we make the kind of investments that assure that we get the national security advantage that comes from greater energy independence, as well as the economic and environmental advantage that comes from it so that our air is cleaner for our children, our water is cleaner for our children, and we are safer and more economically efficient?\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of things -- and that we\xe2\x80\x99re creating all the jobs that come with these kinds of investments.\xc2\xa0 I think that is probably a lot higher on the list of average Americans in terms of what they\xe2\x80\x99d rather see Washington do than layering on another investigation by the same folks of the things they\xe2\x80\x99ve already investigated.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senators McCain, Graham and Ayotte want to confirm a report by a former White House staffer that the President did not monitor the events going down in Benghazi from the Situation Room that night.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President was briefed regularly by his senior national security team as events were unfolding.\xc2\xa0 As you may recall, he was first alerted to the attack in Benghazi while he was meeting with Leon Panetta in the Oval Office and at that moment, told Secretary of Defense Panetta that he wanted every effort expended to do everything we can to assist in the situation in Benghazi and make sure that our diplomats were secure around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And he was constantly updated.\xc2\xa0 We put out photographs of that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, this is a conspiracy theory in search of a conspiracy.\xc2\xa0 And it has clearly been that for so long now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost track of the number of conspiracies that have fallen flat -- conspiracy theories.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, on Ukraine, are you concerned that this uptick in violence that\xe2\x80\x99s spread to Odesa, the continuing violence in east Ukraine really threatens the May 25th elections? And are you likely to tighten sanctions before then, as some have called on you to do?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are concerned that Russia seeks to undermine the May 25th elections.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said last week, we will be working with our European and G7 partners to respond appropriately should that be the case.\xc2\xa0 It is vitally important that the Ukrainian people get to express their free, democratic will in national elections and that every Ukrainian avails himself or herself of the right to vote, and votes according to his or her convictions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how the process should work.\xc2\xa0 It is not for Moscow to dictate to Ukraine or to Ukrainians what the future of Ukraine should be.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that as Russia escalates its efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, the cost to Russia will escalate.\xc2\xa0 We have a very flexible set of tools available to us to impose additional costs and that is, as you saw last week, up to and including sectoral sanctions on the economy, on the Russian economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCarol, and then Jon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the abduction of Nigerian girls, can you talk about what kind of assistance the U.S. is planning to offer the Nigerian government beyond basic intelligence and information-sharing?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re also pursuing efforts to help the Nigerian military improve its professional military education to bolster its counter IED capacity and carry out responsible CT operations.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the United States last year provided approximately $3 million in law enforcement assistance to Nigeria, which included assistance to develop the Nigerian capacity to search, identify, mitigate and dispose of IEDs and related materials; a resident legal attach\xc3\xa9 in Lagos and FBI agents who have assisted Nigerian authorities in investigating bombings there; and training for Nigerian law enforcement officials on basic forensics, interview and interrogation techniques, hostage negotiations, leadership and management development, and task force development.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the U.S. also supports programs and initiatives that provide positive alternatives to communities most at risk of radicalization and recruitment, including through vocational training.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that last year, we designated Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization and specifically-designated global terrorists, which effectively cuts the organization off from U.S. financial institutions and enables banks to freeze assets here in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, to follow on Wendell on Ukraine -- just to be clear, is it fair to say you, the administration, is considering additional sanctions against Russia before the May 25th elections based on things that are currently -- the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last few days?\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get a sense of is whether May 25th is a hard deadline for any new sanctions, or if you\xe2\x80\x99re leaving open the possibility of still levying some type of sanctions against Russia between now and then, based on action that\xe2\x80\x99s been happening the last few days or could happen in the next few days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The latter is the case.\xc2\xa0 We never set artificial deadlines on when we would begin considering new sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve always made clear that the tools available to the President allow him and this administration to escalate the costs if activity by Russia aimed at destabilizing Ukraine escalates.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- nor am I saying that sanctions are coming on any particular day or will come on any particular day if Russia does this particular action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that if Russia escalates, the costs will escalate.\xc2\xa0 And we are coordinating very closely, as you heard the President and Chancellor Merkel discuss last week, with our allies and partners in Europe and on the G7, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other quick housekeeping thing -- so do you consider the select committee\xe2\x80\x99s investigation legitimate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeping?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, because everyone has asked and we can\xe2\x80\x99t get a clear answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, there is a speculative nature to that.\xc2\xa0 What I know is that Republicans continue to obsess --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have stood there speculating for the last like 20 minutes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it without saying it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99ve always cooperated with legitimate investigations, but suggesting that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to cooperate with this or at least that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as a legitimate investigation.\xc2\xa0 So do you see it as a legitimate investigation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do is speculate about what might come, or what Republicans are going to do, or how that\xe2\x80\x99s going to play out.\xc2\xa0 I think the action on that front is on Capitol Hill right now.\xc2\xa0 What I will remind you of is our history of cooperation on this issue and many others.\xc2\xa0 And I will point out to you the remarkable amount of time and energy spent by various committees in seven different investigations into this very matter.\xc2\xa0 And I will point you to the ARB investigation and to the conclusions that Ambassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen drew in their report and the recommendations they made, the clear-eyed assessments they made about some of the conspiracy theories propounded by Republicans and others on this issue, and the testimony by Mike Morell on these matters.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, again, what you have here is dissatisfaction over, I guess, the failure to prove any of these theories true and thus a decision to do it again, try it again, investigate the investigation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on where we can move forward on behalf of the American people to grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 Again, we cooperate with legitimate oversight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I just wanted to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want to ask me again?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, I just want to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to definitely get it out of me, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A yes or no answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is the White House going to cooperate with this investigation?\xc2\xa0 Yes or no?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of words but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear an answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen an investigation. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen talk.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the usual partisan assertions and heard them.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the announcements from the Speaker of the House that he\xe2\x80\x99s creating this committee to investigate this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that we have a long history of cooperating with legitimate oversight from Congress and that cooperation will continue.\xc2\xa0 What I am not going to speculate about is what the Republicans are up to.\xc2\xa0 Iit\xe2\x80\x99s pretty blatantly apparent, based on what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said and what even other Republicans have said, that this is a highly partisan exercise.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go further than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhose awesome ringtone is that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House encouraging Democrats to take part in this, to appoint members to this committee?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We leave it up to Leader Pelosi and Democrats on the Hill to decide how they want to approach this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask a follow-up on the Nigeria question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that the Nigerian government is doing everything that it can do to free those girls?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can say, Jon, is what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to assist them and how outrageous this abduction is.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that Boko Haram is a terrorist organization with heinous and malicious intent, and we are going to do everything we can to assist Nigeria in their efforts to find and free those young women, those girls.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be impolite if we were to point out that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer his question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It would be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Back on the Benghazi investigation, there seems to be frustration on Capitol Hill, particularly on behalf of Nancy Pelosi, when it comes to Republican efforts on this latest issue with Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 What is the level of frustration of President Obama when it comes to this latest probe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I would simply say that, as you heard the President discuss in his State of the Union address, and have seen in the actions that he has taken this year, he sees 2014 as an opportunity to get things done for the American people, as a year of action.\xc2\xa0 And he made clear at the beginning of the year and has proven in the actions that he has taken all year that where Congress will not join him in an effort to move forward and make progress on behalf of the American people, he will act using any authority he has to advance those interests, to help the economy, to help hardworking Americans and reward hard work.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he has been focused on all year.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we continue to look for ways to work with Congress, with members of both parties, to get important things done on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 That includes comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 There remains an opportunity for Republicans in the House to act on this important matter, something that\xe2\x80\x99s supported by a broad coalition of forces on the left and the right, including support from corners that are normally not onboard with things President Obama is in favor of.\xc2\xa0 And I think that reflects that this is something that the American people believe ought to get done and which can do enormous good to our economy, to our security, and to our capacity to innovate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President looks forward to working with Congress on any area that advances a pro-middle-class agenda and hopefully Republicans in Congress will respond to that desire.\xc2\xa0 When they don\xe2\x80\x99t, when they instead decide to spend the valuable time they have in Congress to instead investigate and investigate what\xe2\x80\x99s already been investigated, or to vote to repeal and vote to repeal a law that\xe2\x80\x99s making quality, affordable health insurance available to millions of Americans, he\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on those things that he can do using his administrative authority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you so much for that answer, but you strategically left out the part about his frustration now.\xc2\xa0 I need to get the now -- what is his frustration now about Benghazi and this latest investigation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President I think was new relatively to Washington when he took office, had been a senator for a few years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but let me get there.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the appositive phrase that begins the powerful point.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But he cannot claim to be new anymore and recognizes that partisans are going to practice partisan politics and that what we see in this effort and so many others is a desire to try to score political points -- in this case, with a base of reporters, I guess -- instead of focusing their attention on the matters that can help move the economy forward and reward hardworking Americans for the hard work that they do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s an observation that is not all that gratifying, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that has been an obvious reality for some time now.\xc2\xa0 But there remain opportunities for bipartisan cooperation like the one I just talked about and we hope -- we will continue to look and the President will continue to look for opportunities to do that with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But he will not rest in seeking the ability to, and executing on his ability to advance an agenda using his authorities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Carol\xe2\x80\x99s question, is the President or anyone here expecting to allot any new monies when it comes to this urgent issue about the Nigerian girl abduction?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the policies that we\xe2\x80\x99re implementing fall under existing budgetary authorities, but I would refer you to the State Department and USAID for other efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter Alexander.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Nigeria, is the President considering sending American troops or perhaps special forces into Nigeria, if asked, to help find those young women?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard such a request or consideration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If requested, would the President be willing to consider that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s speculation, but I had not heard even --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not because there\xe2\x80\x99s international outrage, and worldwide there have been other leaders insisting that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard -- well, this is the first I\xe2\x80\x99ve even heard that suggested.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the policies and the assistance that I outlined in my answer before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we\xe2\x80\x99re wrapping up, briefly, lastly, on a separate topic -- the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s brother was just removed from his position at Oregon State University as the head basketball coach.\xc2\xa0 The President has seen the team play on multiple Hawaii trips.\xc2\xa0 Any comment from the White House or the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s office on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the East Wing on matters like that.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tConnie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this circus tragedy in Rhode Island, do you or the President have any thoughts on these kind of stunts that are so dangerous and really shocking to young people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an official response.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty terrible accident and our thoughts and prayers go out to those were affected.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been given the hook.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:27 P.M.
